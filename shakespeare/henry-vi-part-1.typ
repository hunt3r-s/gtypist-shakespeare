 :Scene 1
 :=======
S:[Dead March. Enter the funeral of King Henry the Fifth,
 :
 :attended on by the Duke of Bedford, Regent of France;
 :
 :the Duke of Gloucester, Protector; the Duke of Exeter;
 :
S:the Earl of Warwick; the Bishop of Winchester; and
 :
 :the Duke of Somerset, with Heralds and Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
 :Comets, importing change of times and states,
 :Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
 :And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
S:
S:That have consented unto Henry's death:
 :
 :King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long.
 :
 :England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :England ne'er had a king until his time.
 :Virtue he had, deserving to command;
 :His brandished sword did blind men with his beams;
 :His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
S:
 :His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
 :
 :More dazzled and drove back his enemies
 :
 :Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.
 :
S:What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech.
 :
 :He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER
S:We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?
 :
 :Henry is dead and never shall revive.
 :
 :Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
 :
S:And Death's dishonorable victory
 :
 :We with our stately presence glorify,
 :
 :Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
 :
 :What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap
 :That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
S:Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
 :
 :Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
 :
 :By magic verses have contrived his end?
 :
S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :He was a king blest of the King of kings;
 :
 :Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day
 :So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
S:The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;
 :
 :The Church's prayers made him so prosperous.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
S:The Church? Where is it? Had not churchmen prayed,
 :
 :His thread of life had not so soon decayed.
 :
S:None do you like but an effeminate prince
 :
 :Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe.
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art Protector
 :And lookest to command the Prince and realm.
 :Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe
 :More than God or religious churchmen may.
 :
S:
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
S:Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh,
 :
 :And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
 :
 :Except it be to pray against thy foes.
 :
 :
 :BEDFORD
S:Cease, cease these jars, and rest your minds in peace!
 :
S:Let's to the altar.--Heralds, wait on us.--
 :
 :Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,
 :
 :Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.
 :
 :Posterity, await for wretched years
 :When at their mothers' moistened eyes babes shall
 :suck,
 :Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
 :And none but women left to wail the dead.
 :Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
S:
 :Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
 :
 :Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.
 :
 :A far more glorious star thy soul will make
 :
S:Than Julius Caesar or bright--
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
S:My honorable lords, health to you all.
 :
 :Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
 :
 :Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
 :
 :Guyen, Champaigne, Rheims, Roan, Orleance,
 :Paris, Gisors, Poitiers, are all quite lost.
 :
S:BEDFORD
 :
 :What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
 :
S:Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
 :
 :Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :Is Paris lost? Is Roan yielded up?
 :If Henry were recalled to life again,
 :These news would cause him once more yield the
 :ghost.
 :
S:
 :EXETER
 :
 :How were they lost? What treachery was used?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
S:No treachery, but want of men and money.
 :
 :Amongst the soldiers, this is muttered:
 :
 :That here you maintain several factions
 :
S:And, whilst a field should be dispatched and fought,
 :
 :You are disputing of your generals.
 :
 :One would have ling'ring wars with little cost;
 :
 :Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
 :A third thinks, without expense at all,
 :By guileful fair words peace may be obtained.
 :Awake, awake, English nobility!
S:Let not sloth dim your honors new begot.
 :
 :Cropped are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
 :
 :Of England's coat, one half is cut away.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :EXETER
S:Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
 :
 :These tidings would call forth her flowing tides.
 :
 :
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :Me they concern; regent I am of France.
 :Give me my steeled coat, I'll fight for France.
 :Away with these disgraceful wailing robes.
 :Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
 :To weep their intermissive miseries.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter to them another Messenger, with papers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MESSENGER
 :Lords, view these letters, full of bad mischance.
 :France is revolted from the English quite,
 :Except some petty towns of no import.
S:
 :The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;
 :
S:The Bastard of Orleance with him is joined;
 :
 :Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
 :
S:The Duke of Alanson flieth to his side.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER
 :
 :The Dauphin crowned king? All fly to him?
S:O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :We will not fly but to our enemies' throats.--
 :Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
 :
S:BEDFORD
 :
 :Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
 :
 :An army have I mustered in my thoughts,
 :
 :Wherewith already France is overrun.
 :
 :[Enter another Messenger.]
 :
S:
 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :
 :My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
 :
 :Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
 :I must inform you of a dismal fight
 :Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
 :
S:WINCHESTER
 :
 :What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is 't so?
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :O no, wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown.
 :The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
 :The tenth of August last, this dreadful lord,
 :Retiring from the siege of Orleance,
 :Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
S:
 :By three and twenty thousand of the French
 :
S:Was round encompassed and set upon.
 :
 :No leisure had he to enrank his men.
 :
 :He wanted pikes to set before his archers,
 :
 :Instead whereof, sharp stakes plucked out of hedges
 :They pitched in the ground confusedly
 :To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
 :More than three hours the fight continued,
 :Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,
 :Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.
S:
 :Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
 :
S:Here, there, and everywhere, enraged, he slew.
 :
 :The French exclaimed the devil was in arms;
 :
 :All the whole army stood agazed on him.
 :
 :His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
 :"A Talbot! A Talbot!" cried out amain
 :And rushed into the bowels of the battle.
 :Here had the conquest fully been sealed up
 :If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward.
 :He, being in the vaward, placed behind
S:
 :With purpose to relieve and follow them,
 :
 :Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
 :
 :Hence grew the general wrack and massacre.
 :
 :Enclosed were they with their enemies.
 :A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
 :Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
 :Whom all France, with their chief assembled
 :strength,
S:
 :Durst not presume to look once in the face.
 :
 :
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :
S:Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself
 :
 :For living idly here, in pomp and ease,
 :
 :Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
 :
 :Unto his dastard foemen is betrayed.
S:
 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :
 :O, no, he lives, but is took prisoner,
 :
 :And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;
 :Most of the rest slaughtered or took likewise.
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :His ransom there is none but I shall pay.
 :I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;
S:
 :His crown shall be the ransom of my friend.
 :
 :Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
 :
 :Farewell, my masters; to my task will I.
 :
 :Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
 :To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.
S:Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
 :
 :Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
 :
S:
 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :
 :So you had need; 'fore Orleance besieged,
 :
 :The English army is grown weak and faint;
 :The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
 :And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
 :Since they so few watch such a multitude.
 :[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :EXETER
 :
 :Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:
 :
 :Either to quell the Dauphin utterly
 :
 :Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :I do remember it, and here take my leave
S:To go about my preparation.	[Bedford exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can
 :To view th' artillery and munition,
 :And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
S:[Gloucester exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:EXETER
 :
 :To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
 :
 :Being ordained his special governor;
 :
 :And for his safety there I'll best devise.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER, [aside]
 :
 :Each hath his place and function to attend.
 :
 :I am left out; for me nothing remains.
 :But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office.
 :The King from Eltham I intend to steal,
S:And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
 :
 :[He exits at one door; at another door,
 :
 :Warwick, Somerset, Attendants and
 :
 :Heralds exit with the coffin.]

S:=======
 :
 :[Sound a flourish. Enter Charles the Dauphin,
 :
 :Alanson, and Reignier, marching with Drum
 :
 :and Soldiers.]
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
 :So in the Earth, to this day is not known.
S:
S:Late did he shine upon the English side;
 :
 :Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
 :
 :What towns of any moment but we have?
 :
 :At pleasure here we lie, near Orleance.
 :Otherwhiles, the famished English, like pale ghosts,
 :Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
 :
 :ALANSON
 :They want their porridge and their fat bull beeves.
S:
 :Either they must be dieted like mules
 :
 :And have their provender tied to their mouths,
 :
 :Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here?
S:Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear.
 :
 :Remaineth none but mad-brained Salisbury,
 :
 :And he may well in fretting spend his gall;
 :
 :Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
S:
 :
 :CHARLES
 :
S:Sound, sound alarum! We will rush on them.
 :
 :Now for the honor of the forlorn French!
 :
 :Him I forgive my death that killeth me
 :
 :When he sees me go back one foot, or fly.
 :[They exit. Here alarum. They are beaten
 :back by the English, with great loss.]
S:
 :
 :[Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reignier.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :Whoever saw the like? What men have I!
 :Dogs, cowards, dastards! I would ne'er have fled
 :But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
 :
S:
 :REIGNIER
 :
 :Salisbury is a desperate homicide.
 :
 :He fighteth as one weary of his life.
 :
 :The other lords, like lions wanting food,
 :Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
 :
 :ALANSON
 :Froissart, a countryman of ours, records
S:
 :England all Olivers and Rolands bred
 :
 :During the time Edward the Third did reign.
 :
 :More truly now may this be verified,
 :
S:For none but Samsons and Goliases
 :
 :It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
 :
 :Lean rawboned rascals! Who would e'er suppose
 :
 :They had such courage and audacity?
 :
S:CHARLES
 :
 :Let's leave this town, for they are hare-brained slaves,
 :
 :And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
 :
 :Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
 :The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
S:
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :
 :I think by some odd gimmers or device
 :
 :Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;
 :Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
 :By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
S:
 :
 :ALANSON  Be it so.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter the Bastard of Orleance.]
 :
 :
 :BASTARD
 :Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
 :
S:
 :CHARLES
 :
 :Bastard of Orleance, thrice welcome to us.
 :
 :
 :
S:BASTARD
 :
 :Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appalled.
 :
S:Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
 :
 :Be not dismayed, for succor is at hand.
 :
 :A holy maid hither with me I bring,
 :
 :Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,
 :Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
 :And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
 :The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
 :Exceeding the nine Sibyls of old Rome.
 :What's past and what's to come she can descry.
S:
 :Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
 :
S:For they are certain and unfallible.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :
 :Go call her in.	[Bastard exits.]
S:But first, to try her skill,
 :
 :Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;
 :
S:Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern.
 :
 :By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Bastard, with Joan la Pucelle.]
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER, [as Charles]
 :Fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
 :
S:
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
 :
 :Where is the Dauphin?--Come, come from behind.
 :
 :I know thee well, though never seen before.
 :Be not amazed; there's nothing hid from me.
 :In private will I talk with thee apart.--
 :Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while.
 :
S:
 :REIGNIER
 :
 :She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
 :
 :[Alanson, Reignier, and Bastard exit.]
 :
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
 :My wit untrained in any kind of art.
 :Heaven and Our Lady gracious hath it pleased
S:
 :To shine on my contemptible estate.
 :
 :Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
 :
 :And to sun's parching heat displayed my cheeks,
 :
 :God's Mother deigned to appear to me,
S:And in a vision full of majesty
 :
 :Willed me to leave my base vocation
 :
 :And free my country from calamity.
 :
 :Her aid she promised and assured success.
 :In complete glory she revealed herself;
 :And whereas I was black and swart before,
 :With those clear rays which she infused on me
S:That beauty am I blest with, which you may see.
 :
 :Ask me what question thou canst possible,
 :
 :And I will answer unpremeditated.
 :
 :My courage try by combat, if thou dar'st,
 :And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
 :Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate
 :If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
 :
 :CHARLES
S:
 :Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms.
 :
S:Only this proof I'll of thy valor make:
 :
 :In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
 :
 :And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
 :
 :Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :I am prepared. Here is my keen-edged sword,
 :Decked with fine flower-de-luces on each side--
S:[Aside.] The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's
 :
 :churchyard,
 :
 :Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :Then come, a' God's name! I fear no woman.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
S:
 :[Here they fight, and
 :
 :Joan la Pucelle overcomes.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon,
 :And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
 :
 :PUCELLE
S:
 :Christ's mother helps me; else I were too weak.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :
 :Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me.
 :Impatiently I burn with thy desire.
 :My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
 :Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
 :Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.
S:
 :'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
 :
 :
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :I must not yield to any rights of love,
 :For my profession's sacred from above.
 :When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
 :Then will I think upon a recompense.
 :
S:
 :CHARLES
 :
 :Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Reignier and Alanson.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER, [aside to Alanson]
 :My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
 :
 :ALANSON, [aside to Reignier]
 :Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,
 :Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
S:
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER, [aside to Alanson]
 :
 :Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
 :
 :
 :ALANSON, [aside to Reignier]
 :He may mean more than we poor men do know.
 :These women are shrewd tempters with their
 :tongues.
S:
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER, [to Charles]
 :
 :My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
 :
 :Shall we give o'er Orleance, or no?
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Why, no, I say. Distrustful recreants,
S:Fight till the last gasp. I'll be your guard.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :
 :What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Assigned am I to be the English scourge.
 :This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.
 :Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyons' days,
S:
 :Since I have entered into these wars.
 :
 :Glory is like a circle in the water,
 :
 :Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
 :
S:Till by broad spreading it disperse to naught.
 :
 :With Henry's death, the English circle ends;

 :I am come to survey the Tower this day.
 :Since Henry's death I fear there is conveyance.
 :Where be these warders that they wait not here?--
 :Open the gates! 'Tis Gloucester that calls.
S:[Servingmen knock at the gate.]
 :
 :

 :Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
 :

 :It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
 :

 :
S:Villains, answer you so the Lord Protector?

 :
 :The Lord protect him, so we answer him.

 :GLOUCESTER
 :Who willed you? Or whose will stands but mine?
 :There's none Protector of the realm but I.--
S:
 :Break up the gates! I'll be your warrantize.
 :
S:Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
 :
 :[Gloucester's men rush at the Tower gates, and
 :
S:Woodville, the lieutenant, speaks within.]
 :
 :
 :
 :WOODVILLE
 :
S:What noise is this? What traitors have we here?
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
 :Open the gates. Here's Gloucester that would enter.
 :
 :WOODVILLE
 :Have patience, noble duke, I may not open.
 :The Cardinal of Winchester forbids.
S:
S:From him I have express commandment
 :
 :That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :Fainthearted Woodville, prizest him 'fore me?
 :Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate
S:Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
 :
 :Thou art no friend to God or to the King.
 :
 :Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
 :
 :
 :SERVINGMEN
 :Open the gates unto the Lord Protector,
 :Or we'll burst them open if that you come not quickly.

S:GLOUCESTER

 :Peeled priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?

S:WINCHESTER
 :
 :I do, thou most usurping proditor--

 :And not Protector--of the King or realm.
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
 :Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord,
 :Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin!
 :I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat
S:
 :If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
S:Nay, stand thou back. I will not budge a foot.
 :
 :This be Damascus; be thou cursed Cain

 :To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back.
S:Thy scarlet robes, as a child's bearing-cloth,
 :
 :I'll use to carry thee out of this place.

S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :Do what thou dar'st, I beard thee to thy face.

 :Draw, men, for all this privileged place.
 :Blue coats to tawny coats!	[All draw their swords.]
 :Priest, beware your beard.
S:
 :I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly.
 :
S:Under my feet I'll stamp thy cardinal's hat;

 :In spite of pope or dignities of Church,
 :
S:Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the Pope.
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :Winchester goose, I cry "a rope, a rope!"--
 :Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?--
 :Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.--
S:
 :Out, tawny coats, out, scarlet hypocrite!

S:MAYOR
 :
 :Fie, lords, that you, being supreme magistrates,
 :
 :Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
 :
 :
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Peace, Mayor? Thou know'st little of my wrongs.
 :
 :Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
 :
 :Hath here distrained the Tower to his use.
S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
 :
 :One that still motions war and never peace,
 :O'ercharging your free purses with large fines;
 :That seeks to overthrow religion
 :Because he is Protector of the realm,
 :And would have armor here out of the Tower
 :To crown himself king and suppress the Prince.
S:
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :I will not answer thee with words, but blows.

S:=======
 :
 :[Enter the Master Gunner of Orleance and his Boy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MASTER GUNNER
 :Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleance is besieged
 :And how the English have the suburbs won.
 :
S:BOY
 :
 :Father, I know, and oft have shot at them;
 :
S:Howe'er, unfortunate, I missed my aim.
 :
 :
 :
 :MASTER GUNNER
 :
 :But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me.
 :Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
 :Something I must do to procure me grace.
 :The Prince's espials have informed me
 :How the English, in the suburbs close entrenched,
 :Went through a secret grate of iron bars
S:
 :In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
 :
S:And thence discover how with most advantage
 :
 :They may vex us with shot or with assault.
 :
 :To intercept this inconvenience,
 :
 :A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed,
 :And even these three days have I watched
S:If I could see them. Now do thou watch,
 :
S:For I can stay no longer.
 :
 :If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
 :
S:And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Father, I warrant you, take you no care;
S:I'll never trouble you if I may spy them.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Salisbury and Talbot on the turrets,
 :
 :with Sir William Glansdale, Sir Thomas Gargrave,
 :Attendants and Others.]
 :
 :
 :SALISBURY
 :Talbot, my life, my joy, again returned!
S:
 :How wert thou handled, being prisoner?
 :
 :Or by what means gott'st thou to be released?
 :
 :Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
 :
 :
S:TALBOT
 :
 :The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
 :
 :Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
 :
 :For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
 :But with a baser man-of-arms by far
 :Once in contempt they would have bartered me,
 :Which I disdaining, scorned, and craved death
 :Rather than I would be so vile-esteemed.
 :In fine, redeemed I was as I desired.
S:
 :But O, the treacherous Fastolf wounds my heart,
 :
 :Whom with my bare fists I would execute
 :
 :If I now had him brought into my power.
 :
 :
 :SALISBURY
 :Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertained.
S:
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
 :
 :In open marketplace produced they me
 :To be a public spectacle to all.
 :"Here," said they, "is the terror of the French,
 :The scarecrow that affrights our children so."
 :Then broke I from the officers that led me,
S:And with my nails digged stones out of the ground
 :
 :To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
 :
 :My grisly countenance made others fly;
 :
 :None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
 :In iron walls they deemed me not secure:
 :So great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread
 :That they supposed I could rend bars of steel
 :And spurn in pieces posts of adamant.
 :Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
S:
S:That walked about me every minute-while;
 :
 :And if I did but stir out of my bed,
 :
 :Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
 :
 :
 :[Enter the Boy with a linstock.
 :He crosses the main stage and exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :SALISBURY
 :
 :I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
 :
S:But we will be revenged sufficiently.
 :
 :Now it is supper time in Orleance.
 :
 :Here, through this grate, I count each one
 :
 :And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.
 :Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
 :Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale,
S:Let me have your express opinions
 :
 :Where is best place to make our batt'ry next?
 :
 :
 :
 :GARGRAVE
 :I think at the north gate, for there stands lords.
 :
 :GLANSDALE
 :And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
 :
S:
 :TALBOT
 :
 :For aught I see, this city must be famished
 :
 :Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
 :
 :[Here they shoot, and Salisbury
 :and Gargrave fall down.]
 :
 :SALISBURY
S:O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
 :
 :
 :
 :GARGRAVE
 :
 :O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!
 :
 :TALBOT
S:What chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us?--
 :
 :Speak, Salisbury--at least if thou canst, speak!
 :
 :How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
 :
 :One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!--
 :Accursed tower, accursed fatal hand
 :That hath contrived this woeful tragedy!
 :In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
 :Henry the Fifth he first trained to the wars.
 :Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
S:
 :His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.--
 :
 :Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
 :
 :One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace.
 :
S:The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
 :
 :Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
 :
S:If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!--
 :
 :Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
 :
 :Speak unto Talbot. Nay, look up to him.--
 :
 :Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
 :[Attendants exit with body of Gargrave.]
 :Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
 :Thou shalt not die whiles--
 :He beckons with his hand and smiles on me
 :As who should say "When I am dead and gone,
S:
 :Remember to avenge me on the French."
 :
 :Plantagenet, I will; and, like thee, Nero,
 :
 :Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
 :
 :Wretched shall France be only in my name.
 :[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens.]
 :What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
S:Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
S:MESSENGER
 :
 :My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head.
 :
S:The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle joined,
 :
 :A holy prophetess new risen up,
 :
 :Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
 :
 :[Here Salisbury lifteth himself up and groans.]
 :
 :TALBOT
 :Hear, hear, how dying Salisbury doth groan;
 :It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
 :Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you.
S:
 :Pucelle or puzel, dauphin or dogfish,
 :
 :Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
 :
 :And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
 :
 :Convey we Salisbury into his tent,
 :And then try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
 :[Alarum. They exit.]

 :[Soldiers enter bearing the body of Salisbury,

 :
S:
S:Now have I paid my vow unto his soul:
 :
 :For every drop of blood was drawn from him
 :
 :There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
 :
 :And, that hereafter ages may behold
 :What ruin happened in revenge of him,
 :Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
 :A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred,
 :Upon the which, that everyone may read,
 :Shall be engraved the sack of Orleance,
S:
 :The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
 :
 :And what a terror he had been to France.
 :
 :[Funeral exits.]
 :
 :But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
 :I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,

S:Nor any of his false confederates.

 :
 :BEDFORD
 :
 :'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,

S:
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
 :Myself, as far as I could well discern
 :
 :For smoke and dusky vapors of the night,
 :Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
 :When arm-in-arm they both came swiftly running,
 :Like to a pair of loving turtledoves
 :That could not live asunder day or night.
 :After that things are set in order here,
S:
 :We'll follow them with all the power we have.

 :
S:
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
 :
 :With modesty admiring thy renown,
 :
 :By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
 :To visit her poor castle where she lies,
 :That she may boast she hath beheld the man
 :Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
S:
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
 :Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
 :
 :Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
 :When ladies crave to be encountered with.
 :You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
 :
 :TALBOT
 :Ne'er trust me, then; for when a world of men
S:
S:Could not prevail with all their oratory,
 :
 :Yet hath a woman's kindness overruled.--
 :
 :And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
 :
S:And in submission will attend on her.--

S:No, truly, 'tis more than manners will;

 :COUNTESS  Is this the scourge of France?
S:Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad
 :
 :That with his name the mothers still their babes?
 :
 :I see report is fabulous and false.

 :I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
 :A second Hector, for his grim aspect
 :And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
 :Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!

S:Should strike such terror to his enemies.

S:COUNTESS  To me, bloodthirsty lord.
 :
 :And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
 :
 :Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
 :
 :For in my gallery thy picture hangs.
 :But now the substance shall endure the like,
 :And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
 :That hast by tyranny these many years
 :Wasted our country, slain our citizens,
 :And sent our sons and husbands captivate.

S:COUNTESS  Why, art not thou the man?

 :
 :
 :TALBOT  I am, indeed.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Then have I substance too.
S:
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :No, no, I am but shadow of myself.
 :
S:You are deceived; my substance is not here,
 :
 :For what you see is but the smallest part
 :
 :And least proportion of humanity.
 :
 :I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
 :It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
 :Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.

S:This is a riddling merchant for the nonce:

 :How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded
S:
 :That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
 :
 :These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
 :
S:With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
 :
 :Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
 :
 :And in a moment makes them desolate.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse.
 :I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
 :And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
 :Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,

S:TALBOT
 :
 :Be not dismayed, fair lady, nor misconster

S:The mind of Talbot as you did mistake

 :PLANTAGENET
 :Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
 :Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
S:

 :
S:Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;

S:

 :
 :Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,
 :
 :Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,
 :
 :Between two blades, which bears the better temper,
 :Between two horses, which doth bear him best,
 :Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,
 :I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
 :But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
 :Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
S:
 :
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance!
 :
S:The truth appears so naked on my side
 :
 :That any purblind eye may find it out.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :And on my side it is so well appareled,
 :So clear, so shining, and so evident,
 :That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
 :
S:PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
 :
 :In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
 :
 :Let him that is a trueborn gentleman
 :And stands upon the honor of his birth,
 :If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
 :From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
 :
 :SOMERSET
S:
 :Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,

 :
 :Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.

 :I love no colors; and, without all color
 :Of base insinuating flattery,
S:I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
S:And say withal I think he held the right.
 :
 :
 :
 :VERNON

 :Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
 :Till you conclude that he upon whose side
 :The fewest roses are cropped from the tree
 :Shall yield the other in the right opinion.

S:SOMERSET

 :Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
 :
S:If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
 :
S:
 :
 :PLANTAGENET  And I.
 :
 :
 :
 :VERNON
 :Then for the truth and plainness of the case,
S:I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,

 :Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
S:Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,
 :
 :And fall on my side so against your will.
 :
 :
 :
 :VERNON
 :If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
 :Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
 :And keep me on the side where still I am.
S:
 :
 :SOMERSET  Well, well, come on, who else?
 :
 :
 :
 :LAWYER
 :Unless my study and my books be false,
 :The argument you held was wrong in law,
 :In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
 :
S:PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
 :
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :Here in my scabbard, meditating that
 :Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
S:Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,
 :
 :For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
 :
 :The truth on our side.
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET  No, Plantagenet.
 :'Tis not for fear, but anger that thy cheeks
 :Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
 :And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.

S:
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
 :
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
S:Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,
 :
 :Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
 :That shall maintain what I have said is true,
 :Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.

S:PLANTAGENET

 :Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
 :
 :I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.

 :Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.

 :PLANTAGENET
 :Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.

 :Away, away, good William de la Pole!

S:Third son to the third Edward, King of England.
 :
S:Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?

 :He bears him on the place's privilege,
 :Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
 :On any plot of ground in Christendom.
S:
S:Was not thy father Richard, Earl of Cambridge,
 :
 :For treason executed in our late king's days?
 :
 :And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
 :
 :Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
 :His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,
 :And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :My father was attached, not attainted,
S:
 :Condemned to die for treason, but no traitor;
 :
 :And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,

 :For your partaker Pole and you yourself,

 :Look to it well, and say you are well warned.

S:

 :Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,

 :And know us by these colors for thy foes,

 :For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
S:
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,

 :
 :
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
 :Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
S:Even like a man new-haled from the rack,
 :
 :So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
 :
 :And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,
 :
 :Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
S:Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer;
 :
 :These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
 :
 :Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
 :
 :Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
 :And pithless arms, like to a withered vine
 :That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
 :Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
 :Unable to support this lump of clay,
S:Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
 :
 :As witting I no other comfort have.
 :
 :But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
 :Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.
 :We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,
 :And answer was returned that he will come.
 :
S:
 :MORTIMER
 :
 :Enough. My soul shall then be satisfied.
 :
 :Poor gentleman, his wrong doth equal mine.
 :
S:Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
 :
 :Before whose glory I was great in arms,
 :
 :This loathsome sequestration have I had;
 :
S:And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
 :
 :Deprived of honor and inheritance.
 :
 :But now the arbitrator of despairs,
 :
 :Just Death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
 :With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.
 :I would his troubles likewise were expired,
 :That so he might recover what was lost.
 :
 :[Enter Richard Plantagenet.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
 :
 :My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
 :
S:
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
 :
 :Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
 :
 :
 :MORTIMER, [to Jailer]
 :Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
 :And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.
 :O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
S:
 :That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
 :
 :[He embraces Richard.]
 :
 :And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
 :
S:Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised?
 :
 :
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,
 :And in that ease I'll tell thee my disease.
S:This day, in argument upon a case,
 :
 :Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me,
 :
 :Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
 :
 :And did upbraid me with my father's death;
 :Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
 :Else with the like I had requited him.
 :Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
 :In honor of a true Plantagenet,
 :And for alliance' sake, declare the cause
S:
 :My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
 :
 :
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :
 :That cause, fair nephew, that imprisoned me
 :And hath detained me all my flow'ring youth
 :Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
 :Was cursed instrument of his decease.
 :
S:
S:PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Discover more at large what cause that was,
 :
 :For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
 :
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :I will, if that my fading breath permit
 :And death approach not ere my tale be done.
S:Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
 :
 :Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
 :
 :The first begotten and the lawful heir
 :
 :Of Edward king, the third of that descent;
 :During whose reign the Percies of the north,
 :Finding his usurpation most unjust,
 :Endeavored my advancement to the throne.
 :The reason moved these warlike lords to this
 :Was, for that--young Richard thus removed,
S:
S:Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
 :
 :I was the next by birth and parentage;
 :
 :For by my mother I derived am
 :
 :From Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third son
 :To King Edward the Third; whereas he
 :From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
S:Being but fourth of that heroic line.
 :
 :But mark: as in this haughty great attempt
 :
 :They labored to plant the rightful heir,
 :
 :I lost my liberty and they their lives.
 :Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
 :Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
 :Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, derived
 :From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
 :Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
S:
 :Again, in pity of my hard distress,
 :
 :Levied an army, weening to redeem
 :
 :And have installed me in the diadem.
 :
 :But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
 :And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
 :In whom the title rested, were suppressed.
S:
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Of which, my lord, your Honor is the last.
 :
 :
S:MORTIMER
 :
 :True, and thou seest that I no issue have
 :
S:And that my fainting words do warrant death.
 :
 :Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather.
 :
 :But yet be wary in thy studious care.
 :
 :
S:PLANTAGENET
 :
 :Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
 :
 :But yet methinks my father's execution
 :
 :Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :With silence, nephew, be thou politic;
 :Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
 :And, like a mountain, not to be removed.
S:
 :But now thy uncle is removing hence,
 :
 :As princes do their courts when they are cloyed
 :
 :With long continuance in a settled place.
 :
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :O uncle, would some part of my young years
 :Might but redeem the passage of your age.
S:
 :
 :MORTIMER
 :
 :Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
 :
 :Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
S:Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
 :
 :Only give order for my funeral.
 :
 :And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,
 :
S:And prosperous be thy life in peace and war.
 :
 :[Dies.]
 :
S:
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :
 :And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul.
 :
 :In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,
 :And like a hermit overpassed thy days.--
S:Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,
 :
 :And what I do imagine, let that rest.--
 :
 :Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
 :
 :Will see his burial better than his life.
 :[Jailers exit carrying Mortimer's body.]

 :Choked with ambition of the meaner sort.
 :And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
 :Which Somerset hath offered to my house,
S:
 :I doubt not but with honor to redress.

S:And therefore haste I to the Parliament,

 :=======
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Exeter, Gloucester, and
 :
 :Winchester; Richard Plantagenet and Warwick,
 :with white roses; Somerset and Suffolk, with red
 :roses; and Others. Gloucester offers to put up a bill.
S:Winchester snatches it, tears it.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,
 :With written pamphlets studiously devised?
 :Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse
 :Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
 :Do it without invention, suddenly,
 :As I with sudden and extemporal speech
S:
 :Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Presumptuous priest, this place commands my
 :patience,
 :Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonored me.
 :Think not, although in writing I preferred
 :The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
S:
 :That therefore I have forged or am not able
 :
 :Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen.
 :
 :No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,
 :
 :Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks,
 :As very infants prattle of thy pride.
 :Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
 :Froward by nature, enemy to peace,
 :Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
S:
 :A man of thy profession and degree.
 :
 :And for thy treachery, what's more manifest,
 :
 :In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
 :
 :As well at London Bridge as at the Tower?
 :Besides, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
S:The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
 :
 :From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
 :
S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :Gloucester, I do defy thee.--Lords, vouchsafe
 :
 :To give me hearing what I shall reply.
 :If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,
 :As he will have me, how am I so poor?
 :Or how haps it I seek not to advance
 :Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
S:And for dissension, who preferreth peace
 :
 :More than I do, except I be provoked?
 :
 :No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
 :
 :It is not that that hath incensed the Duke.
S:It is because no one should sway but he,
 :
 :No one but he should be about the King;
 :
 :And that engenders thunder in his breast
 :
 :And makes him roar these accusations forth.
S:But he shall know I am as good--
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER  As good!
 :
 :Thou bastard of my grandfather!
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
 :But one imperious in another's throne?
 :
S:
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Am I not Protector, saucy priest?
 :
 :
 :
S:WINCHESTER
 :
 :And am not I a prelate of the Church?
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps,
 :And useth it to patronage his theft.
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :Unreverent Gloucester!
S:
S:
 :
 :GLOUCESTER  Thou art reverend
 :
 :Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
 :
S:
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :Rome shall remedy this.
 :
S:
 :
 :GLOUCESTER  Roam thither then.
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK, [to Winchester]
S:My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
 :
S:
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :
 :Ay, so the Bishop be not overborne.
 :
 :Methinks my lord should be religious,
S:And know the office that belongs to such.
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK
 :
 :Methinks his Lordship should be humbler.
 :It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
 :
 :SOMERSET
 :Yes, when his holy state is touched so near.
 :
S:
 :WARWICK
 :
S:State holy, or unhallowed, what of that?
 :
 :Is not his Grace Protector to the King?
 :
S:
 :
 :PLANTAGENET, [aside]
 :
 :Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
 :
 :Lest it be said "Speak, sirrah, when you should;
 :Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?"
 :Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
S:Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
 :
 :The special watchmen of our English weal,
 :
S:I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
 :
 :To join your hearts in love and amity.
 :
 :O, what a scandal is it to our crown
 :
 :That two such noble peers as you should jar!
 :Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
 :Civil dissension is a viperous worm
 :That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
 :
 :[A noise within: "Down with the tawny coats!"]
S:
 :What tumult 's this?
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK  An uproar, I dare warrant,
 :
 :Begun through malice of the Bishop's men.
 :[A noise again: "Stones! Stones!"]
S:
 :
 :[Enter Mayor.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:MAYOR
 :
 :O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
 :
 :Pity the city of London, pity us!
 :
 :The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
S:Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
 :
 :Have filled their pockets full of pebble stones
 :
 :And, banding themselves in contrary parts,
 :
 :Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
 :That many have their giddy brains knocked out;
 :Our windows are broke down in every street,
 :And we, for fear, compelled to shut our shops.
 :
 :[Enter Servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
 :To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace.--
 :Pray, Uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.
 :
S:FIRST SERVINGMAN  Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we'll
 :
 :fall to it with our teeth.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND SERVINGMAN
 :Do what you dare, we are as
 :resolute.	[Skirmish again.]
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :You of my household, leave this peevish broil,
S:
 :And set this unaccustomed fight aside.
 :
S:
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN
 :
S:My lord, we know your Grace to be a man
 :
 :Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,
 :
 :Inferior to none but to his Majesty;
 :
 :And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
S:So kind a father of the commonweal,
 :
S:To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
 :
 :We and our wives and children all will fight
 :
 :And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
 :Ay, and the very parings of our nails
 :Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
 :[Begin again.]
 :
S:
 :GLOUCESTER  Stay, stay, I say!
 :
 :And if you love me, as you say you do,
 :
S:Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY
 :
 :O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
 :
S:Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
 :
 :My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?
 :
 :Who should be pitiful if you be not?
 :
 :Or who should study to prefer a peace
 :If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
 :
 :WARWICK
 :Yield, my Lord Protector--yield, Winchester--
S:Except you mean with obstinate repulse
 :
 :To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
 :
 :You see what mischief, and what murder too,
 :
 :Hath been enacted through your enmity.
 :Then be at peace, except you thirst for blood.
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :He shall submit, or I will never yield.
 :
S:
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Compassion on the King commands me stoop,
 :
 :Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
 :
 :Should ever get that privilege of me.
 :
S:WARWICK
 :
 :Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke
 :
 :Hath banished moody discontented fury,
 :
 :As by his smoothed brows it doth appear.
 :Why look you still so stern and tragical?
 :
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
 :
 :[Winchester refuses Gloucester's hand.]
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY
 :
 :Fie, Uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
 :
 :That malice was a great and grievous sin;
 :
S:And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
 :
 :But prove a chief offender in the same?
 :
 :
 :
S:WARWICK
 :
 :Sweet king! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.--
 :
 :For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent;
 :
 :What, shall a child instruct you what to do?
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
 :Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
 :[They take each other's hand.]
S:
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER, [aside]
 :
 :Ay, but I fear me with a hollow heart.--
 :
 :See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
 :This token serveth for a flag of truce
S:Betwixt ourselves and all our followers,
 :
 :So help me God, as I dissemble not.
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER, [aside]
 :So help me God, as I intend it not.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :O, loving uncle--kind Duke of Gloucester--
 :How joyful am I made by this contract.
S:
 :[To the Servingmen.] Away, my masters, trouble us
 :
 :no more,
 :
S:But join in friendship as your lords have done.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN  Content. I'll to the surgeon's.
 :
 :
 :SECOND SERVINGMAN  And so will I.
S:
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN  And I will see what physic the tavern
 :
S:affords.
 :
 :[They exit with Mayor and Others.]
 :
 :
 :
S:WARWICK, [presenting a scroll]
 :
 :Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
 :
 :Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
 :
S:We do exhibit to your Majesty.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Well urged, my Lord of Warwick.--For, sweet prince,
 :An if your Grace mark every circumstance,
 :You have great reason to do Richard right,
 :Especially for those occasions
S:At Eltham Place I told your Majesty.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :And those occasions, uncle, were of force.--
 :Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
 :That Richard be restored to his blood.
 :
 :WARWICK
 :Let Richard be restored to his blood;
S:
 :So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :
 :As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:If Richard will be true, not that alone
 :
 :But all the whole inheritance I give
 :
S:That doth belong unto the house of York,
 :
 :From whence you spring by lineal descent.
 :
 :
 :
 :PLANTAGENET
 :Thy humble servant vows obedience
 :And humble service till the point of death.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Stoop then, and set your knee against my foot;
S:
 :[Plantagenet kneels.]
 :
 :And in reguerdon of that duty done
 :
 :I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.
 :
 :Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
 :And rise created princely Duke of York.
 :
 :YORK, [formerly PLANTAGENET, standing]
 :And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
S:
 :And as my duty springs, so perish they
 :
S:That grudge one thought against your Majesty.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL
 :
 :Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York.
 :
 :SOMERSET, [aside]
S:Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Now will it best avail your Majesty
 :To cross the seas and to be crowned in France.
 :The presence of a king engenders love
 :Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
 :As it disanimates his enemies.
 :
S:
S:KING HENRY
 :
 :When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,
 :
 :For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
 :
S:
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
S:Your ships already are in readiness.
 :
S:[Sennet. Flourish. All but Exeter exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER
 :
 :Ay, we may march in England or in France,
 :Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
 :This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
 :Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
 :And will at last break out into a flame.
 :As festered members rot but by degree
S:
S:Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
 :
 :So will this base and envious discord breed.
 :
 :And now I fear that fatal prophecy
 :
S:Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
 :
 :Was in the mouth of every sucking babe:
 :
S:That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,
 :
 :And Henry born at Windsor should lose all,
 :
 :Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
 :
S:His days may finish ere that hapless time.

S:[Enter Pucelle disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks
 :
 :upon their backs.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :These are the city gates, the gates of Roan,
 :
 :Through which our policy must make a breach.
 :Take heed. Be wary how you place your words;
 :Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
 :That come to gather money for their corn.
 :If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
 :And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
S:
 :I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
 :
 :That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOLDIER
 :Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
S:And we be lords and rulers over Roan;

S:[Knock.]

S:and Soldiers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :Saint Dennis bless this happy stratagem
 :And once again we'll sleep secure in Roan.
 :
 :BASTARD
 :Here entered Pucelle and her practisants.
S:
S:Now she is there, how will she specify
 :
 :"Here is the best and safest passage in"?
 :
 :
 :
S:REIGNIER
 :
 :By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,
 :
 :Which, once discerned, shows that her meaning is:
 :
 :No way to that, for weakness, which she entered.
 :
 :[Enter Pucelle on the top, thrusting out a torch burning.]
 :
 :
S:PUCELLE
 :
 :Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
 :
 :That joineth Roan unto her countrymen,
 :
 :But burning fatal to the Talbonites.
 :
 :BASTARD
 :See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
 :The burning torch, in yonder turret stands.
S:
 :
 :CHARLES
 :
 :Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
 :
 :A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :Defer no time; delays have dangerous ends.
S:Enter and cry "The Dauphin!" presently,
 :
 :And then do execution on the watch.
 :
 :[Alarum. They exit.]
 :
 :
 :[An Alarum. Enter Talbot in an excursion.]
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
S:
 :If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
 :
 :Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
 :
 :Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
 :
 :That hardly we escaped the pride of France.

 :on the walls.]
 :
 :
S:

S:PUCELLE, [to those below]
 :
 :Good morrow, gallants. Want you corn for bread?
 :
 :[She scatters grain on those below.]
 :
S:I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
 :
 :Before he'll buy again at such a rate.
 :
 :'Twas full of darnel. Do you like the taste?
 :
S:
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
 :Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtesan!
 :
S:I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,

 :Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.

S:BEDFORD
 :
 :O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason.
 :
 :

 :And run a-tilt at Death within a chair?
 :
 :TALBOT
S:Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,
 :
 :Encompassed with thy lustful paramours,
 :
 :Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
 :
 :And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
 :Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
 :Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Are you so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,
S:
 :If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
 :
 :[Those below whisper together in council.]
 :
S:God speed the Parliament! Who shall be the Speaker?
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :Dare you come forth and meet us in the field?
 :
 :PUCELLE
S:Belike your Lordship takes us then for fools,
 :
 :To try if that our own be ours or no.
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :I speak not to that railing Hecate,
S:But unto thee, Alanson, and the rest.
 :
 :Will you, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
 :
S:
 :
 :ALANSON  Seigneur, no.
 :

S:Seigneur, hang! Base muleteers of France,

 :And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Away, captains. Let's get us from the walls,
 :For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.--
 :Goodbye, my lord. We came but to tell you
 :That we are here.	[They exit from the walls.]
S:
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
S:And there will we be too, ere it be long,
 :
S:Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame.--
 :
 :Vow, Burgundy, by honor of thy house,
 :
 :Pricked on by public wrongs sustained in France,
 :
 :Either to get the town again or die.
 :And I, as sure as English Henry lives,
 :And as his father here was conqueror,
S:As sure as in this late-betrayed town
 :
 :Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,
 :
 :So sure I swear to get the town or die.
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
 :
S:TALBOT
 :
 :But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
 :
 :The valiant Duke of Bedford.--Come, my lord,
 :
 :We will bestow you in some better place,
 :Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :Lord Talbot, do not so dishonor me.
 :Here will I sit, before the walls of Roan,
S:
 :And will be partner of your weal or woe.
 :
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
 :Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you--
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :Not to be gone from hence, for once I read
 :That stout Pendragon, in his litter sick,
S:
 :Came to the field and vanquished his foes.
 :
 :Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts
 :
S:Because I ever found them as myself.
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :Undaunted spirit in a dying breast,
S:Then be it so. Heavens keep old Bedford safe!--
 :
S:And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
 :
 :But gather we our forces out of hand
 :
 :And set upon our boasting enemy.
 :
S:[He exits with Burgundy.
 :
 :Bedford and Attendants remain.]

S:

 :
 :and a Captain.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :Whither away, Sir John Fastolf, in such haste?
 :
 :FASTOLF
S:
 :Whither away? To save myself by flight.

 :
S:CAPTAIN
 :
S:What, will you fly and leave Lord Talbot?

 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BEDFORD
 :Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
 :For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
S:What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
 :
 :They that of late were daring with their scoffs
 :
 :Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
 :
 :[Bedford dies, and is carried
S:in by two in his chair.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[An alarum. Enter Talbot, Burgundy, and the rest.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :Lost and recovered in a day again!
 :This is a double honor, Burgundy.
S:Yet heavens have glory for this victory.
 :
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
S:Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
 :
S:Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
 :
 :Thy noble deeds as valor's monuments.
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
S:Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
 :
 :I think her old familiar is asleep.
 :
 :Now where's the Bastard's braves and Charles his
 :
 :gleeks?
 :What, all amort? Roan hangs her head for grief
 :That such a valiant company are fled.
 :Now will we take some order in the town,
 :Placing therein some expert officers,
 :And then depart to Paris to the King,
S:
 :For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
 :
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY
 :
 :What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
 :
 :TALBOT
 :But yet, before we go, let's not forget
 :The noble Duke of Bedford late-deceased,
S:
 :But see his exequies fulfilled in Roan.
 :
 :A braver soldier never couched lance,
 :
 :A gentler heart did never sway in court.
 :
 :But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
 :For that's the end of human misery.

 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
 :
 :Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered.
S:Care is no cure, but rather corrosive
 :
 :For things that are not to be remedied.
 :
 :Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,

 :If dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.

S:We have been guided by thee hitherto,

S:

 :

 :Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
 :And see the cities and the towns defaced
S:By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
 :
 :As looks the mother on her lowly babe
 :
 :When death doth close his tender-dying eyes,
 :
 :See, see the pining malady of France:
S:Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
 :
 :Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.
 :
 :O, turn thy edged sword another way;
 :
 :Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
S:One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
 :
 :Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore.
 :
 :Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
 :
 :And wash away thy country's stained spots.
 :
 :BURGUNDY, [aside]
 :Either she hath bewitched me with her words,
 :Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
 :
S:
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
 :
 :Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
 :
S:Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation
 :
 :That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
 :
 :When Talbot hath set footing once in France
 :
 :And fashioned thee that instrument of ill,
 :Who then but English Henry will be lord,
 :And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
 :Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof:
 :Was not the Duke of Orleance thy foe?
S:And was he not in England prisoner?
 :
 :But when they heard he was thine enemy,
 :
 :They set him free, without his ransom paid,
 :
 :In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
 :See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen,
 :And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
 :Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord.
 :Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.

S:

S:And made me almost yield upon my knees.--

S:God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!

 :FASTOLF
 :My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice
 :To haste unto your coronation,
 :A letter was delivered to my hands,
 :Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy.
S:
 :[He hands the King a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
 :I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
 :To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg,
 :[tearing it off]
 :Which I have done, because unworthily
S:
 :Thou wast installed in that high degree.--
 :
 :Pardon me, princely Henry and the rest.
 :
 :This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
 :
 :When but in all I was six thousand strong
 :And that the French were almost ten to one,
 :Before we met or that a stroke was given,
S:Like to a trusty squire did run away;
 :
 :In which assault we lost twelve hundred men.
 :
S:Myself and divers gentlemen besides
 :
 :Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
 :
 :Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,
 :
 :Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
 :This ornament of knighthood--yea or no?
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :To say the truth, this fact was infamous
 :And ill beseeming any common man,
S:
 :Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :When first this Order was ordained, my lords,
 :Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,
 :Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
 :Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
 :Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,
S:
 :But always resolute in most extremes.
 :
S:He then that is not furnished in this sort
 :
 :Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
 :
 :Profaning this most honorable Order,
 :
 :And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
S:Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
 :
 :That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY, [to Fastolf]
 :
 :Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom.
 :
 :Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight.
 :Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.
 :[Fastolf exits.]
S:And now, my lord protector, view the letter
 :
 :Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy.
 :
 :[He hands the paper to Gloucester.]
 :
 :
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :What means his Grace that he hath changed his style?
 :
 :No more but, plain and bluntly, "To the King"!
 :
 :Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
 :Or doth this churlish superscription
 :Pretend some alteration in good will?
 :What's here? [(Reads.)]
 :I have upon especial cause,
 :Moved with compassion of my country's wrack,
S:
 :Together with the pitiful complaints
 :
 :Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
 :
S:Forsaken your pernicious faction
 :
 :And joined with Charles, the rightful king of France.
 :
 :O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?
 :
 :That in alliance, amity, and oaths
 :There should be found such false dissembling guile?
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :What? Doth my Uncle Burgundy revolt?
 :
S:
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
 :
 :And give him chastisement for this abuse.--
 :
 :How say you, my lord, are you not content?
 :
 :TALBOT
 :Content, my liege? Yes. But that I am prevented,
 :I should have begged I might have been employed.
S:
 :
 :

 :
 :Then gather strength and march unto him straight;
 :
 :Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
 :And what offense it is to flout his friends.
 :

S:
 :You may behold confusion of your foes.	[He exits.]

S:
S:Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,
 :
S:And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?
 :
 :
 :
 :VERNON
 :
 :With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.
 :

S:And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
 :First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
 :
 :BASSET
 :Crossing the sea from England into France,
 :This fellow here with envious carping tongue
S:
 :Upbraided me about the rose I wear,
 :
 :Saying the sanguine color of the leaves
 :
 :Did represent my master's blushing cheeks
 :
 :When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
 :About a certain question in the law
 :Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,
 :With other vile and ignominious terms.
S:In confutation of which rude reproach,
 :
 :And in defense of my lord's worthiness,
 :
 :I crave the benefit of law of arms.
 :
 :
 :VERNON
 :And that is my petition, noble lord;
 :For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
 :To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
 :Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,
S:
 :And he first took exceptions at this badge,
 :
 :Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
 :
 :Bewrayed the faintness of my master's heart.
 :
 :
S:YORK
 :
 :Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
 :
 :
 :
S:SOMERSET
 :
 :Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,

 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men
 :
S:When for so slight and frivolous a cause
 :
 :Such factious emulations shall arise!
 :
 :Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
 :
 :Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
 :
 :YORK
 :Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
 :And then your Highness shall command a peace.
 :
S:
S:SOMERSET
 :
 :The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
 :
 :Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
 :
 :

 :There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
 :

 :Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
S:

 :BASSET, [to Somerset]
 :
 :Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.
 :
 :
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,
 :
 :And perish you with your audacious prate!
 :
 :Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed
 :With this immodest clamorous outrage
 :To trouble and disturb the King and us?--
 :And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
 :To bear with their perverse objections,
S:Much less to take occasion from their mouths
 :
 :To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.
 :
 :Let me persuade you take a better course.
 :
 :
 :EXETER
 :It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Come hither, you that would be combatants:
S:
 :Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,
 :
 :Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.--
 :
S:And you, my lords, remember where we are:
 :
S:In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation.
 :
 :If they perceive dissension in our looks,
 :
 :And that within ourselves we disagree,
 :
 :How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
S:To willful disobedience and rebel!
 :
 :Besides, what infamy will there arise
 :
S:When foreign princes shall be certified
 :
 :That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
 :
 :King Henry's peers and chief nobility
 :
 :Destroyed themselves and lost the realm of France!
 :O, think upon the conquest of my father,
 :My tender years, and let us not forgo
S:That for a trifle that was bought with blood.
 :
 :Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
 :
 :I see no reason if I wear this rose
 :
 :That anyone should therefore be suspicious
 :I more incline to Somerset than York.
 :[He puts on a red rose.]
 :Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
 :As well they may upbraid me with my crown
 :Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crowned.
S:
 :But your discretions better can persuade
 :
 :Than I am able to instruct or teach;
 :
 :And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
 :
 :So let us still continue peace and love.
 :Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
 :To be our regent in these parts of France;--
 :And good my Lord of Somerset, unite
 :Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
S:
S:And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
 :
S:Go cheerfully together and digest
 :
 :Your angry choler on your enemies.
 :
S:Ourself, my lord protector, and the rest,
 :
 :After some respite, will return to Callice;
 :
S:From thence to England, where I hope ere long
 :
 :To be presented, by your victories,
 :
 :With Charles, Alanson, and that traitorous rout.
 :

S:WARWICK
 :
S:My Lord of York, I promise you the King
 :
 :Prettily, methought, did play the orator.

S:And so he did, but yet I like it not
 :
 :In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
 :
 :
 :

 :Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not.
S:I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.

 :Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,
 :For had the passions of thy heart burst out,

 :More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
S:
 :Than yet can be imagined or supposed.

 :But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
 :
 :This jarring discord of nobility,
 :
 :This shouldering of each other in the court,
 :This factious bandying of their favorites,
 :But sees it doth presage some ill event.
 :'Tis much when scepters are in children's hands,
 :But more when envy breeds unkind division:

S:If we be English deer, be then in blood,

 :SOMERSET
 :It is too late; I cannot send them now.
 :This expedition was by York and Talbot
 :Too rashly plotted. All our general force
 :Might with a sally of the very town
S:
 :Be buckled with. The overdaring Talbot
 :
 :Hath sullied all his gloss of former honor
 :
 :By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.

S:Cries out for noble York and Somerset
 :
 :To beat assailing Death from his weak regions;
 :
 :And whiles the honorable captain there
 :
 :Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
 :And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
 :You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honor,
 :Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
 :Let not your private discord keep away

S:
 :While he, renowned noble gentleman,

 :Yield up his life unto a world of odds.

 :[Enter Talbot and John Talbot, his son.]
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :O young John Talbot, I did send for thee
S:
 :To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
 :
 :That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
 :
 :When sapless age and weak unable limbs
 :
S:Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
 :
 :But--O, malignant and ill-boding stars!--
 :
 :Now thou art come unto a feast of Death,
 :
 :A terrible and unavoided danger.
 :Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
 :And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
 :By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone.
 :
 :JOHN TALBOT
S:
 :Is my name Talbot? And am I your son?
 :
 :And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,
 :
 :Dishonor not her honorable name
 :
S:To make a bastard and a slave of me!
 :
 :The world will say "He is not Talbot's blood,
 :
 :That basely fled when noble Talbot stood."

 :TALBOT
 :Fly, to revenge my death if I be slain.
S:

 :JOHN TALBOT
 :
S:He that flies so will ne'er return again.
 :
 :
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
 :
 :JOHN TALBOT
 :Then let me stay and, father, do you fly.
 :Your loss is great; so your regard should be.
 :My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
S:
 :Upon my death, the French can little boast;
 :
S:In yours they will; in you all hopes are lost.
 :
 :Flight cannot stain the honor you have won,
 :
 :But mine it will, that no exploit have done.
 :
 :You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;
 :But if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
 :There is no hope that ever I will stay
S:If the first hour I shrink and run away.	[He kneels.]
 :
 :Here on my knee I beg mortality,
 :
 :Rather than life preserved with infamy.
 :
S:
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
 :
 :
 :JOHN TALBOT
S:Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.

S:TALBOT
 :
 :Upon my blessing I command thee go.

 :To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.

 :No more can I be severed from your side

 :Than can yourself yourself in twain divide.
 :Stay, go, do what you will; the like do I,
 :For live I will not, if my father die.

 :Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,

 :
S:
 :
 :TALBOT
 :
 :Saint George, and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight!
 :
 :The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word
 :And left us to the rage of France his sword.
S:Where is John Talbot?--Pause, and take thy breath;
 :
 :I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
 :
 :
 :
 :JOHN TALBOT
 :O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
 :The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done
 :Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate,
 :To my determined time thou gav'st new date.
 :
S:
 :TALBOT
 :
S:When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
 :
 :It warmed thy father's heart with proud desire
 :
 :Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
 :
 :Quickened with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
 :Beat down Alanson, Orleance, Burgundy,
 :And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
 :The ireful Bastard Orleance, that drew blood
 :From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
 :Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
S:
 :And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
 :
 :Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace
 :
 :Bespoke him thus: "Contaminated, base,
 :
 :And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
 :Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
 :Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy."
 :Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
 :Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care:
S:
 :Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
 :
 :Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
 :
 :Now thou art sealed the son of chivalry?
 :
S:Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;
 :
 :The help of one stands me in little stead.
 :
S:O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
 :
 :To hazard all our lives in one small boat.
 :
 :If I today die not with Frenchmen's rage,
 :
 :Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age.
 :By me they nothing gain, and, if I stay,
 :'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
 :In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
 :My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.
 :All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
S:
 :All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.
 :
 :
 :
 :JOHN TALBOT
 :
 :The sword of Orleance hath not made me smart;
 :These words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart.
 :On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
 :To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
 :Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
S:
 :The coward horse that bears me fall and die!
 :
S:And like me to the peasant boys of France,
 :
 :To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
 :
 :Surely, by all the glory you have won,
 :
 :An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son.
 :Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
 :If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
 :
 :TALBOT
 :Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete,
S:
 :Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet.
 :
 :If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side,
 :
 :And commendable proved, let's die in pride.

S:Tend'ring my ruin and assailed of none,

S:O, thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death,

 :
 :Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.--
 :Poor boy, he smiles, methinks, as who should say

 :As if with Circe she would change my shape.
 :
S:
 :PUCELLE
 :
S:Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;
 :No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee,
 :And may you both be suddenly surprised
S:
 :By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds!
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :Fell banning hag! Enchantress, hold thy tongue.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.
 :
S:
S:YORK
 :
 :Curse, miscreant, when thou com'st to the stake.
 :
 :[They exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :[Alarum. Enter Suffolk with Margaret in his hand.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK
 :
 :Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
 :
 :[Gazes on her.]
 :
 :O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly,
 :For I will touch thee but with reverent hands.
 :I kiss these fingers for eternal peace
 :And lay them gently on thy tender side.
S:Who art thou? Say, that I may honor thee.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARGARET
 :
 :Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
 :
 :The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
S:
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
S:An earl I am, and Suffolk am I called.
 :
 :Be not offended, nature's miracle;
 :
S:Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me.
 :
 :So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
 :
 :Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.
 :
S:Yet if this servile usage once offend,
 :
 :Go and be free again as Suffolk's friend.
 :
 :[She is going.]
 :
 :O, stay! [(Aside.)] I have no power to let her pass.
 :My hand would free her, but my heart says no.
S:As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
 :
 :Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
 :
S:So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
 :
 :Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak.
 :
 :I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind.
 :
 :Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself!
 :Hast not a tongue? Is she not here?
 :Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
 :Ay. Beauty's princely majesty is such
 :Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
 :
S:
 :MARGARET
 :
 :Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,
 :
 :What ransom must I pay before I pass?
 :
 :For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
 :Before thou make a trial of her love?
S:
 :
 :
 :MARGARET
 :
 :Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I pay?
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :She's beautiful, and therefore to be wooed;
 :She is a woman, therefore to be won.
 :
S:
 :MARGARET
 :
S:Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :
 :Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;
 :Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
 :
 :MARGARET, [aside]
 :I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
 :
S:
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :
 :There all is marred; there lies a cooling card.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARGARET, [aside]
 :He talks at random; sure the man is mad.
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
S:And yet a dispensation may be had.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARGARET
 :
 :And yet I would that you would answer me.
S:
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :
 :I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
 :
 :Why, for my king. Tush, that's a wooden thing!
S:
 :
 :MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :
 :Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
 :
 :And peace established between these realms.
 :
 :But there remains a scruple in that, too;
S:For though her father be the King of Naples,
 :
 :Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
 :
 :And our nobility will scorn the match.
 :
 :
 :MARGARET
 :Hear you, captain? Are you not at leisure?
S:
 :
 :SUFFOLK, [aside]
 :
 :It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
 :
 :Henry is youthful, and will quickly yield.--
 :Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
 :
S:MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :What though I be enthralled, he seems a knight,
 :
S:And will not any way dishonor me.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
 :
 :MARGARET, [aside]
 :Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,
 :And then I need not crave his courtesy.
S:
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
S:Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :Lady, wherefore talk you so?
 :
 :MARGARET
S:
 :I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
 :Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
 :
 :MARGARET
 :To be a queen in bondage is more vile
S:
 :Than is a slave in base servility,
 :
 :For princes should be free.
 :
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK  And so shall you,
 :
 :If happy England's royal king be free.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARGARET
 :Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
 :To put a golden scepter in thy hand
S:
 :And set a precious crown upon thy head,
 :
 :If thou wilt condescend to be my--
 :
 :
 :
S:MARGARET  What?
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK  His love.
 :
 :
S:MARGARET
 :
 :I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :No, gentle madam, I unworthy am
 :To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,
 :And have no portion in the choice myself.
 :How say you, madam? Are you so content?
 :
S:
 :MARGARET
 :
 :An if my father please, I am content.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :Then call our captains and our colors forth!
 :[A Soldier exits.]
 :And, madam, at your father's castle walls
S:We'll crave a parley to confer with him.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Captains and Trumpets. Sound a parley.]
 :
 :[Enter Reignier on the walls.]
 :
 :See, Reignier, see thy daughter prisoner!
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :To whom?
S:
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK  To me.
 :
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER  Suffolk, what remedy?
 :I am a soldier and unapt to weep
S:Or to exclaim on Fortune's fickleness.
 :
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK
 :
 :Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:
 :
 :Consent, and, for thy Honor give consent,
 :
 :Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
 :Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;
 :And this her easy-held imprisonment
 :Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
 :
 :REIGNIER
S:
 :Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
 :
S:
 :
 :SUFFOLK  Fair Margaret knows
 :
S:That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.
 :
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :
S:Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
 :
S:To give thee answer of thy just demand.
 :
 :[He exits from the walls.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
S:And here I will expect thy coming.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Trumpets sound. Enter Reignier, below.]
 :
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :Welcome, brave earl, into our territories.
 :Command in Anjou what your Honor pleases.
 :
S:
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
 :
 :Fit to be made companion with a king.
 :
 :What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
 :To be the princely bride of such a lord,
S:
 :Upon condition I may quietly
 :
 :Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
 :
 :Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
 :
S:My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :That is her ransom; I deliver her,
 :And those two counties I will undertake
 :Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
S:
 :
 :REIGNIER
 :
S:And I, again in Henry's royal name
 :
 :As deputy unto that gracious king,
 :
S:Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith.
 :
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK
 :
 :Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks
 :
 :Because this is in traffic of a king.
 :
 :[Aside.] And yet methinks I could be well content
 :To be mine own attorney in this case.--
 :I'll over then to England with this news,
 :And make this marriage to be solemnized.
 :So farewell, Reignier; set this diamond safe
 :In golden palaces, as it becomes.
S:
 :
 :
 :REIGNIER, [embracing Suffolk]
 :
 :I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
 :
S:The Christian prince King Henry, were he here.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARGARET, [to Suffolk]
 :
 :Farewell, my lord; good wishes, praise, and prayers
 :
 :Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
S:[She is going, as Reignier exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Farewell, sweet madam. But, hark you, Margaret,
 :No princely commendations to my king?
 :
 :MARGARET
 :Such commendations as becomes a maid,
 :A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
S:
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
 :
 :But, madam, I must trouble you again:
 :No loving token to his Majesty?
 :
 :MARGARET
S:Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,
 :
 :Never yet taint with love, I send the King.
 :
 :
 :
S:SUFFOLK  And this withal.	[Kiss her.]
 :
 :
 :
S:MARGARET
 :
 :That for thyself. I will not so presume
 :
 :To send such peevish tokens to a king.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
S:O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay.
 :
 :Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth.
 :
 :There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
 :
 :Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise;
 :Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
S:And natural graces that extinguish art;
 :
 :Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
 :
 :That, when thou com'st to kneel at Henry's feet,
 :
 :Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
S:[He exits.]

 :Scene 4
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter York, Warwick, Shepherd,
 :and Pucelle, guarded.]
 :
 :
S:YORK
 :
 :Bring forth that sorceress condemned to burn.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright.
 :Have I sought every country far and near,
S:And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
 :
 :Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
 :
S:Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :
 :Decrepit miser, base ignoble wretch!
 :I am descended of a gentler blood.
 :Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :Out, out!--My lords, an please you, 'tis not so!
S:
 :I did beget her, all the parish knows;
 :
S:Her mother liveth yet, can testify
 :
 :She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK
 :Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?
 :
S:YORK
 :
 :This argues what her kind of life hath been,
 :
 :Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD
 :
 :Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
 :
 :God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,
 :
 :And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
 :Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Peasant, avaunt!--You have suborned this man
S:Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :
 :'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
 :The morn that I was wedded to her mother.--
 :Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
S:Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
 :
 :Of thy nativity! I would the milk
 :
 :Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her
 :
 :breast
 :Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
 :Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,
S:I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
 :
 :Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
 :
 :O burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :Take her away, for she hath lived too long
 :
 :To fill the world with vicious qualities.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :First, let me tell you whom you have condemned:
 :Not one begotten of a shepherd swain,
 :But issued from the progeny of kings,
S:
S:Virtuous and holy, chosen from above
 :
 :By inspiration of celestial grace
 :
S:To work exceeding miracles on earth.
 :
 :I never had to do with wicked spirits.
 :
S:But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
 :
 :Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents,
 :
 :Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
 :
 :Because you want the grace that others have,
 :You judge it straight a thing impossible
 :To compass wonders but by help of devils.
 :No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
 :A virgin from her tender infancy,
S:Chaste and immaculate in very thought,
 :
 :Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
 :
 :Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :Ay, ay.--Away with her to execution.
S:
 :
 :WARWICK
 :
 :And hark you, sirs: because she is a maid,
 :
 :Spare for no faggots; let there be enow.
 :Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
 :That so her torture may be shortened.
 :
 :PUCELLE
 :Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
S:
S:Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
 :
S:That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:
 :
 :I am with child, you bloody homicides.
 :
 :Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
 :
 :Although you hale me to a violent death.
 :
 :YORK
S:Now heaven forfend, the holy maid with child?
 :
 :
 :
S:WARWICK, [to Pucelle]
 :
 :The greatest miracle that e'er you wrought!
 :
 :Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
 :I did imagine what would be her refuge.
 :
S:WARWICK
 :
 :Well, go to, we'll have no bastards live,
 :
 :Especially since Charles must father it.
 :
 :
S:PUCELLE
 :
 :You are deceived; my child is none of his.
 :
 :It was Alanson that enjoyed my love.
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :Alanson, that notorious Machiavel?
S:It dies an if it had a thousand lives!
 :
 :
 :
S:PUCELLE
 :
 :O, give me leave! I have deluded you.
 :
 :'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I named,
 :
 :But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevailed.
 :
 :WARWICK
 :A married man? That's most intolerable.
 :
 :YORK
S:
 :Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well--
 :
 :There were so many--whom she may accuse.
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK
 :It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
 :
 :YORK
 :And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure!--
S:
 :Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.
 :
 :Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
 :
 :
 :
S:PUCELLE
 :
 :Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse:
 :
S:May never glorious sun reflex his beams
 :
S:Upon the country where you make abode,
 :
 :But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
 :
 :Environ you, till mischief and despair
 :
 :Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves.
 :[She exits, led by Guards.]
 :
 :YORK
 :Break thou in pieces, and consume to ashes,
 :Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
S:
S:
 :
 :[Enter Winchester, as Cardinal.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
S:Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence
 :
 :With letters of commission from the King.
 :
 :For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
 :
S:Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
 :
 :Have earnestly implored a general peace
 :
 :Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
 :
 :And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
S:Approacheth to confer about some matter.
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :Is all our travail turned to this effect?
 :After the slaughter of so many peers,
 :So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers
 :That in this quarrel have been overthrown
 :And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
S:Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
 :
 :Have we not lost most part of all the towns--
 :
 :By treason, falsehood, and by treachery--
 :
 :Our great progenitors had conquered?
S:O, Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief
 :
 :The utter loss of all the realm of France!
 :
 :
 :
 :WARWICK
 :Be patient, York; if we conclude a peace
 :It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
S:As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard,
 :
 :Reignier, with Attendants.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:CHARLES
 :
 :Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
 :
 :That peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in France,
 :
 :We come to be informed by yourselves
 :What the conditions of that league must be.
 :
 :YORK
 :Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes
S:The hollow passage of my poisoned voice
 :
 :By sight of these our baleful enemies.
 :
 :
 :
 :WINCHESTER
 :Charles and the rest, it is enacted thus:
 :That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
S:Of mere compassion and of lenity,
 :
 :To ease your country of distressful war
 :
 :And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
 :
 :You shall become true liegemen to his crown.
 :And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
 :To pay him tribute and submit thyself,
 :Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
 :And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
 :
S:
 :ALANSON
 :
 :Must he be then as shadow of himself--
 :
 :Adorn his temples with a coronet,
 :
S:And yet, in substance and authority,
 :
 :Retain but privilege of a private man?
 :
 :This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
 :
 :
 :CHARLES
 :'Tis known already that I am possessed
S:With more than half the Gallian territories,
 :
 :And therein reverenced for their lawful king.
 :
S:Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquished,
 :
 :Detract so much from that prerogative
 :
 :As to be called but viceroy of the whole?
 :
 :No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
 :That which I have than, coveting for more,
 :Be cast from possibility of all.
 :
 :YORK
 :Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means
S:
 :Used intercession to obtain a league
 :
 :And, now the matter grows to compromise,
 :
 :Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
 :
 :Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
 :Of benefit proceeding from our king
 :And not of any challenge of desert,
 :Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
 :
S:
 :REIGNIER, [aside to Charles]
 :
 :My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
 :
 :To cavil in the course of this contract.
 :
 :If once it be neglected, ten to one
 :We shall not find like opportunity.
 :
 :ALANSON, [aside to Charles]
 :To say the truth, it is your policy
S:
 :To save your subjects from such massacre
 :
S:And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
 :
 :By our proceeding in hostility;
 :
 :And therefore take this compact of a truce
 :
 :Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
S:
 :
 :WARWICK
 :
 :How say'st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?
 :
 :
S:CHARLES
 :
 :It shall--only reserved you claim no interest
 :
 :In any of our towns of garrison.
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :Then swear allegiance to his Majesty,
S:As thou art knight, never to disobey
 :
 :Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
 :
 :Thou nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
 :
 :[Charles, Alanson, Bastard, and Reignier
 :swear allegiance to Henry.]
S:So, now dismiss your army when you please;
 :
S:Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still,
 :
 :For here we entertain a solemn peace.
 :
 :[They exit.]

S:Scene 5
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Suffolk in conference with the King,
 :
 :Gloucester, and Exeter, with Attendants.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
S:Of beauteous Margaret hath astonished me.
 :
 :Her virtues graced with external gifts
 :
 :Do breed love's settled passions in my heart,
 :
 :And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
 :Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
 :So am I driven by breath of her renown
 :Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive
 :Where I may have fruition of her love.
 :
S:
 :SUFFOLK
 :
 :Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
 :
 :Is but a preface of her worthy praise.
 :
 :The chief perfections of that lovely dame,
 :Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
 :Would make a volume of enticing lines
 :Able to ravish any dull conceit;
 :And, which is more, she is not so divine,
S:
S:So full replete with choice of all delights,
 :
S:But with as humble lowliness of mind
 :
 :She is content to be at your command--
 :
 :Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents--
 :
 :To love and honor Henry as her lord.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.--
 :Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent
 :That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
S:
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :So should I give consent to flatter sin.
 :
 :You know, my lord, your Highness is betrothed
 :Unto another lady of esteem.
 :How shall we then dispense with that contract
 :And not deface your honor with reproach?
 :
S:
 :SUFFOLK
 :
S:As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
 :
 :Or one that, at a triumph having vowed
 :
 :To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
 :
 :By reason of his adversary's odds.
 :A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
 :And therefore may be broke without offense.
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
S:Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
 :
 :Her father is no better than an earl,
 :
 :Although in glorious titles he excel.
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :Yes, my lord, her father is a king,
 :The King of Naples and Jerusalem,
 :And of such great authority in France
S:As his alliance will confirm our peace,
 :
 :And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
 :Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
 :
 :EXETER
S:Besides, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
 :
 :Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
 :
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
 :A dower, my lords? Disgrace not so your king
 :That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
 :To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
 :Henry is able to enrich his queen,
 :And not to seek a queen to make him rich;
S:
 :So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
 :
 :As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
 :
 :Marriage is a matter of more worth
 :
 :Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.
 :Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
 :Must be companion of his nuptial bed.
 :And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
 :Most of all these reasons bindeth us
S:
 :In our opinions she should be preferred.
 :
 :For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
 :
 :An age of discord and continual strife?
 :
S:Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
 :
 :And is a pattern of celestial peace.
 :
 :Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
 :
 :But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
 :Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
 :Approves her fit for none but for a king.
 :Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
 :More than in women commonly is seen,
S:Will answer our hope in issue of a king.
 :
 :For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
 :
S:Is likely to beget more conquerors,
 :
 :If with a lady of so high resolve
 :
 :As is fair Margaret he be linked in love.
 :
 :Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me
 :That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Whether it be through force of your report,
 :My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
S:
 :My tender youth was never yet attaint
 :
 :With any passion of inflaming love,
 :
 :I cannot tell; but this I am assured:
 :
S:I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
 :
 :Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
 :
 :As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
 :
 :Take therefore shipping; post, my lord, to France;
 :Agree to any covenants, and procure
 :That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
 :To cross the seas to England and be crowned
 :King Henry's faithful and anointed queen.
 :For your expenses and sufficient charge,
S:
 :Among the people gather up a tenth.
 :
 :Be gone, I say, for till you do return,
 :
 :I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.--
 :
 :And you, good uncle, banish all offense.
S:If you do censure me by what you were,
 :
 :Not what you are, I know it will excuse
 :
 :This sudden execution of my will.
 :
 :And so conduct me where, from company,
 :I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
S:[He exits with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
S:GLOUCESTER
 :
 :Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
 :
 :[Gloucester exits with Exeter.]
 :
 :
 :SUFFOLK
S:Thus Suffolk hath prevailed, and thus he goes
 :
 :As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
 :
 :With hope to find the like event in love,
 :
 :But prosper better than the Trojan did.
 :Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the King,
 :But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.
 :[He exits.]
