 :Scene 1
 :=======
S:
 :[Enter two Gentlemen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods
 :No more obey the heavens than our courtiers'
S:Still seem as does the King's.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  But what's the matter?
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :His daughter, and the heir of 's kingdom, whom
 :He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
 :That late he married--hath referred herself
 :Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded,
S:
 :Her husband banished, she imprisoned. All
 :
 :Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
 :
 :Be touched at very heart.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  None but the King?
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :He that hath lost her, too. So is the Queen,
S:
 :That most desired the match. But not a courtier,
 :
 :Although they wear their faces to the bent
 :
 :Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not
 :
 :Glad at the thing they scowl at.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  And why so?
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
S:
 :He that hath missed the Princess is a thing
 :
 :Too bad for bad report, and he that hath her--
 :
 :I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
 :
 :And therefore banished--is a creature such
S:As, to seek through the regions of the Earth
 :
 :For one his like, there would be something failing
 :
 :In him that should compare. I do not think
 :
 :So fair an outward and such stuff within
S:Endows a man but he.
 :
 :
 :
S:SECOND GENTLEMAN  You speak him far.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :I do extend him, sir, within himself,
 :Crush him together rather than unfold
 :His measure duly.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  What's his name and birth?
 :
S:
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :I cannot delve him to the root. His father
 :
 :Was called Sicilius, who did join his honor
 :
 :Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
 :But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
S:He served with glory and admired success,
 :
 :So gained the sur-addition Leonatus;
 :
 :And had, besides this gentleman in question,
 :
 :Two other sons, who in the wars o' th' time
S:Died with their swords in hand. For which their
 :
 :father,
 :
 :Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
 :
 :That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
S:Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
 :
 :As he was born. The King he takes the babe
 :
 :To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
 :
 :Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,
 :Puts to him all the learnings that his time
 :Could make him the receiver of, which he took
 :As we do air, fast as 'twas ministered,
 :And in 's spring became a harvest; lived in court--
S:Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
 :
 :A sample to the youngest, to th' more mature
 :
 :A glass that feated them, and to the graver
 :
 :A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
 :For whom he now is banished, her own price
 :Proclaims how she esteemed him; and his virtue
 :By her election may be truly read
 :What kind of man he is.
 :
S:
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  I honor him
 :
 :Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
 :
 :Is she sole child to th' King?
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  His only child.
 :He had two sons--if this be worth your hearing,
S:Mark it--the eldest of them at three years old,
 :
 :I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
 :
 :Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
 :
 :Which way they went.
 :
S:SECOND GENTLEMAN  How long is this ago?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Some twenty years.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :That a king's children should be so conveyed,
 :So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
 :That could not trace them!
 :
S:
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
 :
 :Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,
 :
 :Yet is it true, sir.
 :
 :
S:SECOND GENTLEMAN  I do well believe you.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,
 :The Queen and Princess.
 :[They exit.]
 :
S:[Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN
 :No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
S:After the slander of most stepmothers,
 :
 :Evil-eyed unto you. You're my prisoner, but
 :
 :Your jailer shall deliver you the keys
 :
S:That lock up your restraint.--For you, Posthumus,
 :
 :So soon as I can win th' offended king,
 :
 :I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
 :
 :The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
 :You leaned unto his sentence with what patience
 :Your wisdom may inform you.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Please your Highness,
S:I will from hence today.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  You know the peril.
 :
 :I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
 :The pangs of barred affections, though the King
 :Hath charged you should not speak together.	[She exits.]
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  O,
 :
 :Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
 :
 :Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
 :I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing--
 :Always reserved my holy duty--what
S:His rage can do on me. You must be gone,
 :
 :And I shall here abide the hourly shot
 :
 :Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
 :
 :But that there is this jewel in the world
 :That I may see again.	[She weeps.]
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  My queen, my mistress!
 :O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
S:To be suspected of more tenderness
 :
 :Than doth become a man. I will remain
 :
 :The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth.
 :
 :My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
S:Who to my father was a friend, to me
 :
 :Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
 :
 :And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
 :
 :Though ink be made of gall.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Queen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  Be brief, I pray you.
 :If the King come, I shall incur I know not
 :How much of his displeasure. [(Aside.)] Yet I'll move
 :him
 :To walk this way. I never do him wrong
S:
 :But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,
 :
 :Pays dear for my offenses.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  Should we be taking leave
 :
 :As long a term as yet we have to live,
 :
 :The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Nay, stay a little!
 :Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
 :Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
 :This diamond was my mother's. [(She offers a
S:ring.)] Take it, heart,
 :
 :But keep it till you woo another wife
 :
 :When Imogen is dead.
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  How, how? Another?
 :You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
 :And cere up my embracements from a next
S:With bonds of death.	[(He puts the ring on his finger.)]
 :
 :Remain, remain thou here,
 :
 :While sense can keep it on.--And sweetest, fairest,
 :
S:As I my poor self did exchange for you
 :
 :To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
 :
 :I still win of you. For my sake, wear this.
 :
 :[He offers a bracelet.]
 :It is a manacle of love. I'll place it
 :Upon this fairest prisoner.	[He puts it on her wrist.]
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  O the gods!
 :
S:When shall we see again?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cymbeline and Lords.]
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Alack, the King.
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!
S:
 :If after this command thou fraught the court
 :
S:With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
 :
 :Thou 'rt poison to my blood.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  The gods protect you,
S:And bless the good remainders of the court.
 :
 :I am gone.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  There cannot be a pinch in death
 :More sharp than this is.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  O disloyal thing
 :That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
S:A year's age on me.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  I beseech you, sir,
 :
 :Harm not yourself with your vexation.
 :I am senseless of your wrath. A touch more rare
 :Subdues all pangs, all fears.
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Past grace? Obedience?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Past hope and in despair; that way past grace.
 :
S:CYMBELINE
 :
 :That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :O, blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle
 :And did avoid a puttock.
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
S:
S:A seat for baseness.
 :
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  No, I rather added
 :
S:A luster to it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  O thou vile one!
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Sir,
 :It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus.
 :You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
 :A man worth any woman, overbuys me
S:Almost the sum he pays.
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  What, art thou mad?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were
 :A neatherd's daughter, and my Leonatus
 :Our neighbor shepherd's son.	[She weeps.]
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Thou foolish thing!
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Queen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :They were again together. You have done
 :Not after our command. Away with her
 :And pen her up.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN  Beseech your patience.--Peace,
 :
 :Dear lady daughter, peace.--Sweet sovereign,
 :
S:Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some
 :
 :comfort
 :
 :Out of your best advice.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Nay, let her languish
 :A drop of blood a day, and being aged
 :Die of this folly.	[He exits, with Lords.]
S:
 :
 :QUEEN  Fie, you must give way.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Here is your servant.--How now, sir? What news?
S:
 :
 :PISANIO
 :
S:My lord your son drew on my master.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  Ha?
 :
 :No harm, I trust, is done?
 :
 :PISANIO  There might have been,
 :But that my master rather played than fought
 :And had no help of anger. They were parted
 :By gentlemen at hand.
S:
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  I am very glad on 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
 :To draw upon an exile. O, brave sir!
 :I would they were in Afric both together,
 :Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
S:
 :The goer-back.--Why came you from your master?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
 :
S:On his command. He would not suffer me
 :
 :To bring him to the haven, left these notes
 :
 :Of what commands I should be subject to
 :
 :When 't pleased you to employ me.
 :
 :QUEEN, [to Imogen]  This hath been
S:Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honor
 :
 :He will remain so.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  I humbly thank your Highness.
 :
 :QUEEN, [to Imogen]
 :Pray, walk awhile.
 :
S:IMOGEN, [to Pisanio]  About some half hour hence,
 :
 :Pray you, speak with me. You shall at least
 :
 :Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.

 :=======
 :[Enter Cloten and two Lords.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt. The
 :
 :violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice.
 :Where air comes out, air comes in. There's
 :none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
 :
 :CLOTEN  If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I
 :hurt him?
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  No, faith, not so much as his
 :
 :patience.
 :
 :
S:FIRST LORD  Hurt him? His body's a passable carcass if
 :
 :he be not hurt. It is a thoroughfare for steel if it be
 :
 :not hurt.
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o'
 :th' backside the town.
 :
 :CLOTEN  The villain would not stand me.
 :
S:
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  No, but he fled forward still,
 :
 :toward your face.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Stand you? You have land enough of your
 :
 :own, but he added to your having, gave you some
 :
 :ground.
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  As many inches as you have
 :oceans. Puppies!
 :
 :CLOTEN  I would they had not come between us.
S:
 :
 :
S:SECOND LORD, [aside]  So would I, till you had measured
 :
 :how long a fool you were upon the ground.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  And that she should love this fellow and
 :
 :refuse me!
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election
S:,
 :
 :she is damned.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and
 :her brain go not together. She's a good sign, but I
 :have seen small reflection of her wit.
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest
 :the reflection should hurt her.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had
 :
 :been some hurt done!
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  I wish not so, unless it had been
 :the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.
 :
 :CLOTEN  You'll go with us?
S:
 :
 :

 :
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN  Nay, come, let's go together.

 :
 :I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven
 :And questionedst every sail. If he should write

 :As offered mercy is. What was the last
 :That he spake to thee?
 :
S:
 :PISANIO  It was his queen, his queen!
 :
 :

S:
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :Senseless linen, happier therein than I.
 :
 :And that was all?
 :
 :PISANIO  No, madam. For so long
 :As he could make me with this eye or ear

 :The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief
S:
S:Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
 :

 :
 :PISANIO  Be assured, madam,
 :With his next vantage.
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :I did not take my leave of him, but had
 :
 :Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
 :How I would think on him at certain hours
 :Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear
S:The shes of Italy should not betray
 :
 :Mine interest and his honor; or have charged him
 :
 :At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight
 :
 :T' encounter me with orisons, for then
 :I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
 :Give him that parting kiss which I had set
 :Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,
 :And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
S:Shakes all our buds from growing.

 :
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He

 :But I could then have looked on him without the
S:help of admiration, though the catalogue of his

 :

S:

 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Since when I have been debtor to you for
 :
 :courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay
 :still.
S:
 :
 :FRENCHMAN  Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was
 :
 :glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had
 :
 :been pity you should have been put together with
 :so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance
 :of so slight and trivial a nature.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  By your pardon, sir, I was then a young
 :traveler, rather shunned to go even with what I
S:
 :heard than in my every action to be guided by others'
 :
S:experiences. But upon my mended judgment--
 :
 :if I offend not to say it is mended--my
 :
 :quarrel was not altogether slight.
 :
 :
 :FRENCHMAN  Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrament of
 :swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood
S:have confounded one the other or have fall'n
 :
 :both.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Can we with manners ask what was the
 :
 :difference?
 :
 :
 :FRENCHMAN  Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public,
 :which may without contradiction suffer the report.
 :It was much like an argument that fell out
 :last night, where each of us fell in praise of our
 :country mistresses, this gentleman at that time
S:
 :vouching--and upon warrant of bloody affirmation--
 :
 :his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste,
 :
 :constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any
 :
 :the rarest of our ladies in France.
 :
 :IACHIMO  That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
 :opinion by this worn out.
 :
S:
 :POSTHUMUS  She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of
 :
 :Italy.
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  Being so far provoked as I was in France,
 :
 :I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself
 :
 :her adorer, not her friend.
 :
 :
S:IACHIMO  As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
 :
 :comparison--had been something too fair and too
 :
 :good for any lady in Britain. If she went before
 :
 :others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlusters
 :many I have beheld, I could not but
 :believe she excelled many. But I have not seen the
 :most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  I praised her as I rated her. So do I my
 :
 :stone.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  What do you esteem it at?
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  More than the world enjoys.
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or
 :
S:she's outprized by a trifle.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  You are mistaken. The one may be sold or
 :
 :given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase
 :or merit for the gift. The other is not a thing
 :for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Which the gods have given you?
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Which, by their graces, I will keep.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  You may wear her in title yours, but you
S:know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds.
 :
 :Your ring may be stolen too. So your brace of unprizable
 :
 :estimations, the one is but frail and the
 :
 :other casual. A cunning thief or a that-way-accomplished
S:courtier would hazard the winning both of
 :
 :first and last.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Your Italy contains none so accomplished
 :a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if
 :in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I
 :do nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
 :notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
 :
S:
 :PHILARIO  Let us leave here, gentlemen.
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior,
 :
S:I thank him, makes no stranger of me. We are
 :
 :familiar at first.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  With five times so much conversation I
S:should get ground of your fair mistress, make her
 :
S:go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and
 :
 :opportunity to friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  No, no.
 :
S:IACHIMO  I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my
 :
 :estate to your ring, which in my opinion o'ervalues
 :
 :it something. But I make my wager rather against
 :
 :your confidence than her reputation, and, to bar
 :your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against
 :any lady in the world.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  You are a great deal abused in too bold a
 :persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what
S:
 :you're worthy of by your attempt.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  What's that?
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  A repulse--though your attempt, as you
 :call it, deserve more: a punishment, too.
 :
 :PHILARIO  Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too
 :suddenly. Let it die as it was born, and, I pray you,
S:be better acquainted.
 :
 :
 :
S:IACHIMO  Would I had put my estate and my neighbor's
 :
 :on th' approbation of what I have spoke.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  What lady would you choose to assail?
 :
 :IACHIMO  Yours, whom in constancy you think stands
 :so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your
 :ring that, commend me to the court where your
 :lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity
S:
 :of a second conference, and I will bring from
 :
 :thence that honor of hers which you imagine so
 :
 :reserved.
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I will wage against your gold, gold to it.
 :
 :My ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you
 :
 :buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
 :
S:preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some
 :
 :religion in you, that you fear.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  This is but a custom in your tongue. You
 :bear a graver purpose, I hope.
 :
S:IACHIMO  I am the master of my speeches and would
 :
S:undergo what's spoken, I swear.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till
 :
 :your return. Let there be covenants drawn between
 :'s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness
S:of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this
 :
 :match. Here's my ring.
 :
 :
 :
 :PHILARIO  I will have it no lay.
 :
 :IACHIMO  By the gods, it is one!--If I bring you no sufficie
 :nt
 :testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
 :bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand
S:
S:ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come
 :
 :off and leave her in such honor as you have trust
 :
 :in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
 :
 :yours, provided I have your commendation for my
S:more free entertainment.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I embrace these conditions. Let us have
 :
 :articles betwixt us. Only thus far you shall answer:
 :if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
 :to understand you have prevailed, I am no
 :further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If
 :she remain unseduced, you not making it appear
 :otherwise, for your ill opinion and th' assault you
S:
 :have made to her chastity, you shall answer me
 :
 :with your sword.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  Your hand; a covenant.	[(They shake hands.)]
 :We will have these things set down by lawful counsel,
 :and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain
S:should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold
 :
 :and have our two wagers recorded.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Agreed.	[Iachimo and Posthumus exit.]
 :
S:FRENCHMAN  Will this hold, think you?
 :
 :
 :
 :PHILARIO  Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us
 :
 :follow 'em.
 :[They exit.]

 :Scene 5
 :=======
 :[Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN
 :
 :Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers.
 :Make haste. Who has the note of them?
 :
 :LADY  I, madam.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN  Dispatch.	[Ladies exit.]
 :
 :Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
S:[He hands her a small box.]
 :
 :But I beseech your Grace, without offense--
 :
S:My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
 :
 :Commanded of me these most poisonous
 :
 :compounds,
 :
 :Which are the movers of a languishing death,
 :But though slow, deadly.
 :
 :QUEEN  I wonder, doctor,
 :Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
S:Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learned me how
 :
 :To make perfumes, distil, preserve--yea, so
 :
 :That our great king himself doth woo me oft
 :
 :For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,
 :Unless thou think'st me devilish, is 't not meet
 :That I did amplify my judgment in
S:Other conclusions? I will try the forces
 :
 :Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
 :
S:We count not worth the hanging--but none human--
 :
 :To try the vigor of them and apply
 :
 :Allayments to their act, and by them gather
 :
 :Their several virtues and effects.
 :
 :CORNELIUS  Your Highness
S:Shall from this practice but make hard your heart.
 :
 :Besides, the seeing these effects will be
 :
S:Both noisome and infectious.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN  O, content thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio.]
S:
 :
 :[Aside.] Here comes a flattering rascal. Upon him
 :
 :Will I first work. He's for his master
 :
 :And enemy to my son.--How now, Pisanio?--
 :Doctor, your service for this time is ended.
S:Take your own way.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS, [aside]  I do suspect you, madam,
 :
 :But you shall do no harm.
 :
 :QUEEN, [to Pisanio]  Hark thee, a word.
 :
 :CORNELIUS, [aside]
 :I do not like her. She doth think she has
S:
 :Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
 :
 :And will not trust one of her malice with
 :
 :A drug of such damned nature. Those she has
 :
S:Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
 :
 :Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs,
 :
 :Then afterward up higher. But there is
 :
 :No danger in what show of death it makes,
 :More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
 :To be more fresh, reviving. She is fooled
S:With a most false effect, and I the truer
 :
 :So to be false with her.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  No further service, doctor,
 :Until I send for thee.
 :
 :CORNELIUS  I humbly take my leave.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :QUEEN
 :
S:Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time
 :
 :She will not quench and let instructions enter
 :
 :Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
 :
S:When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
 :
 :I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
 :
 :As great as is thy master; greater, for
 :
 :His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
 :Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
 :Continue where he is. To shift his being
 :Is to exchange one misery with another,
S:And every day that comes comes to decay
 :
 :A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
 :
 :To be depender on a thing that leans,
 :
 :Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
 :So much as but to prop him? [(She drops the box
 :and Pisanio picks it up.)] Thou tak'st up
 :Thou know'st not what. But take it for thy labor.
 :It is a thing I made which hath the King
 :Five times redeemed from death. I do not know
S:
 :What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee, take it.
 :
 :It is an earnest of a farther good
 :
 :That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
 :
 :The case stands with her. Do 't as from thyself.
 :Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
 :Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
 :Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
 :To any shape of thy preferment such
S:
S:As thou 'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
 :
 :That set thee on to this desert, am bound
 :
 :To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
 :
 :Think on my words.	[Pisanio exits.]
 :A sly and constant knave,
S:Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
 :
S:And the remembrancer of her to hold
 :
 :The handfast to her lord. I have given him that
 :
S:Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
 :
 :Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
 :
 :Except she bend her humor, shall be assured
 :
 :To taste of too.
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio and Ladies carrying flowers.]
 :
 :[To the Ladies.] So, so. Well done, well done.
S:The violets, cowslips, and the primroses
 :
 :Bear to my closet.--Fare thee well, Pisanio.
 :
 :Think on my words.	[Queen and Ladies exit.]
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  And shall do.
 :But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
 :I'll choke myself; there's all I'll do for you.

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Imogen alone.]
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :A father cruel and a stepdame false,
 :A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
S:
 :That hath her husband banished. O, that husband,
 :
 :My supreme crown of grief and those repeated
 :
 :Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,

 :Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,

S:
 :[Enter Pisanio and Iachimo.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
 :Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
 :Comes from my lord with letters.
 :
 :IACHIMO  Change you,
S:
 :madam?
 :
 :The worthy Leonatus is in safety
 :
 :And greets your Highness dearly.
 :
 :[He gives her a letter.]
 :
 :IMOGEN  Thanks, good sir.
 :You're kindly welcome.
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO, [aside]
 :
 :All of her that is out of door, most rich!
 :
 :If she be furnished with a mind so rare,
 :She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I
 :Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend.
 :Arm me, audacity, from head to foot,
 :Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight--
 :Rather, directly fly.
S:
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN [reads:]  He is one of the noblest note, to whose
 :
 :kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
 :
S:him accordingly as you value your trust.
 :
 :Leonatus.
 :
 :So far I read aloud.
 :
 :But even the very middle of my heart
 :Is warmed by th' rest and takes it thankfully.--
 :You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
 :Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
 :In all that I can do.
 :
S:
 :IACHIMO  Thanks, fairest lady.--
 :
 :What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
 :
 :To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
 :
S:Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
 :
S:The fiery orbs above and the twinned stones
 :
 :Upon the numbered beach, and can we not
 :
 :Partition make with spectacles so precious
 :
S:'Twixt fair and foul?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  What makes your admiration?
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :It cannot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys
 :'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
 :Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,
 :For idiots in this case of favor would
S:
 :Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite--
 :
 :Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
 :
 :Should make desire vomit emptiness,
 :
S:Not so allured to feed.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :What is the matter, trow?
 :
S:IACHIMO  The cloyed will,
 :
 :That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
 :
 :Both filled and running, ravening first the lamb,
 :
S:Longs after for the garbage.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  What, dear sir,
 :
 :Thus raps you? Are you well?
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Thanks, madam, well.
 :
 :[(To Pisanio.)] Beseech you, sir,
 :
 :Desire my man's abode where I did leave him.
S:He's strange and peevish.
 :
 :

 :Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
 :
 :IACHIMO  Well, madam.
S:
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :
S:Exceeding pleasant. None a stranger there
 :
 :So merry and so gamesome. He is called
 :
 :The Briton Reveler.
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN  When he was here
 :
 :He did incline to sadness, and ofttimes
 :
 :Not knowing why.
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  I never saw him sad.
S:There is a Frenchman his companion, one
 :
 :An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves
 :
 :A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
 :
 :The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
 :Your lord, I mean--laughs from 's free lungs, cries "O,
S:Can my sides hold to think that man who knows
 :
 :By history, report, or his own proof
 :
 :What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
 :
 :But must be, will 's free hours languish for
S:Assured bondage?"
 :
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN  Will my lord say so?
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :
 :Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
 :It is a recreation to be by
 :And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens
 :know
 :Some men are much to blame.
 :
S:
 :IMOGEN  Not he, I hope.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :
S:Not he--but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
 :
S:Be used more thankfully. In himself 'tis much;
 :
 :In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.
 :
 :Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
 :
 :To pity too.
 :
 :IMOGEN  What do you pity, sir?
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :Two creatures heartily.
S:
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  Am I one, sir?
 :
 :You look on me. What wrack discern you in me
 :
 :Deserves your pity?
 :
 :IACHIMO  Lamentable! What,
 :To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
 :I' th' dungeon by a snuff?
 :
S:
 :IMOGEN  I pray you, sir,
 :
 :Deliver with more openness your answers
 :
S:To my demands. Why do you pity me?
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  That others do--
 :
 :I was about to say, enjoy your--but
 :
 :It is an office of the gods to venge it,
 :Not mine to speak on 't.
 :
S:IMOGEN  You do seem to know
 :
 :Something of me or what concerns me. Pray you,
 :
 :Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
 :
S:Than to be sure they do--for certainties
 :
 :Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
 :
 :The remedy then born--discover to me
 :
 :What both you spur and stop.
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Had I this cheek
 :
 :To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
 :
 :Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
 :To th' oath of loyalty; this object which
 :Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
 :Fixing it only here; should I, damned then,
 :Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
 :That mount the Capitol, join gripes with hands
S:
 :Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood as
 :
 :With labor; then by-peeping in an eye
 :
 :Base and illustrous as the smoky light
 :
 :That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
 :That all the plagues of hell should at one time
 :Encounter such revolt.
 :
 :IMOGEN  My lord, I fear,
S:
 :Has forgot Britain.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  And himself. Not I,
 :
 :Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
 :The beggary of his change, but 'tis your graces
 :That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
S:Charms this report out.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Let me hear no more.
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
S:With pity that doth make me sick. A lady
 :
 :So fair, and fastened to an empery
 :
 :Would make the great'st king double, to be partnered
 :
S:With tomboys hired with that self exhibition
 :
 :Which your own coffers yield, with diseased ventures
 :
 :That play with all infirmities for gold
 :
S:Which rottenness can lend nature; such boiled stuff
 :
 :As well might poison poison. Be revenged,
 :
 :Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
 :
 :Recoil from your great stock.
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  Revenged?
 :
 :How should I be revenged? If this be true--
 :
 :As I have such a heart that both mine ears
 :Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
 :How should I be revenged?
 :
 :IACHIMO  Should he make me
S:Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,
 :
 :Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
 :
 :In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
 :
S:I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
 :
 :More noble than that runagate to your bed,
 :
 :And will continue fast to your affection,
 :
S:Still close as sure.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  What ho, Pisanio!
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :Let me my service tender on your lips.
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
 :
 :So long attended thee. If thou wert honorable,
 :Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
 :For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.
 :Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
 :From thy report as thou from honor, and
 :Solicits here a lady that disdains
S:
S:Thee and the devil alike.--What ho, Pisanio!--
 :
 :The King my father shall be made acquainted
 :
 :Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
 :
S:A saucy stranger in his court to mart
 :
 :As in a Romish stew and to expound
 :
 :His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
 :
 :He little cares for and a daughter who
 :He not respects at all.--What ho, Pisanio!
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :O happy Leonatus! I may say
 :The credit that thy lady hath of thee
S:
 :Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
 :
 :Her assured credit.--Blessed live you long,
 :
 :A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
 :
S:Country called his; and you his mistress, only
 :
 :For the most worthiest fit. Give me your pardon.
 :
 :I have spoke this to know if your affiance
 :
 :Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
S:That which he is, new o'er; and he is one
 :
 :The truest mannered, such a holy witch
 :
 :That he enchants societies into him.
 :
 :Half all men's hearts are his.
 :
 :IMOGEN  You make amends.
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :He sits 'mongst men like a descended god.
S:
 :He hath a kind of honor sets him off
 :
 :More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
 :
S:Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
 :
 :To try your taking of a false report, which hath
 :
 :Honored with confirmation your great judgment
 :
 :In the election of a sir so rare,
 :Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
S:Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
 :
 :Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :All's well, sir. Take my power i' th' court for yours.
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
S:T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,
 :
 :And yet of moment too, for it concerns.
 :
 :Your lord, myself, and other noble friends
 :
 :Are partners in the business.
 :
 :IMOGEN  Pray, what is 't?
 :
 :IACHIMO
S:Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
 :
 :The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
 :
 :To buy a present for the Emperor;
 :
 :Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
S:In France. 'Tis plate of rare device and jewels
 :
 :Of rich and exquisite form, their values great.
 :
 :And I am something curious, being strange,
 :
 :To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
S:To take them in protection?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Willingly;
 :
 :And pawn mine honor for their safety. Since
S:My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
 :
 :In my bedchamber.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  They are in a trunk
S:Attended by my men. I will make bold
 :
 :To send them to you, only for this night.
 :
 :I must aboard tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  O no, no.

 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Cloten and the two Lords.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Was there ever man had such luck? When I
 :
 :kissed the jack, upon an upcast to be hit away? I
 :had a hundred pound on 't. And then a whoreson
S:jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
 :
 :borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend
 :
 :them at my pleasure.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  What got he by that? You have broke his
 :pate with your bowl.
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  If his wit had been like him that
 :broke it, it would have run all out.
S:
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN  When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is
 :
 :not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  No, my lord, [(aside)] nor crop the ears
 :of them.
 :
S:CLOTEN  Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would
 :
 :he had been one of my rank.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  To have smelled like a fool.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  I am not vexed more at anything in th' Earth.
 :
 :A pox on 't! I had rather not be so noble as I am.
 :
 :They dare not fight with me because of the Queen
 :my mother. Every jack-slave hath his bellyful of
S:fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock
 :
 :that nobody can match.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  You are cock and capon too, and
 :you crow cock with your comb on.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  Sayest thou?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  It is not fit your Lordship should undertake
 :every companion that you give offense to.
 :
 :CLOTEN  No, I know that, but it is fit I should commit
 :offense to my inferiors.
 :
S:
 :SECOND LORD  Ay, it is fit for your Lordship only.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Why, so I say.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Did you hear of a stranger that's come to
 :
 :court tonight?
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN  A stranger, and I not know on 't?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  He's a strange fellow himself and
 :
 :knows it not.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  There's an Italian come, and 'tis thought
 :one of Leonatus' friends.
 :
S:CLOTEN  Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he's another,
 :
 :whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  One of your Lordship's pages.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no
 :
 :derogation in 't?
 :
 :
S:SECOND LORD  You cannot derogate, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Not easily, I think.
 :
S:
 :
S:SECOND LORD, [aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore
 :
 :your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost
 :today at bowls I'll win tonight of him. Come, go.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  I'll attend your Lordship.
 :[Cloten and First Lord exit.]
 :That such a crafty devil as is his mother
S:
 :Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
 :
 :Bears all down with her brain, and this her son
 :
 :Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
 :
S:And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
 :
 :Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
 :
 :Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governed,
 :
 :A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
 :More hateful than the foul expulsion is
 :Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
 :Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
 :The walls of thy dear honor, keep unshaked
 :That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
S:
 :T' enjoy thy banished lord and this great land.

 :
 :[A trunk is brought in. Enter Imogen, reading, in her
 :
 :bed, and a Lady.]
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Who's there? My woman Helen?
 :
S:
 :LADY  Please you, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
S:What hour is it?
 :
 :
 :
 :LADY  Almost midnight, madam.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak.
 :[She hands the Lady her book.]
 :Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
 :Take not away the taper; leave it burning.
S:
 :And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
 :
 :I prithee, call me. [(Lady exits.)] Sleep hath seized
 :
 :me wholly.
 :
 :To your protection I commend me, gods.
S:From fairies and the tempters of the night
 :
 :Guard me, beseech you.	[Sleeps.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Iachimo from the trunk.]
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :The crickets sing, and man's o'erlabored sense
 :Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
S:
 :Did softly press the rushes ere he wakened
 :
 :The chastity he wounded.--Cytherea,
 :
 :How bravely thou becom'st thy bed, fresh lily,
 :
 :And whiter than the sheets.--That I might touch!
 :But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagoned,
 :How dearly they do 't. 'Tis her breathing that
 :Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper
 :Bows toward her and would underpeep her lids
S:
 :To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied
 :
 :Under these windows, white and azure-laced
 :
S:With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design:
 :
S:To note the chamber. I will write all down.
 :
 :[He begins to write.]
 :
 :Such and such pictures; there the window; such
 :
S:Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,
 :
 :Why, such and such; and the contents o' th' story.
 :
 :[He continues to write.]
 :
 :Ah, but some natural notes about her body
 :Above ten thousand meaner movables
 :Would testify t' enrich mine inventory.
 :O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her,
 :And be her sense but as a monument
S:Thus in a chapel lying. [(He begins to remove her
 :
 :bracelet.)] Come off, come off;
 :
 :As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard.
 :
 :'Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly
S:As strongly as the conscience does within
 :
 :To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast
 :
 :A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
 :
 :I' th' bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher
 :Stronger than ever law could make. This secret
 :Will force him think I have picked the lock and ta'en
 :The treasure of her honor. No more. To what end?
 :Why should I write this down that's riveted,
 :Screwed to my memory? She hath been reading late
S:
 :The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turned down
 :
 :Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
 :
 :To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
 :
S:Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
 :
 :May bare the raven's eye. I lodge in fear.
 :
 :Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
 :
S:[Clock strikes.]

S:Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Cloten and Lords.]
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Your Lordship is the most patient man in
 :
 :loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  It would make any man cold to lose.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  But not every man patient after the noble
 :temper of your Lordship. You are most hot and
S:furious when you win.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Winning will put any man into courage. If I
 :
 :could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold
 :enough. It's almost morning, is 't not?
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Day, my lord.
 :
 :CLOTEN  I would this music would come. I am advised
S:
 :to give her music a-mornings; they say it will
 :
 :penetrate.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Musicians.]
 :
 :Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your
 :fingering, so. We'll try with tongue, too. If none
S:will do, let her remain, but I'll never give o'er. First,
 :
 :a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful
 :
S:sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,
 :
 :and then let her consider.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Musicians begin to play.]
 :Song.
 :
 :Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings,
 :And Phoebus gins arise,
 :His steeds to water at those springs
S:
 :On chaliced flowers that lies;
 :
 :And winking Mary-buds begin
 :
S:To ope their golden eyes.
 :
 :With everything that pretty is,
 :
 :My lady sweet, arise,
 :
 :Arise, arise.
 :
 :CLOTEN  So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
 :consider your music the better. If it do not, it is a
S:vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves'
 :
 :guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can
 :
S:never amend.
 :
 :[Musicians exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cymbeline and Queen, with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Here comes the King.
 :
 :CLOTEN  I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason
S:
 :I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this
 :
 :service I have done fatherly.--Good morrow to
 :
 :your Majesty and to my gracious mother.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
 :Will she not forth?
 :
S:
 :CLOTEN  I have assailed her with musics, but she
 :
 :vouchsafes no notice.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :The exile of her minion is too new;
 :She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time
 :Must wear the print of his remembrance on 't,
S:And then she's yours.
 :
 :
 :
S:QUEEN, [to Cloten]  You are most bound to th' King,
 :
 :Who lets go by no vantages that may
 :
 :Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
 :
 :To orderly solicits and be friended
S:With aptness of the season. Make denials
 :
 :Increase your services. So seem as if
 :
 :You were inspired to do those duties which
 :
 :You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
S:Save when command to your dismission tends,
 :
S:And therein you are senseless.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Senseless? Not so.
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER, [to Cymbeline]
 :
 :So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
 :The one is Caius Lucius.	[Messenger exits.]
 :
S:CYMBELINE  A worthy fellow,
 :
 :Albeit he comes on angry purpose now.
 :
 :But that's no fault of his. We must receive him
 :
 :According to the honor of his sender,
S:And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
 :
 :We must extend our notice.--Our dear son,
 :
 :When you have given good morning to your mistress,
 :
 :Attend the Queen and us. We shall have need
 :T' employ you towards this Roman.--Come, our
S:queen.
 :
 :[Cymbeline and Queen exit, with
 :
 :Lords and Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
 :Let her lie still and dream. [(He knocks.)] By your
S:leave, ho!--
 :
 :I know her women are about her. What
 :
 :If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
 :
 :Which buys admittance--oft it doth--yea, and makes
 :Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
 :Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold
S:Which makes the true man killed and saves the thief,
 :
S:Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What
 :
S:Can it not do and undo? I will make
 :
 :One of her women lawyer to me, for
 :
 :I yet not understand the case myself.
 :
 :By your leave.	[Knocks.]
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Lady.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LADY
 :Who's there that knocks?
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  A gentleman.
 :
 :
 :
 :LADY  No more?
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
 :
 :LADY  That's more
S:
 :Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
 :
S:Can justly boast of. What's your Lordship's pleasure?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :
 :Your lady's person. Is she ready?
S:
 :
 :LADY  Ay,
 :
 :To keep her chamber.
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN  There is gold for you.
 :
 :Sell me your good report.	[He offers a purse.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LADY
 :How, my good name? Or to report of you
 :What I shall think is good?
 :
 :[Enter Imogen.]
S:
 :
 :The Princess.
 :
 :[Lady exits.]
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN
 :
 :Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
 :For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
 :Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
 :And scarce can spare them.
 :
S:
 :CLOTEN  Still I swear I love you.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.
 :If you swear still, your recompense is still
 :That I regard it not.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  This is no answer.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
S:I would not speak. I pray you, spare me. Faith,
 :
 :I shall unfold equal discourtesy
 :
 :To your best kindness. One of your great knowing
 :
 :Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin.
 :I will not.
 :
S:
S:IMOGEN
 :
S:Fools are not mad folks.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Do you call me fool?
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  As I am mad, I do.
S:If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad.
 :
 :That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
 :
 :You put me to forget a lady's manners
 :
 :By being so verbal; and learn now for all
 :That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
S:By th' very truth of it, I care not for you,
 :
 :And am so near the lack of charity
 :
 :To accuse myself I hate you--which I had rather
 :
 :You felt than make 't my boast.
 :
S:CLOTEN  You sin against
 :
 :Obedience, which you owe your father. For
 :
 :The contract you pretend with that base wretch--
 :
 :One bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes,
 :With scraps o' th' court--it is no contract, none;
 :And though it be allowed in meaner parties--
 :Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
 :On whom there is no more dependency
 :But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
S:
S:Yet you are curbed from that enlargement by
 :
S:The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil
 :
 :The precious note of it with a base slave,
 :
S:A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
 :
 :A pantler--not so eminent.
 :
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN  Profane fellow,
 :
 :Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
 :
 :But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
 :
 :To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
 :Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
 :Comparative for your virtues to be styled
 :The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated
 :For being preferred so well.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  The south fog rot him!
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :He never can meet more mischance than come
 :To be but named of thee. His mean'st garment
 :That ever hath but clipped his body is dearer
 :In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
 :Were they all made such men.--How now, Pisanio!
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  "His garment"? Now the devil--
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [to Pisanio]
 :To Dorothy, my woman, hie thee presently.
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :"His garment"?
 :
S:
 :IMOGEN, [to Pisanio]  I am sprighted with a fool,
 :
S:Frighted and angered worse. Go bid my woman
 :
 :Search for a jewel that too casually
 :
 :Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's. Shrew me
 :
 :If I would lose it for a revenue
 :Of any king's in Europe. I do think
 :I saw 't this morning. Confident I am
S:Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kissed it.
 :
 :I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
 :
 :That I kiss aught but he.
 :
 :
S:PISANIO  'Twill not be lost.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :I hope so. Go and search.	[Pisanio exits.]
 :
 :CLOTEN  You have abused me.
 :"His meanest garment"?
 :
S:IMOGEN  Ay, I said so, sir.
 :
 :If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
S:I will inform your father.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Your mother too.
 :
 :She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,
 :But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,
 :To th' worst of discontent.	[She exits.]

S:
 :Fear it not, sir. I would I were so sure

 :To win the King as I am bold her honor
 :
 :Will remain hers.
 :
S:
 :
 :PHILARIO  What means do you make to him?
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :
 :Not any, but abide the change of time,

 :Quake in the present winter's state, and wish
 :That warmer days would come. In these feared
 :hopes
 :I barely gratify your love; they failing,

 :
S:
 :PHILARIO
 :
 :Your very goodness and your company
 :
 :O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
 :
 :Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
 :Will do 's commission throughly. And I think
 :He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,
 :Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
S:Is yet fresh in their grief.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I do believe,
 :
 :Statist though I am none nor like to be,
 :That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
 :The legion now in Gallia sooner landed
 :In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
 :Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
 :Are men more ordered than when Julius Caesar
S:
 :Smiled at their lack of skill but found their courage
 :
 :Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
 :
 :Now winged with their courages, will make known
 :
S:To their approvers they are people such
 :
 :That mend upon the world.
 :
S:

 :
 :
 :
 :PHILARIO  See, Iachimo!
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :
 :The swiftest harts have posted you by land,
 :
 :And winds of all the corners kissed your sails
 :To make your vessel nimble.
 :
 :PHILARIO  Welcome, sir.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
S:
 :I hope the briefness of your answer made
 :
 :The speediness of your return.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  Your lady
 :
 :Is one of the fairest that I have looked upon.
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :And therewithal the best, or let her beauty
 :Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts
 :And be false with them.
 :
S:
 :IACHIMO, [handing him a paper]  Here are letters for you.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :
 :Their tenor good, I trust.
 :
 :IACHIMO  'Tis very like.
 :[Posthumus reads the letter.]
 :
S:
 :PHILARIO
 :
 :Was Caius Lucius in the Briton court
 :
 :When you were there?
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :
 :He was expected then, but not approached.
 :
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  All is well yet.
 :
 :Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is 't not
 :
 :Too dull for your good wearing?
 :
 :[He indicates his ring.]
 :
 :IACHIMO  If I have lost it,
S:I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
 :
 :I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy
 :
 :A second night of such sweet shortness which
 :
 :Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :The stone's too hard to come by.
 :
 :IACHIMO  Not a whit,
S:
 :Your lady being so easy.
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Make not, sir,
 :
 :Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
 :
 :Must not continue friends.
 :
 :IACHIMO  Good sir, we must,
 :If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
 :The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
 :We were to question farther; but I now
S:
 :Profess myself the winner of her honor,
 :
 :Together with your ring, and not the wronger
 :
 :Of her or you, having proceeded but
 :
S:By both your wills.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  If you can make 't apparent
 :
 :That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
 :And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion
 :You had of her pure honor gains or loses
 :Your sword or mine, or masterless leave both
 :To who shall find them.
 :
S:
 :IACHIMO  Sir, my circumstances,
 :
 :Being so near the truth as I will make them,
 :
 :Must first induce you to believe; whose strength
 :
 :I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not
 :You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
 :You need it not.
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  Proceed.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  First, her bedchamber--
 :
 :Where I confess I slept not, but profess
S:Had that was well worth watching--it was hanged
 :
S:With tapestry of silk and silver, the story
 :
 :Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
 :
 :And Cydnus swelled above the banks, or for
 :
 :The press of boats or pride. A piece of work
 :So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
S:In workmanship and value, which I wondered
 :
 :Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
 :
S:Since the true life on 't was--
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  This is true,
 :
 :And this you might have heard of here, by me
 :Or by some other.
 :
 :IACHIMO  More particulars
S:Must justify my knowledge.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  So they must,
 :
 :Or do your honor injury.
 :
 :IACHIMO  The chimney
 :Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
 :Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
 :So likely to report themselves; the cutter
S:
 :Was as another Nature, dumb, outwent her,
 :
 :Motion and breath left out.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  This is a thing
S:Which you might from relation likewise reap,
 :
 :Being, as it is, much spoke of.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  The roof o' th' chamber
 :With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons--
 :I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
 :Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
 :Depending on their brands.
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  This is her honor?
 :
 :Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
 :
 :Be given to your remembrance--the description
 :Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
 :The wager you have laid.
 :
 :IACHIMO  Then if you can
S:Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See--
 :
 :[He shows the bracelet.]
 :
 :And now 'tis up again. It must be married
 :
 :To that your diamond. I'll keep them.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Jove!
S:Once more let me behold it. Is it that
 :
 :Which I left with her?
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  Sir, I thank her, that.
 :She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet.
 :Her pretty action did outsell her gift
 :And yet enriched it too. She gave it me
 :And said she prized it once.
 :
S:
 :POSTHUMUS  Maybe she plucked it off
 :
 :To send it me.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  She writes so to you, doth she?
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :O, no, no, no, 'tis true. Here, take this too.
 :[He gives Iachimo the ring.]
S:
 :It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
 :
S:Kills me to look on 't. Let there be no honor
 :
 :Where there is beauty, truth where semblance, love
 :
 :Where there's another man. The vows of women
 :
 :Of no more bondage be to where they are made
 :Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
 :O, above measure false!
 :
 :PHILARIO  Have patience, sir,
 :And take your ring again. 'Tis not yet won.
S:
 :It may be probable she lost it; or
 :
S:Who knows if one her women, being corrupted,
 :
 :Hath stol'n it from her.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Very true,
 :And so I hope he came by 't.--Back, my ring!
S:[He takes back the ring.]
 :
S:Render to me some corporal sign about her
 :
 :More evident than this, for this was stol'n.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
 :
S:POSTHUMUS
 :
 :Hark you, he swears! By Jupiter he swears.
 :
S:'Tis true--nay, keep the ring--'tis true.
 :
 :[He holds out the ring.]
 :
 :I am sure
 :
 :She would not lose it. Her attendants are
 :All sworn and honorable. They induced to steal it?
 :And by a stranger? No, he hath enjoyed her.
S:The cognizance of her incontinency
 :
 :Is this. She hath bought the name of whore thus
 :
 :dearly.
 :
 :There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell
 :Divide themselves between you!
 :[He gives the ring to Iachimo.]
 :
 :PHILARIO  Sir, be patient.
S:This is not strong enough to be believed
 :
 :Of one persuaded well of.
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Never talk on 't.
 :
 :She hath been colted by him.
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  If you seek
 :For further satisfying, under her breast,
 :Worthy the pressing, lies a mole, right proud
 :Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
 :I kissed it, and it gave me present hunger
S:
 :To feed again, though full. You do remember
 :
 :This stain upon her?
 :
 :
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  Ay, and it doth confirm
 :
 :Another stain as big as hell can hold,
 :
 :Were there no more but it.
 :
 :
S:IACHIMO  Will you hear more?
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Spare your arithmetic;
 :
 :Never count the turns. Once, and a million!
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  I'll be sworn--
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  No swearing.
S:If you will swear you have not done 't, you lie,
 :
 :And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
 :
 :Thou 'st made me cuckold.
 :
S:
 :
 :IACHIMO  I'll deny nothing.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
 :I will go there and do 't i' th' court, before
S:Her father. I'll do something.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PHILARIO  Quite beside
 :
S:The government of patience. You have won.

 :

S:
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, and Lords at
 :
 :one door, and, at another, Caius Lucius and Attendants.]
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :
 :Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
 :Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
 :Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
 :And conquered it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
S:
 :Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less
 :
 :Than in his feats deserving it, for him
 :
 :And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
 :
 :Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
 :Is left untendered.
 :
 :QUEEN  And, to kill the marvel,
 :Shall be so ever.
S:
 :
 :
S:CLOTEN  There be many Caesars
 :
 :Ere such another Julius. Britain's a world
 :
 :By itself, and we will nothing pay
 :
 :For wearing our own noses.
 :
 :QUEEN  That opportunity
 :Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
 :We have again.--Remember, sir, my liege,
 :The Kings your ancestors, together with
S:
 :The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
 :
 :As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
 :
 :With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
 :
 :With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats
 :But suck them up to th' topmast. A kind of conquest
 :Caesar made here, but made not here his brag
 :Of "came, and saw, and overcame." With shame--
 :The first that ever touched him--he was carried
S:
 :From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping,
 :
 :Poor ignorant baubles, on our terrible seas
 :
 :Like eggshells moved upon their surges, cracked
 :
 :As easily 'gainst our rocks. For joy whereof
 :The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
 :O, giglet Fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
 :Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright
 :And Britons strut with courage.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our
 :
 :kingdom is stronger than it was at that time, and,
 :
 :as I said, there is no more such Caesars. Other of
 :them may have crooked noses, but to owe such
S:straight arms, none.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Son, let your mother end.
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  We have yet many among us can grip as hard
 :as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one, but I have a
 :hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If
 :Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
 :put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
S:
 :for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Lucius]  You must know,
 :
 :Till the injurious Romans did extort
 :This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition,
 :Which swelled so much that it did almost stretch
S:The sides o' th' world, against all color here
 :
S:Did put the yoke upon 's, which to shake off
 :
 :Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
 :
 :Ourselves to be. We do say, then, to Caesar,
 :
 :Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
 :Ordained our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
 :Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise
 :Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
 :Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made
 :our laws,
S:
 :Who was the first of Britain which did put
 :
S:His brows within a golden crown and called
 :
 :Himself a king.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS  I am sorry, Cymbeline,
 :
 :That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
 :
 :Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
 :Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy.
 :Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
 :In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee. Look
 :For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
 :I thank thee for myself.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Thou art welcome, Caius.
 :
 :Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
 :
S:Much under him. Of him I gathered honor,
 :
 :Which he to seek of me again perforce
 :
 :Behooves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
 :
 :That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
 :Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
 :Which not to read would show the Britons cold.
 :So Caesar shall not find them.
 :
S:LUCIUS  Let proof speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  His Majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime
 :
 :with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards
 :in other terms, you shall find us in our saltwater
 :girdle; if you beat us out of it, it is yours. If
 :you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the
 :better for you, and there's an end.
 :
S:
S:LUCIUS  So, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :
S:I know your master's pleasure, and he mine.
 :
 :All the remain is welcome.

 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
 :How? Of adultery? Wherefore write you not
 :What monsters her accuse? Leonatus,
S:O master, what a strange infection
 :
 :Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
 :
 :As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevailed
 :
 :On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
 :She's punished for her truth and undergoes,
 :More goddesslike than wifelike, such assaults
 :As would take in some virtue. O my master,
 :Thy mind to her is now as low as were
 :Thy fortunes. How? That I should murder her,
S:
 :Upon the love and truth and vows which I
 :
 :Have made to thy command? I her? Her blood?
 :
 :If it be so to do good service, never
 :
 :Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
 :That I should seem to lack humanity
 :So much as this fact comes to? [(He reads:)] Do 't!
 :The letter
S:That I have sent her, by her own command
 :
 :Shall give thee opportunity. O damned paper,
 :
 :Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
 :
 :Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st
S:So virginlike without? Lo, here she comes.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Imogen.]
 :
 :
S:I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  How now, Pisanio?
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
 :Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
S:[He gives her a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
 :Who, thy lord that is my lord, Leonatus?
 :O, learned indeed were that astronomer
 :That knew the stars as I his characters!
 :He'd lay the future open. You good gods,
 :Let what is here contained relish of love,
 :Of my lord's health, of his content (yet not
S:
 :That we two are asunder; let that grieve him.
 :
 :Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
 :
 :For it doth physic love) of his content
 :
S:All but in that. Good wax, thy leave.
 :
 :[She opens the letter.]
 :
S:Blest be
 :
 :You bees that make these locks of counsel. Lovers
 :
 :And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
 :
 :Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
S:You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
 :
 :[Reads.] Justice and your father's wrath, should he
 :
 :take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me
 :
 :as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew
 :me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria
 :at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
 :this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness,
 :that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing
 :in love.
S:
 :Leonatus Posthumus.
 :
 :O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
 :
 :He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
 :
 :How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
 :May plod it in a week, why may not I
 :Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,
 :Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st--
 :O, let me bate--but not like me, yet long'st
S:
 :But in a fainter kind--O, not like me,
 :
 :For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick--
 :
 :Love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing
 :
 :To th' smothering of the sense--how far it is
S:To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way
 :
 :Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
 :
 :T' inherit such a haven. But first of all,
 :
 :How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
 :That we shall make in time from our hence-going
 :And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence?
 :Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
 :We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
 :How many score of miles may we well rid
S:
 :'Twixt hour and hour?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  One score 'twixt sun and sun,
 :
 :Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.
 :
 :IMOGEN
S:Why, one that rode to 's execution, man,
 :
 :Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
 :
S:Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
 :
 :That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fool'ry.
 :
S:Go, bid my woman feign a sickness, say
 :
 :She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
 :
 :A riding suit no costlier than would fit
 :
 :A franklin's huswife.
 :
 :PISANIO  Madam, you're best consider.
 :
 :IMOGEN
S:I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,
 :
S:Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
 :
 :That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee.
 :
S:Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say.
 :
 :Accessible is none but Milford way.

S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :
 :A goodly day not to keep house with such
 :
 :Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys. This gate
S:Instructs you how t' adore the heavens and bows you
 :
 :To a morning's holy office. The gates of monarchs
 :
S:Are arched so high that giants may jet through
 :
 :And keep their impious turbans on, without
 :
 :Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
 :
 :We house i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly
 :As prouder livers do.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Hail, heaven!
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Hail, heaven!
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill;
 :Your legs are young. I'll tread these flats. Consider,
 :When you above perceive me like a crow,
 :That it is place which lessens and sets off,
S:
 :And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
 :
 :Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
 :
 :This service is not service, so being done,
 :
 :But being so allowed. To apprehend thus
 :Draws us a profit from all things we see,
 :And often, to our comfort, shall we find
 :The sharded beetle in a safer hold
S:Than is the full-winged eagle. O, this life
 :
 :Is nobler than attending for a check,
 :
 :Richer than doing nothing for a robe,
 :
S:Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
 :
 :Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine
 :
 :Yet keeps his book uncrossed. No life to ours.
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
S:Out of your proof you speak. We poor unfledged
 :
 :Have never winged from view o' th' nest, nor know
 :
 :not
 :
 :What air 's from home. Haply this life is best
S:If quiet life be best, sweeter to you
 :
 :That have a sharper known, well corresponding
 :
 :With your stiff age; but unto us it is
 :
 :A cell of ignorance, traveling abed,
S:A prison for a debtor that not dares
 :
 :To stride a limit.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  What should we speak of
 :When we are old as you? When we shall hear
 :The rain and wind beat dark December, how
 :In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
 :The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.
S:We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
 :
 :Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
 :
 :Our valor is to chase what flies. Our cage
 :
 :We make a choir, as doth the prisoned bird,
 :And sing our bondage freely.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  How you speak!
 :Did you but know the city's usuries
 :And felt them knowingly; the art o' th' court,
S:
 :As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
 :
 :Is certain falling, or so slipp'ry that
 :
 :The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,
 :
 :A pain that only seems to seek out danger
 :I' th' name of fame and honor, which dies i' th' search
 :And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
 :As record of fair act--nay, many times
 :Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
S:
 :Must curtsy at the censure. O boys, this story
 :
 :The world may read in me. My body's marked
 :
 :With Roman swords, and my report was once
 :
 :First with the best of note. Cymbeline loved me,
 :And when a soldier was the theme, my name
 :Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
 :Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night
S:A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
 :
 :Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
 :
S:And left me bare to weather.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Uncertain favor!
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,
S:But that two villains, whose false oaths prevailed
 :
 :Before my perfect honor, swore to Cymbeline
 :
 :I was confederate with the Romans. So
 :
S:Followed my banishment; and this twenty years
 :
 :This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
 :
 :Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
 :
 :More pious debts to heaven than in all
 :The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!
 :This is not hunters' language. He that strikes
 :The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;
 :To him the other two shall minister,
 :And we will fear no poison, which attends
S:
S:In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
 :
 :[Guiderius and Arviragus exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS
 :How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
 :These boys know little they are sons to th' King,
 :Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
 :They think they are mine, and, though trained up
 :thus meanly,
S:
 :I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
 :
 :The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
 :
 :In simple and low things to prince it much
 :
 :Beyond the trick of others. This Polydor,
 :The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
 :The King his father called Guiderius--Jove!
S:When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
 :
 :The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
 :
 :Into my story; say "Thus mine enemy fell,
 :
 :And thus I set my foot on 's neck," even then
 :The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
S:Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
 :
 :That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
 :
 :Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
 :
 :Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
 :His own conceiving. Hark, the game is roused!
 :O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
 :Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,
S:At three and two years old I stole these babes,
 :
 :Thinking to bar thee of succession as
 :
 :Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
 :
 :Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their
 :mother,
 :And every day do honor to her grave.
 :Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan called,
 :They take for natural father. The game is up!

 :for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of
 :hers. Let thine own hands take away her life. I shall
 :give thee opportunity at Milford Haven--she hath
 :my letter for the purpose--where, if thou fear to
 :strike and to make me certain it is done, thou art the
S:
 :pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO, [aside]
 :
 :What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
 :Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
 :Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
 :Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
 :Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
S:
 :All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
 :
 :Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
 :
 :This viperous slander enters.--What cheer, madam?
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN
 :
 :False to his bed? What is it to be false?
 :
S:To lie in watch there and to think on him?
 :
 :To weep 'twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,
 :
 :To break it with a fearful dream of him
 :
 :And cry myself awake? That's false to 's bed, is it?
 :
 :PISANIO  Alas, good lady!
 :
S:IMOGEN
 :
S:I false? Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,
 :
 :Thou didst accuse him of incontinency.
 :
 :Thou then looked'st like a villain. Now methinks
 :
 :Thy favor's good enough. Some jay of Italy,
 :Whose mother was her painting, hath betrayed him.
 :Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
 :And, for I am richer than to hang by th' walls,
 :I must be ripped. To pieces with me! O,
 :Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
S:
 :By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
 :
S:Put on for villainy, not born where 't grows,
 :
 :But worn a bait for ladies.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Good madam, hear me.
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :True honest men, being heard like false Aeneas,
 :Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
 :Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
S:
 :From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,
 :
S:Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
 :
 :Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
 :
 :From thy great fail.--Come, fellow, be thou honest;
 :
 :Do thou thy master's bidding. When thou seest him,
S:A little witness my obedience. Look,
 :
 :I draw the sword myself.
 :
 :[She draws Pisanio's sword from its
 :
 :scabbard and hands it to him.]
 :Take it, and hit
 :The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
S:Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief.
 :
 :Thy master is not there, who was indeed
 :
 :The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.
 :
 :Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
 :But now thou seem'st a coward.
 :
 :PISANIO, [throwing down the sword]  Hence, vile
 :instrument!
 :Thou shalt not damn my hand.
S:
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Why, I must die,
 :
 :And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
 :
 :No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
 :There is a prohibition so divine
 :That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart--
 :Something's afore 't. Soft, soft! We'll no defense--
 :Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
S:
 :[She takes papers from her bodice.]
 :
S:The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
 :
 :All turned to heresy? Away, away!
 :
 :[She throws away the letters.]
 :
 :Corrupters of my faith, you shall no more
 :Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
 :Believe false teachers. Though those that are betrayed
 :Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
 :Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,
 :That didst set up
S:
 :My disobedience 'gainst the King my father
 :
 :And make me put into contempt the suits
 :
 :Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
 :
 :It is no act of common passage, but
 :A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
 :To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
 :That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
 :Will then be panged by me.--Prithee, dispatch.
S:
 :The lamb entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife?
 :
 :Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
 :
 :When I desire it too.
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  O gracious lady,
S:Since I received command to do this business
 :
 :I have not slept one wink.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Do 't, and to bed, then.
 :
 :PISANIO
 :I'll wake mine eyeballs out first.
 :
 :IMOGEN  Wherefore then
S:
S:Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
 :
S:So many miles with a pretense? This place?
 :
 :Mine action and thine own? Our horses' labor?
 :
 :The time inviting thee? The perturbed court
 :
 :For my being absent, whereunto I never
 :Purpose return? Why hast thou gone so far
 :To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
 :Th' elected deer before thee?
 :
S:PISANIO  But to win time
 :
 :To lose so bad employment, in the which
 :
S:I have considered of a course. Good lady,
 :
 :Hear me with patience.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Talk thy tongue weary.
 :Speak.
S:I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,
 :
 :Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
 :
 :Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Then, madam,
 :I thought you would not back again.
 :
 :IMOGEN  Most like,
 :Bringing me here to kill me.
S:
S:
 :
 :PISANIO  Not so, neither.
 :
 :But if I were as wise as honest, then
 :
 :My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
 :But that my master is abused. Some villain,
 :Ay, and singular in his art, hath done
 :You both this cursed injury.
 :
 :IMOGEN
S:
 :Some Roman courtesan?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  No, on my life.
 :
 :I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him
 :Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded
 :I should do so. You shall be missed at court,
 :And that will well confirm it.
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  Why, good fellow,
 :
 :What shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?
 :
 :Or in my life what comfort when I am
S:Dead to my husband?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  If you'll back to th' court--
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :No court, no father, nor no more ado
 :With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
 :That Cloten, whose love suit hath been to me
 :As fearful as a siege.
S:
 :
 :
S:PISANIO  If not at court,
 :
 :Then not in Britain must you bide.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Where, then?
 :Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
 :Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume
 :Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't,
 :In a great pool a swan's nest. Prithee think
 :There's livers out of Britain.
S:
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  I am most glad
 :
 :You think of other place. Th' ambassador,
 :
 :Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven
 :Tomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
 :Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
 :That which t' appear itself must not yet be
 :But by self-danger, you should tread a course
S:
 :Pretty and full of view: yea, haply near
 :
 :The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,
 :
 :That though his actions were not visible, yet
 :
 :Report should render him hourly to your ear
 :As truly as he moves.
 :
 :IMOGEN  O, for such means,
 :Though peril to my modesty, not death on 't,
S:
 :I would adventure.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Well then, here's the point:
 :
 :You must forget to be a woman; change
 :Command into obedience, fear and niceness--
 :The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
 :Woman it pretty self--into a waggish courage,
 :Ready in gibes, quick-answered, saucy, and
S:
 :As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must
 :
 :Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
 :
 :Exposing it--but O, the harder heart!
 :
S:Alack, no remedy--to the greedy touch
 :
 :Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
 :
 :Your laborsome and dainty trims, wherein
 :
 :You made great Juno angry.
 :
 :IMOGEN  Nay, be brief.
 :I see into thy end and am almost
 :A man already.
 :
S:
 :PISANIO  First, make yourself but like one.
 :
 :Forethinking this, I have already fit--
 :
 :'Tis in my cloakbag--doublet, hat, hose, all
 :
 :That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,
 :And with what imitation you can borrow
S:From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
 :
 :Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
 :
 :Wherein you're happy--which will make him know,
 :
 :If that his head have ear in music--doubtless
 :With joy he will embrace you, for he's honorable
 :And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad:
 :You have me, rich, and I will never fail
 :Beginning nor supplyment.
 :
S:
 :IMOGEN, [taking the cloakbag]  Thou art all the comfort
 :
 :The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away.
 :
 :There's more to be considered, but we'll even
 :
 :All that good time will give us. This attempt
 :I am soldier to, and will abide it with
 :A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
S:
 :
S:PISANIO
 :
 :Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
 :
 :Lest, being missed, I be suspected of
 :
 :Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
 :Here is a box. I had it from the Queen.
 :[He hands her the box.]
S:What's in 't is precious. If you are sick at sea
 :
 :Or stomach-qualmed at land, a dram of this
 :
 :Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
 :
 :And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
 :Direct you to the best.
 :
S:IMOGEN  Amen. I thank thee.
 :
 :[They exit.]

S:Scene 5
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius, Lords, and
 :
S:Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :
 :Thus far, and so farewell.
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS  Thanks, royal sir.
 :
 :My emperor hath wrote I must from hence,
 :
 :And am right sorry that I must report you
 :
 :My master's enemy.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Our subjects, sir,
 :Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself
 :To show less sovereignty than they must needs
 :Appear unkinglike.
S:
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS  So, sir. I desire of you
 :
 :A conduct overland to Milford Haven.--
 :
 :Madam, all joy befall your Grace--and you.
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Lords]
 :My lords, you are appointed for that office.
S:The due of honor in no point omit.--
 :
 :So, farewell, noble Lucius.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS, [to Cloten]  Your hand, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :Receive it friendly, but from this time forth
 :I wear it as your enemy.
 :
 :LUCIUS  Sir, the event
S:Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :
 :Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
 :Till he have crossed the Severn. Happiness!
 :[Exit Lucius and Lords.]
 :
 :QUEEN
 :He goes hence frowning, but it honors us
S:
 :That we have given him cause.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  'Tis all the better.
 :
 :Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
 :How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
 :Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
 :The powers that he already hath in Gallia
S:
 :Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
 :
S:His war for Britain.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  'Tis not sleepy business,
 :
 :But must be looked to speedily and strongly.
 :
 :CYMBELINE
S:Our expectation that it would be thus
 :
 :Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
 :
 :Where is our daughter? She hath not appeared
 :
 :Before the Roman, nor to us hath tendered
S:The duty of the day. She looks us like
 :
 :A thing more made of malice than of duty.
 :
 :We have noted it.--Call her before us, for
 :
 :We have been too slight in sufferance.
 :[An Attendant exits.]
 :
 :QUEEN  Royal sir,
 :Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
 :Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,
S:
 :'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
 :
 :Forbear sharp speeches to her. She's a lady
 :
 :So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
 :
 :And strokes death to her.
 :
 :[Enter Attendant.]
S:
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Where is she, sir? How
 :
 :Can her contempt be answered?
 :
 :
S:ATTENDANT  Please you, sir,
 :
 :Her chambers are all locked, and there's no answer
 :
 :That will be given to th' loud'st noise we make.
 :
 :
S:QUEEN
 :
 :My lord, when last I went to visit her,
 :
 :She prayed me to excuse her keeping close;
 :
 :Whereto constrained by her infirmity,
S:She should that duty leave unpaid to you
 :
 :Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
 :
S:She wished me to make known, but our great court
 :
 :Made me to blame in memory.
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Her doors locked?
 :
S:Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I
 :
 :Fear prove false!	[He exits with Attendant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  Son, I say, follow the King.
 :
 :CLOTEN
S:That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant
 :
S:I have not seen these two days.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN  Go, look after.
 :
 :[Cloten exits.]
 :[Aside.] Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus--
 :He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
 :Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
 :It is a thing most precious. But for her,
 :Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her,
S:
 :Or, winged with fervor of her love, she's flown
 :
 :To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is
 :
S:To death or to dishonor, and my end
 :
 :Can make good use of either. She being down,
 :
 :I have the placing of the British crown.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cloten.]
 :
 :How now, my son?
 :
S:CLOTEN  'Tis certain she is fled.
 :
 :Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
 :
 :Dare come about him.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN, [aside]  All the better. May
 :This night forestall him of the coming day!
S:[Queen exits, with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :
 :I love and hate her, for she's fair and royal,
 :And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
 :Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one
 :The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
S:Outsells them all. I love her therefore, but
 :
 :Disdaining me and throwing favors on
 :
 :The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
 :
 :That what's else rare is choked. And in that point
 :I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
 :To be revenged upon her. For, when fools
 :Shall--
 :
 :[Enter Pisanio.]
S:
 :
 :
 :Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
 :
 :Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
 :
 :Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
 :Thou art straightway with the fiends.
 :[He draws his sword.]
S:
 :
 :PISANIO  O, good my lord--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN
 :Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter--
 :I will not ask again. Close villain,
 :I'll have this secret from thy heart or rip
 :Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus,
S:From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
 :
 :A dram of worth be drawn?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Alas, my lord,
 :How can she be with him? When was she missed?
 :He is in Rome.
 :
 :CLOTEN  Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
 :No farther halting. Satisfy me home
S:
 :What is become of her.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
 :
S:O, my all-worthy lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  All-worthy villain!
 :
 :Discover where thy mistress is at once,
 :At the next word. No more of "worthy lord"!
 :Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
 :Thy condemnation and thy death.
 :
 :PISANIO  Then, sir,
S:
 :This paper is the history of my knowledge
 :
 :Touching her flight.	[He gives Cloten a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Let's see 't. I will pursue her
 :Even to Augustus' throne.
 :
 :PISANIO, [aside]  Or this or perish.
S:She's far enough, and what he learns by this
 :
 :May prove his travail, not her danger.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Humh!
 :
S:PISANIO, [aside]
 :
 :I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
 :
 :Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Sirrah, is this letter true?
 :
 :PISANIO  Sir, as I think.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  It is Posthumus' hand, I know 't. Sirrah, if
 :
 :thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
 :
 :undergo those employments wherein I should
 :have cause to use thee with a serious industry--
 :that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do to perform
 :it directly and truly--I would think thee an honest
S:man. Thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
 :
S:relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
 :
S:
 :
 :PISANIO  Well, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and
 :constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
 :that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not in the
S:course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of
 :
 :mine. Wilt thou serve me?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Sir, I will.
 :
 :CLOTEN  Give me thy hand. Here's my purse. [Gives
 :him money.] Hast any of thy late master's garments
 :in thy possession?
 :
S:
S:PISANIO  I have, my lord, at my lodging the same suit he
 :
 :wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
 :hither. Let it be thy first service. Go.
 :
S:PISANIO  I shall, my lord.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Meet thee at Milford Haven!--I forgot to ask
 :
 :him one thing; I'll remember 't anon. Even there,
 :thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would
 :these garments were come. She said upon a time--
 :the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--
 :that she held the very garment of Posthumus in
 :more respect than my noble and natural person,
S:
 :together with the adornment of my qualities. With
 :
 :that suit upon my back will I ravish her. First, kill
 :
 :him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valor,
 :
S:which will then be a torment to her contempt.
 :
 :He on the ground, my speech of insultment
 :
 :ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath
 :
 :dined--which, as I say, to vex her I will execute
 :in the clothes that she so praised--to the court
 :I'll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath
 :despised me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my
S:revenge.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Pisanio with the clothes.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Be those the garments?
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  Ay, my noble lord.
S:
 :
 :CLOTEN  How long is 't since she went to Milford Haven?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  She can scarce be there yet.
 :
 :CLOTEN  Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the
 :second thing that I have commanded thee. The
 :third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my
S:design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall
 :
 :tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford.
 :
 :Would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
S:PISANIO
 :
 :Thou bidd'st me to my loss, for true to thee
 :
 :Were to prove false, which I will never be,
 :
 :To him that is most true. To Milford go,
 :And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
 :You heavenly blessings, on her. This fool's speed
 :Be crossed with slowness. Labor be his meed.
 :[He exits.]

S:Scene 6
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Imogen alone, dressed as a boy, Fidele.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :
S:I see a man's life is a tedious one.
 :
 :I have tired myself, and for two nights together
 :
 :Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick
 :
S:But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
 :
 :When from the mountain top Pisanio showed thee,
 :
 :Thou wast within a ken. O Jove, I think
 :
 :Foundations fly the wretched--such, I mean,
 :Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
S:I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
 :
 :That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
 :
S:A punishment or trial? Yes. No wonder,
 :
 :When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fullness
 :
S:Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
 :
 :Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord,
 :
S:Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee,
 :
 :My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
 :
 :At point to sink for food. But what is this?
 :
 :Here is a path to 't. 'Tis some savage hold.
 :I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,
 :Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
S:Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever
 :
 :Of hardiness is mother.--Ho! Who's here?
 :
 :If anything that's civil, speak; if savage,
 :
 :Take or lend. Ho!--No answer? Then I'll enter.
S:Best draw my sword; an if mine enemy
 :
S:But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on 't.
 :
 :[She draws her sword.]
 :
 :Such a foe, good heavens!
 :
 :[She exits, as into the cave.]
 :
S:[Enter Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as Polydor, and
 :
 :Arviragus as Cadwal.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :
 :You, Polydor, have proved best woodman and
S:Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
 :
 :Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match.
 :
 :The sweat of industry would dry and die
 :
 :But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs
 :Will make what's homely savory. Weariness
 :Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
 :Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
 :Poor house, that keep'st thyself.
 :
S:
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  I am throughly weary.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :There is cold meat i' th' cave. We'll browse on that
 :
 :Whilst what we have killed be cooked.
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan, looking into the cave]
 :Stay, come
S:not in!
 :
 :But that it eats our victuals, I should think
 :
 :Here were a fairy.
 :
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  What's the matter, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :
S:By Jupiter, an angel! Or, if not,
 :
 :An earthly paragon. Behold divineness
 :
 :No elder than a boy.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Imogen as Fidele.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  Good masters, harm me not.
 :
 :Before I entered here, I called, and thought
 :
 :To have begged or bought what I have took. Good
 :
 :troth,
 :I have stol'n naught, nor would not, though I had
 :found
 :Gold strewed i' th' floor. Here's money for my meat.
 :[She offers money.]
 :I would have left it on the board so soon
S:
 :As I had made my meal, and parted
 :
 :With prayers for the provider.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Money, youth?
 :
S:ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
 :
 :As 'tis no better reckoned but of those
 :
 :Who worship dirty gods.
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  I see you're angry.
S:Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
 :
 :Have died had I not made it.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Whither bound?
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  To Milford Haven.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  What's your name?
 :
S:
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :
S:Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
 :
 :Is bound for Italy. He embarked at Milford,
 :
 :To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
 :
 :I am fall'n in this offense.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Prithee, fair youth,
 :Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
S:By this rude place we live in. Well encountered!
 :
 :'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
 :
 :Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.--
 :
S:Boys, bid him welcome.
 :
S:
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Were you a woman, youth,
 :
 :I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty,
 :
 :Ay, bid for you as I do buy.
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  I'll make 't my comfort
 :He is a man. I'll love him as my brother.--
 :And such a welcome as I'd give to him
 :After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome.
S:
 :Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  'Mongst
 :
 :friends?
 :If brothers--[(aside)] Would it had been so, that they
 :Had been my father's sons! Then had my prize
 :Been less, and so more equal ballasting
 :To thee, Posthumus.
S:
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  He wrings at some distress.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :Would I could free 't!
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Or I, whate'er it be,
 :What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!
 :
S:
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Hark, boys.
 :
 :[They talk aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  Great men
 :That had a court no bigger than this cave,
 :That did attend themselves and had the virtue
 :Which their own conscience sealed them, laying by
 :That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,
S:
 :Could not outpeer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
 :
 :I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
 :
 :Since Leonatus false.
 :
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  It shall be so.
 :
S:Boys, we'll go dress our hunt.--Fair youth, come in.
 :
 :Discourse is heavy, fasting. When we have supped,
 :
 :We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story
 :
 :So far as thou wilt speak it.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Pray, draw near.
 :
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less
 :
 :welcome.
 :
S:IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  Thanks, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  I pray, draw near.

S:[Enter two Roman Senators, and Tribunes.]

 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST SENATOR
 :
 :This is the tenor of the Emperor's writ:
 :
 :That since the common men are now in action
 :'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
 :And that the legions now in Gallia are
 :Full weak to undertake our wars against
 :The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
 :The gentry to this business. He creates
S:
 :Lucius proconsul; and to you the tribunes
 :
S:For this immediate levy, he commends
 :
 :His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
 :
 :
 :
 :TRIBUNE
 :Is Lucius general of the forces?
 :
 :SECOND SENATOR  Ay.
 :
S:TRIBUNE
 :
 :Remaining now in Gallia?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SENATOR  With those legions
S:Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
 :
 :Must be supplyant. The words of your commission
 :
 :Will tie you to the numbers and the time
 :
 :Of their dispatch.
 :

 :[Enter Cloten alone, dressed in Posthumus's garments.]
 :
 :
S:
 :CLOTEN  I am near to th' place where they should meet,
 :
S:if Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
 :
 :serve me! Why should his mistress, who
 :
 :was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit
 :
 :too? The rather, saving reverence of the word, for
 :'tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I
 :must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself,
S:for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to
 :
 :confer in his own chamber. I mean, the lines of my
 :
 :body are as well drawn as his, no less young, more
 :
 :strong; not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him
 :in the advantage of the time, above him in birth,
 :alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable
 :in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant
 :thing loves him in my despite. What
 :mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is
S:
 :growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour
 :
 :be off, thy mistress enforced, thy garments cut to
 :
 :pieces before thy face; and all this done, spurn her
 :
 :home to her father, who may haply be a little angry
 :or my so rough usage. But my mother, having
 :power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations
 :.
 :My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword,
S:
 :and to a sore purpose. Fortune, put them into my
 :
 :hand! This is the very description of their meeting
 :
 :place, and the fellow dares not deceive me.

 :=======
 :[Enter Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as Polydor,
S:
S:Arviragus as Cadwal, and Imogen as Fidele, from the
 :
 :cave.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan, to Fidele]
 :You are not well. Remain here in the cave.
 :We'll come to you after hunting.
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal, to Fidele]  Brother, stay here.
S:
 :Are we not brothers?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  So man and man should be,
 :
 :But clay and clay differs in dignity,
 :Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal]
 :Go you to hunting. I'll abide with him.
S:
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :
 :So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
 :
S:But not so citizen a wanton as
 :
S:To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me.
 :
 :Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom
 :
 :Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
 :
 :Cannot amend me. Society is no comfort
 :To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
 :Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here--
 :I'll rob none but myself--and let me die,
 :Stealing so poorly.
 :
S:
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :I love thee--I have spoke it--
 :
S:How much the quantity, the weight as much
 :
 :As I do love my father.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  What? How, how?
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
 :
 :In my good brother's fault. I know not why
S:I love this youth, and I have heard you say
 :
 :Love's reason's without reason. The bier at door,
 :
S:And a demand who is 't shall die, I'd say
 :
 :"My father, not this youth."
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [aside]  O, noble strain!
 :O, worthiness of nature, breed of greatness!
 :Cowards father cowards and base things sire base;
 :Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
 :I'm not their father, yet who this should be
 :Doth miracle itself, loved before me.--
S:
 :'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
 :
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal, to Fidele]  Brother, farewell.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :I wish you sport.
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  You health.--So please you, sir.
 :
S:IMOGEN, [aside]
 :
S:These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!
 :
 :Our courtiers say all's savage but at court;
 :
 :Experience, O, thou disprov'st report!
 :
 :Th' imperious seas breeds monsters; for the dish
S:Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
 :
 :I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,
 :
 :I'll now taste of thy drug.	[She swallows the drug.]
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal]
 :I could not stir him.
 :He said he was gentle but unfortunate,
S:Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :Thus did he answer me, yet said hereafter
 :I might know more.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  To th' field, to th' field!
 :[To Fidele.] We'll leave you for this time. Go in and
S:rest.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :
 :We'll not be long away.
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Pray, be not sick,
 :
 :For you must be our huswife.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  Well or ill,
S:I am bound to you.
 :
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  And shalt be ever.
 :
 :[Imogen exits as into the cave.]
 :
 :This youth, howe'er distressed, appears he hath had
 :Good ancestors.
 :
S:ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  How angel-like he sings!
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters
S:And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick
 :
 :And he her dieter.
 :
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Nobly he yokes
 :
 :A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
 :
 :Was that it was for not being such a smile,
 :The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
 :From so divine a temple to commix
 :With winds that sailors rail at.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  I do note
 :
 :That grief and patience, rooted in them both,
 :
 :Mingle their spurs together.
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Grow, patience,
S:And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
 :
 :His perishing root with the increasing vine!
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :It is great morning. Come, away. Who's there?
S:
 :
 :[Enter Cloten.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN, [to himself]
 :I cannot find those runagates. That villain
S:Hath mocked me. I am faint.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan, to Polydor and Cadwal]
 :
 :"Those runagates"?
 :Means he not us? I partly know him. 'Tis
 :Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush.
S:I saw him not these many years, and yet
 :
 :I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :He is but one. You and my brother search
 :What companies are near. Pray you, away.
 :Let me alone with him.	[Belarius and Arviragus exit.]
 :
 :CLOTEN  Soft, what are you
S:
 :That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?
 :
 :I have heard of such.--What slave art thou?
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  A thing
 :More slavish did I ne'er than answering
 :A slave without a knock.
 :
S:CLOTEN  Thou art a robber,
 :
 :A lawbreaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
 :
S:
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
S:To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
 :
 :An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?
 :
 :Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
 :
 :My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
S:Why I should yield to thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Thou villain base,
 :
 :Know'st me not by my clothes?
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  No, nor thy tailor,
S:rascal.
 :
 :Who is thy grandfather? He made those clothes,
 :
S:Which, as it seems, make thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Thou precious varlet,
 :
 :My tailor made them not.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Hence then, and thank
S:The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool.
 :
 :I am loath to beat thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Thou injurious thief,
 :Hear but my name, and tremble.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  What's thy name?
 :
 :CLOTEN  Cloten, thou villain.
S:
 :
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
 :
 :I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
 :
 :'Twould move me sooner.
 :
 :CLOTEN  To thy further fear,
 :Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
 :I am son to th' Queen.
 :
S:
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  I am sorry for 't, not seeming
 :
 :So worthy as thy birth.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Art not afeard?
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :Those that I reverence, those I fear--the wise;
 :At fools I laugh, not fear them.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLOTEN  Die the death!
 :
 :When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
 :
 :I'll follow those that even now fled hence
 :And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads.
 :Yield, rustic mountaineer!
 :[They fight and exit.]
 :
S:
 :[Enter Belarius as Morgan and Arviragus as
 :
 :Cadwal.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  No company's abroad?
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]
 :None in the world. You did mistake him sure.
S:
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :
S:I cannot tell. Long is it since I saw him,
 :
S:But time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor
 :
 :Which then he wore. The snatches in his voice
 :
 :And burst of speaking were as his. I am absolute
 :
 :'Twas very Cloten.
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  In this place we left them.
 :I wish my brother make good time with him,
 :You say he is so fell.
 :
S:
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Being scarce made up,
 :
 :I mean to man, he had not apprehension
 :
 :Of roaring terrors; for defect of judgment
 :
 :Is oft the cause of fear.
 :
 :[Enter Guiderius as Polydor, carrying Cloten's head.]
 :
 :But see, thy brother.
S:
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
 :
S:There was no money in 't. Not Hercules
 :
 :Could have knocked out his brains, for he had none.
 :
 :Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
 :
 :My head as I do his.
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  What hast thou done?
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
 :Son to the Queen, after his own report,
 :Who called me traitor mountaineer, and swore
 :With his own single hand he'd take us in,
 :Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they
S:
 :grow,
 :
 :And set them on Lud's Town.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  We are all undone.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
 :But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
S:
 :Protects not us. Then why should we be tender
 :
 :To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
 :
 :Play judge and executioner all himself,
 :
 :For we do fear the law? What company
 :Discover you abroad?
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  No single soul
S:Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason
 :
 :He must have some attendants. Though his humor
 :
 :Was nothing but mutation--ay, and that
 :
 :From one bad thing to worse--not frenzy,
 :Not absolute madness could so far have raved
 :To bring him here alone. Although perhaps
 :It may be heard at court that such as we
 :Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
 :May make some stronger head, the which he
S:
 :hearing--
 :
 :As it is like him--might break out and swear
 :
 :He'd fetch us in, yet is 't not probable
 :
S:To come alone, either he so undertaking
 :
 :Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,
 :
 :If we do fear this body hath a tail
 :
 :More perilous than the head.
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Let ord'nance
 :
 :Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er,
 :
 :My brother hath done well.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  I had no mind
 :To hunt this day. The boy Fidele's sickness
 :Did make my way long forth.
 :
S:
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  With his own sword,
 :
 :Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
 :
 :His head from him. I'll throw 't into the creek
 :
 :Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
 :And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
 :That's all I reck.	[He exits.]
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  I fear 'twill be revenged.
S:
 :Would, Polydor, thou hadst not done 't, though valor
 :
 :Becomes thee well enough.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Would I had done 't,
 :So the revenge alone pursued me. Polydor,
 :I love thee brotherly, but envy much
 :Thou hast robbed me of this deed. I would revenges
 :That possible strength might meet would seek us
S:
 :through
 :
 :And put us to our answer.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Well, 'tis done.
 :We'll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger
S:Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock.
 :
 :You and Fidele play the cooks. I'll stay
 :
 :Till hasty Polydor return, and bring him
 :
 :To dinner presently.
 :
S:ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Poor sick Fidele.
 :
 :I'll willingly to him. To gain his color
 :
 :I'd let a parish of such Clotens blood,
 :
 :And praise myself for charity.	[He exits.]
 :
S:BELARIUS  O thou goddess,
 :
 :Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st
 :
 :In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
 :
 :As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
S:Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
 :
 :Their royal blood enchafed, as the rud'st wind
 :
 :That by the top doth take the mountain pine
 :
 :And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder
 :That an invisible instinct should frame them
 :To royalty unlearned, honor untaught,
S:Civility not seen from other, valor
 :
 :That wildly grows in them but yields a crop
 :
 :As if it had been sowed. Yet still it's strange
 :
 :What Cloten's being here to us portends,
 :Or what his death will bring us.
 :
S:[Enter Guiderius as Polydor.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Where's my brother?
 :I have sent Cloten's clotpole down the stream
 :In embassy to his mother. His body's hostage
 :For his return.	[Solemn music.]
 :
S:BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  My ingenious instrument!
 :
 :Hark, Polydor, it sounds! But what occasion
 :
 :Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark.
 :
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :Is he at home?
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  He went hence even now.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :What does he mean? Since death of my dear'st
 :mother
 :It did not speak before. All solemn things
S:
 :Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
 :
 :Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
 :
 :Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
 :
S:Is Cadwal mad?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Arviragus as Cadwal, with Imogen as dead,
 :
 :bearing her in his arms.]
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Look, here he comes,
 :And brings the dire occasion in his arms
 :Of what we blame him for.
S:
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  The bird is dead
 :
 :That we have made so much on. I had rather
 :
S:Have skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty,
 :
 :To have turned my leaping time into a crutch,
 :
 :Than have seen this.
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  O sweetest, fairest lily!
 :My brother wears thee not the one half so well
S:As when thou grew'st thyself.
 :
 :
 :
S:BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  O melancholy,
 :
 :Whoever yet could sound thy bottom, find
 :
 :The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
 :
 :Might eas'liest harbor in?--Thou blessed thing,
 :Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
S:Thou died'st, a most rare boy, of melancholy.--
 :
 :How found you him?
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Stark, as you see;
 :Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
S:Not as Death's dart being laughed at; his right cheek
 :
 :Reposing on a cushion.
 :
 :
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Where?
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  O' th' floor,
 :
S:His arms thus leagued. I thought he slept, and put
 :
 :My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
 :
 :Answered my steps too loud.
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Why, he but sleeps.
 :If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
 :With female fairies will his tomb be haunted--
 :And worms will not come to thee.
 :
S:
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  With fairest flowers,
 :
 :Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
 :
 :I'll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack
 :
S:The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor
 :
 :The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor
 :
 :The leaf of eglantine whom, not to slander,
 :
 :Out-sweetened not thy breath. The ruddock would
S:With charitable bill--O bill, sore shaming
 :
 :Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
 :
 :Without a monument--bring thee all this,
 :
 :Yea, and furred moss besides, when flowers are none
S:To winter-ground thy corse.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Prithee, have done,
 :
 :And do not play in wench-like words with that
 :Which is so serious. Let us bury him
 :And not protract with admiration what
 :Is now due debt. To th' grave.
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Say, where shall 's lay
S:
 :him?
 :
S:
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :By good Euriphile, our mother.
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Be 't so.
 :And let us, Polydor, though now our voices
 :Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground
 :As once to our mother; use like note and words,
 :Save that "Euriphile" must be "Fidele."
S:
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Cadwal,
 :
 :I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee,
 :
 :For notes of sorrow, out of tune, are worse
S:Than priests and fanes that lie.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  We'll speak it then.
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
S:Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten
 :
 :Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys,
 :
 :And though he came our enemy, remember
 :
 :He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty,
 :Rotting together, have one dust, yet reverence,
 :That angel of the world, doth make distinction
S:Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely,
 :
 :And though you took his life as being our foe,
 :
 :Yet bury him as a prince.
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor, to Morgan]  Pray you fetch him
 :hither.
 :Thersites' body is as good as Ajax'

S:But soft! No bedfellow? O gods and goddesses!

 :For so I thought I was a cave-keeper
 :And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so.
 :'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,

 :Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,

S:

 :Murder in heaven! How? 'Tis gone. Pisanio,

 :And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
 :Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten,
S:

S:From this most bravest vessel of the world

 :Where is thy head? Where's that? Ay me, where's that?

S:And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?

 :
S:

 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :
 :With the next benefit o' th' wind.
 :
 :LUCIUS  This forwardness
S:Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
 :
 :Be mustered; bid the Captains look to 't.--Now, sir,
 :
 :What have you dreamed of late of this war's purpose?
 :
S:
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :Last night the very gods showed me a vision--
 :
 :I fast and prayed for their intelligence--thus:
 :I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, winged
 :From the spongy south to this part of the west,
 :There vanished in the sunbeams, which portends--
 :Unless my sins abuse my divination--
 :Success to th' Roman host.
S:
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS  Dream often so,

 :And never false.--Soft, ho, what trunk is here
 :
S:Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
 :
 :It was a worthy building. How, a page?
 :
 :Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead rather,
 :
 :For nature doth abhor to make his bed
 :With the defunct or sleep upon the dead.
 :Let's see the boy's face.
S:

 :CAPTAIN  He's alive, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :He'll then instruct us of this body.--Young one,
 :Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
 :They crave to be demanded. Who is this
 :Thou mak'st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
S:That, otherwise than noble nature did,
 :
 :Hath altered that good picture? What's thy interest

 :In this sad wrack? How came 't? Who is 't?
 :
 :What art thou?
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  I am nothing; or if not,
 :
 :Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
 :
 :A very valiant Briton, and a good,
 :That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas,
 :There is no more such masters. I may wander
 :From east to occident, cry out for service,
 :Try many, all good, serve truly, never
 :Find such another master.
S:

S:Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than
 :
 :Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.

S:IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :
 :Richard du Champ. [Aside.] If I do lie and do

 :Thou shalt be so well mastered, but be sure
S:No less beloved. The Roman Emperor's letters

S:
 :And rather father thee than master thee.--My friends,
 :
 :The boy hath taught us manly duties. Let us
 :
 :Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
 :
 :And make him with our pikes and partisans
 :A grave. Come, arm him.--Boy, he's preferred
 :By thee to us, and he shall be interred
S:As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.

 :
S:[An Attendant exits.]
 :
 :A fever, with the absence of her son;

 :A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
 :
 :How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
 :The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
 :Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
 :When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
 :So needful for this present. It strikes me past

 :We'll higher to the mountains, there secure us.

 :Among the bands--may drive us to a render
S:Where we have lived, and so extort from 's that
 :
S:Which we have done, whose answer would be death
 :
 :Drawn on with torture.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  This is, sir, a doubt
 :In such a time nothing becoming you
 :Nor satisfying us.
S:
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  It is not likely
 :
 :That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
 :
 :Behold their quartered fires, have both their eyes
 :And ears so cloyed importantly as now,
 :That they will waste their time upon our note,
S:To know from whence we are.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  O, I am known
 :
 :Of many in the army. Many years,
 :Though Cloten then but young, you see not wore him
 :From my remembrance. And besides, the King
 :Hath not deserved my service nor your loves,
 :Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
S:The certainty of this hard life, aye hopeless
 :
 :To have the courtesy your cradle promised,

 :But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
 :
 :The shrinking slaves of winter.
 :

 :Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.
 :I and my brother are not known; yourself

S:
 :Cannot be questioned.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  By this sun that shines,
 :
S:I'll thither. What thing is 't that I never
 :
 :Did see man die, scarce ever looked on blood
 :
S:But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
 :
 :Never bestrid a horse save one that had
 :
S:A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
 :
 :Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
 :
 :To look upon the holy sun, to have
 :
 :The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
 :So long a poor unknown.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  By heavens, I'll go!

 :
 :I'll take the better care, but if you will not,

 :

 :My cracked one to more care. Have with you, boys!

 :No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,

 :The country base than to commit such slaughter,
 :With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
S:Than those for preservation cased or shame--
 :
 :Made good the passage, cried to those that fled

 :"Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.

 :The way that they did and to grin like lions
 :Upon the pikes o' th' hunters. Then began
 :A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
S:A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly
 :
 :Chickens the way which they stooped eagles; slaves
 :
 :The strides they victors made; and now our
 :
 :cowards,
 :Like fragments in hard voyages, became
 :The life o' th' need. Having found the backdoor open
S:Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!

S:LORD
 :
 :Nay, be not angry, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  'Lack, to what end?
S:Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
 :
 :For if he'll do as he is made to do,
 :
S:I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
 :
 :You have put me into rhyme.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD  Farewell. You're angry.
 :[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :
 :Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,
 :
 :To be i' th' field and ask "What news?" of me!
 :Today how many would have given their honors
S:To have saved their carcasses, took heel to do 't,
 :
 :And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charmed,
 :
 :Could not find Death where I did hear him groan,
 :
 :Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
S:'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
 :
 :Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we
 :
 :That draw his knives i' th' war. Well, I will find him;
 :
 :For being now a favorer to the Briton,
S:No more a Briton. [(He removes his peasant
 :
 :costume.)] I have resumed again
 :
S:The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
 :
 :But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
 :
 :Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
 :
 :Here made by th' Roman; great the answer be
 :Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death.
 :On either side I come to spend my breath,
S:Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
 :
 :But end it by some means for Imogen.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter two Briton Captains, and Soldiers.]
 :
 :
 :FIRST CAPTAIN
S:Great Jupiter be praised, Lucius is taken!
 :
 :'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND CAPTAIN
 :There was a fourth man in a silly habit
 :That gave th' affront with them.
 :
S:FIRST CAPTAIN  So 'tis reported,
 :
 :But none of 'em can be found.--Stand. Who's there?
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  A Roman,
 :
 :Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
 :
S:Had answered him.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND CAPTAIN  Lay hands on him. A dog,
 :
 :A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
 :What crows have pecked them here. He brags his
S:service
 :
 :As if he were of note. Bring him to th' King.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cymbeline, Attendants, Belarius as Morgan,
S:Guiderius as Polydor, Arviragus as Cadwal, Pisanio,
 :
 :Soldiers, and Roman captives. The Captains present
 :
 :Posthumus to Cymbeline, who delivers him over to a

 :Scene 4
 :=======
 :[Enter Posthumus in chains, and two Jailers.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :JAILER
 :
S:You shall not now be stol'n; you have locks upon you.
 :
 :So graze as you find pasture.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND JAILER  Ay, or a stomach.
 :[Jailers exit.]
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :Most welcome, bondage, for thou art a way,
 :I think, to liberty. Yet am I better
S:
 :Than one that's sick o' th' gout, since he had rather
 :
 :Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
 :
 :By th' sure physician, Death, who is the key
 :
S:T' unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fettered
 :
 :More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods,
 :
 :give me
 :
 :The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
 :Then free forever. Is 't enough I am sorry?
 :So children temporal fathers do appease;
 :Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
 :I cannot do it better than in gyves,
 :Desired more than constrained. To satisfy,
S:
 :If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
 :
 :No stricter render of me than my all.
 :
 :I know you are more clement than vile men,
 :
S:Who of their broken debtors take a third,
 :
 :A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
 :
 :On their abatement. That's not my desire.
 :
 :For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
 :'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coined it.
 :'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
 :Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;
 :You rather mine, being yours. And so, great powers,
S:If you will take this audit, take this life
 :
 :And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen,
 :
 :I'll speak to thee in silence.	[He lies down and sleeps.]
 :
 :
 :[Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, Sicilius
 :Leonatus, father to Posthumus, an old man attired like
 :a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his
S:wife and mother to Posthumus, with music before
 :
 :them. Then, after other music, follows the two young
 :
 :Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they
 :
 :died in the wars. They circle Posthumus round as he
 :lies sleeping.]
 :
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :No more, thou Thunder-master, show
S:
 :Thy spite on mortal flies.
 :
 :With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
 :
 :That thy adulteries
 :
 :Rates and revenges.
 :Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
 :Whose face I never saw?
S:I died whilst in the womb he stayed,
 :
 :Attending nature's law;
 :
 :Whose father then--as men report
 :
 :Thou orphans' father art--
 :Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
 :From this earth-vexing smart.
 :
 :MOTHER
 :Lucina lent not me her aid,
S:
 :But took me in my throes,
 :
 :That from me was Posthumus ripped,
 :
 :Came crying 'mongst his foes,
 :
 :A thing of pity.
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :Great Nature, like his ancestry,
 :Molded the stuff so fair
S:
 :That he deserved the praise o' th' world
 :
S:As great Sicilius' heir.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST BROTHER
 :
 :When once he was mature for man,
S:In Britain where was he
 :
 :That could stand up his parallel
 :
 :Or fruitful object be
 :
 :In eye of Imogen, that best
 :Could deem his dignity?
 :
 :MOTHER
 :With marriage wherefore was he mocked,
S:To be exiled and thrown
 :
 :From Leonati seat, and cast
 :
 :From her, his dearest one,
 :
 :Sweet Imogen?
S:
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :
S:Why did you suffer Iachimo,
 :
 :Slight thing of Italy,
 :
 :To taint his nobler heart and brain
 :
 :With needless jealousy,
 :And to become the geck and scorn
 :O' th' other's villainy?
S:
 :
 :SECOND BROTHER
 :
 :For this, from stiller seats we came,
 :
 :Our parents and us twain,
 :That striking in our country's cause
 :Fell bravely and were slain,
 :Our fealty and Tenantius' right
 :With honor to maintain.
S:
 :
 :FIRST BROTHER
 :
 :Like hardiment Posthumus hath
 :
 :To Cymbeline performed.
 :Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
 :Why hast thou thus adjourned
 :The graces for his merits due,
 :Being all to dolors turned?
S:
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :
S:Thy crystal window ope; look out.
 :
 :No longer exercise
 :
S:Upon a valiant race thy harsh
 :
 :And potent injuries.
 :
 :
 :
 :MOTHER
 :Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
 :Take off his miseries.
 :
 :SICILIUS
S:Peep through thy marble mansion. Help,
 :
 :Or we poor ghosts will cry
 :
 :To th' shining synod of the rest
 :
 :Against thy deity.
S:
 :
 :BROTHERS
 :
 :Help, Jupiter, or we appeal
 :
 :And from thy justice fly.
 :
 :[Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon
 :an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The Ghosts fall on
 :their knees.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :JUPITER
 :
S:No more, you petty spirits of region low,
 :
 :Offend our hearing! Hush. How dare you ghosts
 :
 :Accuse the Thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
 :
 :Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts.
 :Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
S:Upon your never-withering banks of flowers.
 :
 :Be not with mortal accidents oppressed.
 :
 :No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
 :
 :Whom best I love I cross, to make my gift,
 :The more delayed, delighted. Be content.
 :Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift.
 :His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
 :Our Jovial star reigned at his birth, and in
 :Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
S:
 :He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,
 :
 :And happier much by his affliction made.
 :
 :[He hands Sicilius a tablet.]
 :
 :This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
 :Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine.
 :And so away. No farther with your din
 :Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.--
 :Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.	[Ascends.]
S:
 :
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :
 :He came in thunder. His celestial breath
 :
 :Was sulphurous to smell. The holy eagle
 :Stooped as to foot us. His ascension is
 :More sweet than our blest fields; his royal bird
 :Preens the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
 :As when his god is pleased.
S:
 :
 :
S:ALL  Thanks, Jupiter.
 :
 :
 :
 :SICILIUS
 :
 :The marble pavement closes; he is entered
 :His radiant roof. Away, and, to be blest,
 :Let us with care perform his great behest.
 :[He places the tablet on Posthumus' breast. They vanish.]
 :
 :POSTHUMUS, [waking]
S:
 :Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire and begot
 :
S:A father to me, and thou hast created
 :
 :A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
 :
 :Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.
 :
 :And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
 :On greatness' favor dream as I have done,
 :Wake, and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.
 :Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
 :And yet are steeped in favors; so am I
 :That have this golden chance and know not why.
S:
 :[Finding the tablet.]
 :
 :What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one,
 :
 :Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
 :
 :Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects
 :So follow, to be, most unlike our courtiers,
 :As good as promise.
 :[Reads.]
 :Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
S:
 :without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of
 :
 :tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be
 :
 :lopped branches which, being dead many years, shall
 :
 :after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly
 :grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain
 :be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.
 :'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
 :Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing,
S:
 :Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such
 :
 :As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
 :
 :The action of my life is like it, which
 :
S:I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Jailer.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JAILER  Come, sir, are you ready for death?
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
 :
S:
 :JAILER  Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for
 :
 :that, you are well cooked.
 :
S:
 :
S:POSTHUMUS  So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators,
 :
 :the dish pays the shot.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAILER  A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort
 :
S:is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear
 :
 :no more tavern bills, which are often the sadness
 :
 :of parting as the procuring of mirth. You come in
 :
 :faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
 :much drink; sorry that you have paid too much,
 :and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and
 :brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being
 :too light; the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness.
 :O, of this contradiction you shall now be
S:
 :quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
 :
 :thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and
 :
 :creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come, the
 :
 :discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters;
 :so the acquittance follows.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
S:
 :
 :JAILER  Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
 :
 :toothache. But a man that were to sleep your
 :
 :sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think
 :he would change places with his officer; for, look
 :you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
 :
S:
 :JAILER  Your Death has eyes in 's head, then. I have not
 :
 :seen him so pictured. You must either be directed
 :
 :by some that take upon them to know, or to take
 :
S:upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
 :
 :know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril.
 :
 :And how you shall speed in your journey's end, I
 :
 :think you'll never return to tell one.
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I tell thee, fellow, there are none want
 :
 :eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as
 :
 :wink and will not use them.
 :
 :JAILER  What an infinite mock is this, that a man
 :should have the best use of eyes to see the way of
 :blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner
 :to the King.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Thou bring'st good news. I am called to be
 :made free.
S:
 :
 :
 :JAILER  I'll be hanged then.
 :
 :[He removes Posthumus's chains.]
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Thou shalt be then freer than a jailer. No
 :bolts for the dead.	[All but the Jailer exit.]
S:
 :
 :JAILER  Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget
 :
 :young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
 :
 :conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
 :for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them
S:too that die against their wills. So should I, if I
 :
 :were one. I would we were all of one mind, and
 :
 :one mind good. O, there were desolation of jailers
 :
 :and gallowses! I speak against my present profit,
S:but my wish hath a preferment in 't.
 :
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 5
 :=======
 :[Enter Cymbeline, Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as
S:Polydor, Arviragus as Cadwal, Pisanio, Attendants,
 :
 :and Lords.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal]
 :Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
 :Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
 :That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
 :Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
S:
 :Stepped before targes of proof, cannot be found.
 :
S:He shall be happy that can find him, if
 :
 :Our grace can make him so.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  I never saw
 :Such noble fury in so poor a thing,
S:Such precious deeds in one that promised naught
 :
S:But beggary and poor looks.
 :
 :
 :
S:CYMBELINE  No tidings of him?
 :
 :
 :
S:PISANIO
 :
 :He hath been searched among the dead and living,
 :
 :But no trace of him.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal]
 :To my grief, I am
S:The heir of his reward, which I will add
 :
 :To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,
 :
 :By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
 :
 :To ask of whence you are. Report it.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Sir,
 :In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen.
 :Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
 :Unless I add we are honest.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Bow your knees.
 :
 :[They kneel. He taps their shoulders with his sword.]
 :
 :Arise my knights o' th' battle. I create you
 :Companions to our person, and will fit you
 :With dignities becoming your estates.	[They rise.]
 :
 :[Enter Cornelius and Ladies.]
S:
 :
 :
 :There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
 :
S:Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,
 :
S:And not o' th' court of Britain.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS  Hail, great king.
 :
 :To sour your happiness I must report
 :The Queen is dead.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Who worse than a physician
 :Would this report become? But I consider
 :By med'cine life may be prolonged, yet death
S:
S:Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :
 :With horror, madly dying, like her life,
 :Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
 :Most cruel to herself. What she confessed
 :I will report, so please you. These her women
 :Can trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks
 :Were present when she finished.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Prithee, say.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :First, she confessed she never loved you, only
 :Affected greatness got by you, not you;
 :Married your royalty, was wife to your place,
 :Abhorred your person.
S:
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  She alone knew this,
 :
S:And but she spoke it dying, I would not
 :
S:Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :
S:Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
 :
 :With such integrity, she did confess
 :
S:Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,
 :
 :But that her flight prevented it, she had
 :
 :Ta'en off by poison.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  O, most delicate fiend!
 :Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
S:
 :For you a mortal mineral which, being took,
 :
S:Should by the minute feed on life and, ling'ring,
 :
 :By inches waste you. In which time she purposed,
 :
 :By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
 :
 :O'ercome you with her show and, in time,
S:When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
 :
S:Her son into th' adoption of the crown;
 :
 :But failing of her end by his strange absence,
 :
 :Grew shameless desperate; opened, in despite
 :
S:Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
 :
 :The evils she hatched were not effected; so
 :
 :Despairing died.
 :
 :
S:CYMBELINE  Heard you all this, her women?
 :
 :
 :
 :LADIES  We did, so please your Highness.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Mine eyes
 :Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
 :Mine ears that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
 :That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious
 :To have mistrusted her. Yet, O my daughter,
S:
 :That it was folly in me thou mayst say,
 :
 :And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucius, Iachimo, Soothsayer, and other Roman
 :prisoners, Posthumus Leonatus behind, and Imogen
 :as Fidele, with Briton Soldiers as guards.]
 :
S:Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute. That
 :
 :The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
 :
 :Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit
 :
 :That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
S:Of you their captives, which ourself have granted.
 :
 :So think of your estate.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day
 :Was yours by accident. Had it gone with us,
 :We should not, when the blood was cool, have
 :threatened
 :Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
S:
 :Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
 :
 :May be called ransom, let it come. Sufficeth
 :
 :A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
 :
 :Augustus lives to think on 't; and so much
 :For my peculiar care. This one thing only
 :I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,
 :Let him be ransomed. Never master had
S:A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
 :
 :So tender over his occasions, true,
 :
S:So feat, so nurselike. Let his virtue join
 :
 :With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness
 :
 :Cannot deny. He hath done no Briton harm,
 :
 :Though he have served a Roman. Save him, sir,
 :And spare no blood beside.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  I have surely seen him.
 :His favor is familiar to me.--Boy,
 :Thou hast looked thyself into my grace
S:
 :And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
 :
S:To say "Live, boy." Ne'er thank thy master. Live,
 :
S:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
 :
 :Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it,
 :
 :Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
 :
 :The noblest ta'en.
S:
 :
S:IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  I humbly thank your Highness.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
 :And yet I know thou wilt.
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]  No, no, alack,
 :There's other work in hand. I see a thing
 :Bitter to me as death. Your life, good master,
S:
 :Must shuffle for itself.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  The boy disdains me,
 :
 :He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
 :That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
 :Why stands he so perplexed?
 :[Imogen stares at Iachimo.]
 :
S:
 :CYMBELINE  What would'st thou, boy?
 :
 :I love thee more and more. Think more and more
 :
 :What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on?
 :
 :Speak.
 :Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? Thy friend?
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
S:He is a Roman, no more kin to me
 :
 :Than I to your Highness, who, being born your vassal,
 :
 :Am something nearer.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Wherefore ey'st him so?
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
 :To give me hearing.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Ay, with all my heart,
 :
 :And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele]
 :Fidele, sir.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Thou 'rt my good youth, my page.
S:
 :I'll be thy master. Walk with me. Speak freely.
 :
 :[Cymbeline and Imogen walk aside and talk.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :Is not this boy revived from death?
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  One sand another
 :Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
S:
 :Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  The same dead thing alive.
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :Peace, peace. See further. He eyes us not. Forbear.
 :Creatures may be alike. Were 't he, I am sure
 :He would have spoke to us.
S:
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  But we see him dead.
 :
S:
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]
 :
S:Be silent. Let's see further.
 :
S:
 :
 :PISANIO, [aside]  It is my mistress!
 :
S:Since she is living, let the time run on
 :
 :To good or bad.
 :
 :[Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.]
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Imogen]  Come, stand thou by our side.
 :Make thy demand aloud. [(To Iachimo.)] Sir, step
S:you forth.
 :
 :Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,
 :
 :Or by our greatness and the grace of it,
 :
 :Which is our honor, bitter torture shall
 :Winnow the truth from falsehood.--On. Speak to
 :him.
 :
 :IMOGEN, [as Fidele, pointing to Iachimo's hand]
S:My boon is that this gentleman may render
 :
S:Of whom he had this ring.
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS, [aside]  What's that to him?
 :
 :
S:CYMBELINE
 :
 :That diamond upon your finger, say
 :
 :How came it yours.
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :Thou 'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
 :Which to be spoke would torture thee.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  How? Me?
S:
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO
 :
 :I am glad to be constrained to utter that
 :
 :Which torments me to conceal. By villainy
 :I got this ring. 'Twas Leonatus' jewel,
 :Whom thou didst banish, and--which more may
S:grieve thee,
 :
 :As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
 :
 :'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :All that belongs to this.
 :
 :IACHIMO  That paragon, thy daughter,
 :For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
S:
 :Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.

 :CYMBELINE
 :
S:My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength.
 :
 :I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
 :
 :Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.
 :
 :
S:IACHIMO
 :
 :Upon a time--unhappy was the clock
 :
 :That struck the hour!--it was in Rome--accursed
 :
 :The mansion where!--'twas at a feast--O, would
S:Our viands had been poisoned, or at least
 :
 :Those which I heaved to head!--the good
 :
 :Posthumus--
 :
 :What should I say? He was too good to be
 :Where ill men were, and was the best of all
S:Amongst the rar'st of good ones--sitting sadly,
 :
S:Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
 :
 :For beauty that made barren the swelled boast
 :
S:Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming
 :
 :The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,
 :
 :Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,
 :
 :A shop of all the qualities that man
 :Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
 :Fairness which strikes the eye--
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  I stand on fire.
 :
 :Come to the matter.
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO  All too soon I shall,
 :Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
S:Most like a noble lord in love and one
 :
 :That had a royal lover, took his hint,
 :
 :And, not dispraising whom we praised--therein
 :
 :He was as calm as virtue--he began
 :His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made
 :And then a mind put in 't, either our brags
 :Were cracked of kitchen trulls, or his description
 :Proved us unspeaking sots.
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Nay, nay, to th' purpose.
 :
 :
 :
S:IACHIMO
 :
S:Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
 :
 :He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
 :
 :And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
 :
 :Made scruple of his praise and wagered with him
 :Pieces of gold 'gainst this, which then he wore
 :Upon his honored finger, to attain
 :In suit the place of 's bed and win this ring
 :By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
 :No lesser of her honor confident
S:
 :Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,
 :
 :And would so, had it been a carbuncle
 :
 :Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
 :
 :Been all the worth of 's car. Away to Britain
 :Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
S:Remember me at court, where I was taught
 :
 :Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
 :
 :'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quenched
 :
 :Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
 :Gan in your duller Britain operate
 :Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent.
 :And to be brief, my practice so prevailed
 :That I returned with simular proof enough
 :To make the noble Leonatus mad
S:
 :By wounding his belief in her renown
 :
 :With tokens thus and thus; averring notes
 :
 :Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet--
 :
 :O, cunning how I got it!--nay, some marks
S:Of secret on her person, that he could not
 :
 :But think her bond of chastity quite cracked,
 :
 :I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
 :
 :Methinks I see him now--
 :
 :POSTHUMUS, [coming forward]  Ay, so thou dost,
 :Italian fiend.--Ay me, most credulous fool,
 :Egregious murderer, thief, anything
 :That's due to all the villains past, in being,
S:
S:To come. O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
 :
 :Some upright justicer.--Thou, king, send out
 :
 :For torturers ingenious. It is I
 :
 :That all th' abhorred things o' th' Earth amend
S:By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
 :
 :That killed thy daughter--villainlike, I lie--
 :
S:That caused a lesser villain than myself,
 :
 :A sacrilegious thief, to do 't. The temple
 :
S:Of virtue was she, yea, and she herself.
 :
 :Spit and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
 :
S:The dogs o' th' street to bay me. Every villain
 :
 :Be called Posthumus Leonatus, and
 :
 :Be villainy less than 'twas. O Imogen!
 :
 :My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
 :Imogen, Imogen!
 :
 :IMOGEN, [running to Posthumus]  Peace, my lord!
 :Hear, hear--
 :
S:
 :POSTHUMUS
 :
 :Shall 's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
 :
 :There lie thy part.	[He pushes her away; she falls.]
 :
 :
 :PISANIO  O, gentlemen, help!--
S:Mine and your mistress! O my lord Posthumus,
 :
 :You ne'er killed Imogen till now! Help, help!
 :
 :Mine honored lady--
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Does the world go round?
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :How comes these staggers on me?
 :
S:
S:PISANIO  Wake, my mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :
 :If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
 :To death with mortal joy.
 :
 :PISANIO  How fares my mistress?
 :
 :IMOGEN  O, get thee from my sight!
S:
 :Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence.
 :
 :Breathe not where princes are.
 :
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  The tune of Imogen!
 :
 :
 :
 :PISANIO
S:Lady, the gods throw stones of sulfur on me if
 :
 :That box I gave you was not thought by me
 :
 :A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE
 :New matter still.
S:
 :
 :IMOGEN  It poisoned me.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS  O gods!
 :[To Pisanio.] I left out one thing which the Queen
 :confessed,
 :Which must approve thee honest. "If Pisanio
 :Have," said she, "given his mistress that confection
 :Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
S:
 :As I would serve a rat."
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  What's this, Cornelius?
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :The Queen, sir, very oft importuned me
 :To temper poisons for her, still pretending
 :The satisfaction of her knowledge only
S:
 :In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
 :
S:Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
 :
 :Was of more danger, did compound for her
 :
 :A certain stuff which, being ta'en, would cease
 :
 :The present power of life, but in short time
S:All offices of nature should again
 :
 :Do their due functions.--Have you ta'en of it?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN
 :Most like I did, for I was dead.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus]  My
 :boys,
 :There was our error.
S:
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  This is sure Fidele.
 :
 :
 :
S:IMOGEN, [to Posthumus]
 :
S:Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
 :
 :Think that you are upon a rock, and now
 :
S:Throw me again.	[She embraces him.]
 :
 :
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Hang there like fruit, my soul,
 :
 :Till the tree die.
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Imogen]  How now, my flesh, my child?
S:What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this act?
 :
 :Wilt thou not speak to me?
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [kneeling]  Your blessing, sir.
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus]
 :Though you did love this youth, I blame you not.
 :You had a motive for 't.
 :
S:
 :CYMBELINE, [to Imogen]  My tears that fall
 :
 :Prove holy water on thee. Imogen,
 :
 :Thy mother's dead.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  I am sorry for 't, my lord.
 :[She rises.]
 :
 :CYMBELINE
S:
 :O, she was naught, and long of her it was
 :
 :That we meet here so strangely. But her son
 :
 :Is gone, we know not how nor where.
 :
 :
S:PISANIO  My lord,
 :
 :Now fear is from me, I'll speak truth. Lord Cloten,
 :
 :Upon my lady's missing, came to me
 :
S:With his sword drawn, foamed at the mouth, and
 :
 :swore,
 :
 :If I discovered not which way she was gone,
 :
 :It was my instant death. By accident,
 :I had a feigned letter of my master's
 :Then in my pocket, which directed him
S:To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
 :
 :Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
 :
S:Which he enforced from me, away he posts
 :
 :With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
 :
 :My lady's honor. What became of him
 :
 :I further know not.
 :
S:GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Let me end the story.
 :
 :I slew him there.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Marry, the gods forfend!
 :I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
 :Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
 :Deny 't again.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  I have spoke it, and I did it.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  He was a prince.
 :
S:
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :
 :A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
 :
 :Were nothing princelike, for he did provoke me
S:With language that would make me spurn the sea
 :
 :If it could so roar to me. I cut off 's head,
 :
 :And am right glad he is not standing here
 :
 :To tell this tale of mine.
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  I am sorrow for thee.
 :
 :By thine own tongue thou art condemned and must
 :
 :Endure our law. Thou 'rt dead.
 :
 :IMOGEN  That headless man
 :I thought had been my lord.
 :
S:CYMBELINE  Bind the offender,
 :
 :And take him from our presence.
 :
 :[Attendants bind Guiderius.]
 :
S:
 :
S:BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Stay, sir king.
 :
 :This man is better than the man he slew,
 :
 :As well descended as thyself, and hath
 :
 :More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
S:Had ever scar for.--Let his arms alone.
 :
 :They were not born for bondage.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Why, old soldier,
 :Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
 :By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
 :As good as we?
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  In that he spake too far.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE, [to Morgan]
 :
 :And thou shalt die for 't.
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  We will die all three
 :But I will prove that two on 's are as good
S:As I have given out him.--My sons, I must
 :
 :For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
 :
 :Though haply well for you.
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Your danger's ours.
 :
 :GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]
 :And our good his.
 :
S:
 :BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  Have at it, then.--By leave,
 :
 :Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
 :
 :Was called Belarius.
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  What of him? He is
 :A banished traitor.
 :
 :BELARIUS  He it is that hath
S:
 :Assumed this age; indeed a banished man,
 :
 :I know not how a traitor.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Take him hence.
S:The whole world shall not save him.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS  Not too hot.
 :
 :First pay me for the nursing of thy sons
 :And let it be confiscate all, so soon
 :As I have received it.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Nursing of my sons?
 :
S:
S:BELARIUS
 :
 :I am too blunt and saucy. Here's my knee.
 :
 :[He kneels.]
 :
S:Ere I arise I will prefer my sons,
 :
 :Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
 :
 :These two young gentlemen that call me father
 :
 :And think they are my sons are none of mine.
 :They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
 :And blood of your begetting.
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  How? My issue?
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS
 :So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
S:Am that Belarius whom you sometime banished.
 :
S:Your pleasure was my mere offense, my punishment
 :
 :Itself, and all my treason. That I suffered
 :
 :Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
 :
 :For such and so they are--these twenty years
 :Have I trained up; those arts they have as I
 :Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as
 :Your Highness knows. Their nurse Euriphile,
 :Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
 :Upon my banishment. I moved her to 't,
S:
 :Having received the punishment before
 :
 :For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
 :
 :Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
 :
S:The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
 :
 :Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
 :
 :Here are your sons again, and I must lose
 :
 :Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
 :The benediction of these covering heavens
 :Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthy
S:To inlay heaven with stars.	[He weeps.]
 :
 :
 :
S:CYMBELINE  Thou weep'st and speak'st.
 :
 :The service that you three have done is more
 :
 :Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children.
 :
 :If these be they, I know not how to wish
S:A pair of worthier sons.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS  Be pleased awhile.
 :
S:This gentleman whom I call Polydor,
 :
 :Most worthy prince, as yours is true Guiderius;
 :
 :This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
 :
 :Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapped
 :In a most curious mantle, wrought by th' hand
S:Of his queen mother, which for more probation
 :
 :I can with ease produce.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Guiderius had
S:Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star.
 :
 :It was a mark of wonder.
 :
 :
 :
 :BELARIUS  This is he,
 :Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
 :It was wise Nature's end in the donation
 :To be his evidence now.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  O, what am I,
S:
 :A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
 :
 :Rejoiced deliverance more.--Blest pray you be,
 :
 :That after this strange starting from your orbs,
 :
S:You may reign in them now.--O Imogen,
 :
 :Thou hast lost by this a kingdom!
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN  No, my lord.
 :I have got two worlds by 't.--O my gentle brothers,
 :Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
 :But I am truest speaker. You called me "brother"
 :When I was but your sister; I you "brothers"
 :When we were so indeed.
S:
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Did you e'er meet?
 :
 :
 :
S:ARVIRAGUS
 :
 :Ay, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :GUIDERIUS  And at first meeting loved,
S:Continued so until we thought he died.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORNELIUS
 :
 :By the Queen's dram she swallowed.
 :
S:CYMBELINE, [to Imogen]  O, rare instinct!
 :
S:When shall I hear all through? This fierce
 :
 :abridgment
 :
S:Hath to it circumstantial branches which
 :
 :Distinction should be rich in. Where, how lived you?
 :
 :And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
 :
 :How parted with your brothers? How first met
 :them?
 :Why fled you from the court? And whither?
S:[To Belarius.] These,
 :
 :And your three motives to the battle, with
 :
 :I know not how much more, should be demanded,
 :
 :And all the other by-dependences
 :From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place
 :Will serve our long interrogatories. See,
 :Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
 :And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
 :On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
S:
 :Each object with a joy; the counterchange
 :
S:Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
 :
 :And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
 :
 :Thou art my brother, so we'll hold thee ever.
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [to Belarius]
 :You are my father too, and did relieve me
 :To see this gracious season.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  All o'erjoyed
S:
 :Save these in bonds; let them be joyful too,
 :
 :For they shall taste our comfort.
 :
 :
 :
 :IMOGEN, [to Lucius]  My good master,
 :I will yet do you service.
 :
 :LUCIUS  Happy be you!
 :
S:
S:CYMBELINE
 :
 :The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought,
 :
 :He would have well becomed this place and graced
 :
 :The thankings of a king.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  I am, sir,
 :The soldier that did company these three
 :In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
 :The purpose I then followed. That I was he,
S:
 :Speak, Iachimo. I had you down and might
 :
 :Have made you finish.
 :
 :
 :
 :IACHIMO, [kneeling]  I am down again,
 :But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
 :As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
 :Which I so often owe; but your ring first,
 :And here the bracelet of the truest princess
S:
 :That ever swore her faith.
 :
 :[He holds out the ring and bracelet.]
 :
S:
 :
 :POSTHUMUS  Kneel not to me.
 :
S:The power that I have on you is to spare you;
 :
 :The malice towards you to forgive you. Live
 :
S:And deal with others better.
 :
 :
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Nobly doomed.
 :
 :We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law:
S:Pardon's the word to all.	[Iachimo rises.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ARVIRAGUS, [to Posthumus]  You holp us, sir,
 :
 :As you did mean indeed to be our brother.
 :Joyed are we that you are.
 :
 :POSTHUMUS
 :Your servant, princes.--Good my lord of Rome,
 :Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought
S:
 :Great Jupiter upon his eagle backed
 :
 :Appeared to me, with other spritely shows
 :
 :Of mine own kindred. When I waked, I found
 :
S:This label on my bosom, whose containing
 :
 :Is so from sense in hardness that I can
 :
 :Make no collection of it. Let him show
 :
 :His skill in the construction.
 :
 :LUCIUS  Philarmonus!
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER, [coming forward]
S:Here, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  Read, and declare the meaning.
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER [reads.]  Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to
 :himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced
 :by a piece of tender air; and when from a
 :stately cedar shall be lopped branches which, being
S:dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the
 :
 :old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus
 :
 :end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish
 :
 :in peace and plenty.
 :Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp.
 :The fit and apt construction of thy name,
 :Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.
 :[To Cymbeline.] The piece of tender air thy virtuous
S:daughter,
 :
 :Which we call "mollis aer," and "mollis aer"
 :
 :We term it "mulier," which "mulier" I divine
 :
 :Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
S:Answering the letter of the oracle,
 :
 :[To Posthumus] Unknown to you, unsought, were
 :
 :clipped about
 :
 :With this most tender air.
S:
 :
 :CYMBELINE  This hath some seeming.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
S:The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
 :
S:Personates thee; and thy lopped branches point
 :
 :Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol'n,
 :
 :For many years thought dead, are now revived,
 :
 :To the majestic cedar joined, whose issue
 :Promises Britain peace and plenty.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Well,
S:My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
 :
 :Although the victor, we submit to Caesar
 :
 :And to the Roman Empire, promising
 :
 :To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
 :We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,
 :Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
 :Have laid most heavy hand.
S:
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :The fingers of the powers above do tune
 :
 :The harmony of this peace. The vision
 :Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
 :Of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant
 :Is full accomplished. For the Roman eagle,
 :From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
 :Lessened herself and in the beams o' th' sun
S:
S:So vanished; which foreshowed our princely eagle,
 :
 :Th' imperial Caesar, should again unite
 :
 :His favor with the radiant Cymbeline,
 :
 :Which shines here in the west.
 :
 :CYMBELINE  Laud we the gods,
S:And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
 :
 :From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
 :
 :To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let
 :
 :A Roman and a British ensign wave
 :Friendly together. So through Lud's Town march,
 :And in the temple of great Jupiter
S:Our peace we'll ratify, seal it with feasts.
 :
 :Set on there. Never was a war did cease,
 :
 :Ere bloody hands were washed, with such a peace.
 :
 :[They exit.]
