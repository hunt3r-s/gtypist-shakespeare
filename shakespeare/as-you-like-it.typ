 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Orlando and Adam.]
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  As I remember, Adam, it was upon this
 :fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand
 :crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother on
S:
S:his blessing to breed me well. And there begins my
 :
S:sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
 :
S:report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he
 :
 :keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
 :
 :properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
 :
 :that "keeping," for a gentleman of my birth, that
S:differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
 :
 :bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their
 :
 :feeding, they are taught their manage and, to that
 :
 :end, riders dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain
S:nothing under him but growth, for the which his
 :
S:animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
 :
 :as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives
 :
 :me, the something that nature gave me his countenance
 :
 :seems to take from me. He lets me feed with
 :his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as
S:much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
 :
 :education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the
 :
S:spirit of my father, which I think is within me,
 :
 :begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no
 :
 :longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy
 :
 :how to avoid it.
 :
 :[Enter Oliver.]
 :
 :
 :ADAM  Yonder comes my master, your brother.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he
 :
 :will shake me up.	[Adam steps aside.]
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVER  Now, sir, what make you here?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.
 :
 :OLIVER  What mar you then, sir?
 :
 :ORLANDO  Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that
 :which God made, a poor unworthy brother of
S:
 :yours, with idleness.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught
 :
 :awhile.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with
 :them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I
S:should come to such penury?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Know you where you are, sir?
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.
S:
 :
 :OLIVER  Know you before whom, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I
 :know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle
 :condition of blood you should so know me. The
 :courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you
S:are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not
 :
 :away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt
 :
 :us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I
 :
 :confess your coming before me is nearer to his
 :reverence.
S:
 :
 :OLIVER, [threatening Orlando]  What, boy!
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO, [holding off Oliver by the throat]  Come,
 :come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
 :
 :OLIVER  Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
 :
 :ORLANDO  I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir
S:
 :Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is
 :
 :thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.
 :
 :Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this
 :
 :hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out
 :thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast railed on thyself.
 :
 :ADAM, [coming forward]  Sweet masters, be patient. For
 :your father's remembrance, be at accord.
S:
 :
 :
 :OLIVER, [to Orlando]  Let me go, I say.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My
S:father charged you in his will to give me good
 :
 :education. You have trained me like a peasant,
 :
S:obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
 :
 :qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
 :
 :me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow
 :
 :me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
S:give me the poor allottery my father left me by
 :
 :testament. With that I will go buy my fortunes.
 :
 :[Orlando releases Oliver.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  And what wilt thou do--beg when that is
 :spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be
S:troubled with you. You shall have some part of your
 :
 :will. I pray you leave me.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I will no further offend you than becomes
 :me for my good.
 :
 :OLIVER, [to Adam]  Get you with him, you old dog.
 :
 :ADAM  Is "old dog" my reward? Most true, I have lost
S:
 :my teeth in your service. God be with my old
 :
 :master. He would not have spoke such a word.
 :
 :[Orlando and Adam exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVER  Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I
 :
 :will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
 :
 :crowns neither.--Holla, Dennis!
 :
 :[Enter Dennis.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:DENNIS  Calls your Worship?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Was not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to
 :
 :speak with me?
 :
 :DENNIS  So please you, he is here at the door and
S:importunes access to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Call him in. [Dennis exits.] 'Twill be a good
 :
 :way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Charles.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES  Good morrow to your Worship.
 :
 :OLIVER  Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news
 :at the new court?
 :
S:
 :CHARLES  There's no news at the court, sir, but the old
 :
 :news. That is, the old duke is banished by his
 :
 :younger brother the new duke, and three or four
 :
 :loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
 :exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich
 :the new duke. Therefore he gives them good leave
 :to wander.
 :
S:
 :OLIVER  Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter,
 :
S:be banished with her father?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARLES  O, no, for the Duke's daughter her cousin so
 :
 :loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
 :that she would have followed her exile or have
 :died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no
S:less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter,
 :
 :and never two ladies loved as they do.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Where will the old duke live?
 :
 :CHARLES  They say he is already in the Forest of Arden,
 :and a many merry men with him; and there they
 :live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say
 :many young gentlemen flock to him every day and
S:
 :fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden
 :
 :world.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new
 :duke?
 :
 :CHARLES  Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you
S:with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
 :
 :that your younger brother Orlando hath a
 :
 :disposition to come in disguised against me to try a
 :
 :fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he
 :that escapes me without some broken limb shall
 :acquit him well. Your brother is but young and
 :tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil
 :him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.
 :Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to
S:
 :acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him
 :
 :from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well
 :
S:as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own
 :
 :search and altogether against my will.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
 :thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
 :myself notice of my brother's purpose herein, and
 :have by underhand means labored to dissuade him
 :from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles, it is
 :the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of
S:
S:ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good
 :
 :parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me
 :
S:his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I
 :
 :had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
 :
 :And thou wert best look to 't, for if thou dost him
 :
S:any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
 :
 :himself on thee, he will practice against thee by
 :
 :poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device,
 :
 :and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by
 :some indirect means or other. For I assure thee--
 :and almost with tears I speak it--there is not one so
 :young and so villainous this day living. I speak but
S:brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to
 :
 :thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must
 :
 :look pale and wonder.
 :
 :
 :CHARLES  I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he
 :come tomorrow, I'll give him his payment. If ever
 :he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more.
 :And so God keep your Worship.
S:
 :
 :OLIVER  Farewell, good Charles.	[Charles exits.]
 :
 :Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an
 :
 :end of him, for my soul--yet I know not why--
 :hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
S:schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all
 :
 :sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in
 :
 :the heart of the world, and especially of my own
 :
 :people, who best know him, that I am altogether
 :misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
S:shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the
 :
 :boy thither, which now I'll go about.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter Rosalind and Celia.]
 :
 :
S:
 :CELIA  I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am
 :
S:mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
 :
 :Unless you could teach me to forget a banished
 :
 :father, you must not learn me how to remember
 :
 :any extraordinary pleasure.
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full
 :
 :weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished
 :
 :father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father,
 :so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught
 :my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou,
 :if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
 :tempered as mine is to thee.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND  Well, I will forget the condition of my estate
 :
 :to rejoice in yours.
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  You know my father hath no child but I, nor
 :
 :none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou
 :
S:shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from
 :
 :thy father perforce, I will render thee again in
 :
 :affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break
 :
 :that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet
 :Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
 :
S:ROSALIND  From henceforth I will, coz, and devise
 :
 :sports. Let me see--what think you of falling in
 :
S:love?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but
 :
 :love no man in good earnest, nor no further in
 :sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou
 :mayst in honor come off again.
 :
 :ROSALIND  What shall be our sport, then?
 :
S:
 :CELIA  Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune
 :
 :from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be
 :
 :bestowed equally.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  I would we could do so, for her benefits are
 :mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
 :doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
S:
 :
 :CELIA  'Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce
 :
 :makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
 :
 :makes very ill-favoredly.
 :
S:ROSALIND  Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
 :
 :Nature's. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in
 :
 :the lineaments of nature.
 :
 :
 :CELIA  No? When Nature hath made a fair creature,
 :may she not by fortune fall into the fire?
 :
 :[Enter Touchstone.]
 :
S:
 :Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune,
 :
 :hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the
 :
 :argument?
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature,
 :when Fortune makes Nature's natural the
 :cutter-off of Nature's wit.
 :
S:
 :CELIA  Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither,
 :
 :but Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too
 :
 :dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent
 :
 :this natural for our whetstone, for always the dullness
S:of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. [To
 :
 :Touchstone.] How now, wit, whither wander you?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Mistress, you must come away to your
 :father.
 :
 :CELIA  Were you made the messenger?
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come
S:
 :for you.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Where learned you that oath, fool?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Of a certain knight that swore by his
S:honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his
 :
 :honor the mustard was naught. Now, I'll stand to it,
 :
 :the pancakes were naught and the mustard was
 :
 :good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
 :
 :CELIA  How prove you that in the great heap of your
 :knowledge?
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Stand you both forth now: stroke your
 :chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
 :
 :CELIA  By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.
 :
S:But if you swear by that that is not, you are not
 :
 :forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his
 :
 :honor, for he never had any, or if he had, he had
 :
 :sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or
S:that mustard.
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Prithee, who is 't that thou mean'st?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
 :
S:CELIA  My father's love is enough to honor him.
 :
 :Enough. Speak no more of him; you'll be whipped
 :
 :for taxation one of these days.
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  The more pity that fools may not speak
 :wisely what wise men do foolishly.
 :
 :CELIA  By my troth, thou sayest true. For, since the little
 :wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
S:
 :that wise men have makes a great show. Here
 :
S:comes Monsieur Le Beau.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Le Beau.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  With his mouth full of news.
 :
 :CELIA  Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their
S:young.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  Then shall we be news-crammed.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  All the better. We shall be the more
 :
 :marketable.--Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What's
 :the news?
 :
S:LE BEAU  Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Sport? Of what color?
 :
 :
S:LE BEAU  What color, madam? How shall I answer you?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  As wit and fortune will.
 :
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  Or as the destinies decrees.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Nay, if I keep not my rank--
 :
 :ROSALIND  Thou losest thy old smell.
 :
 :LE BEAU  You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of
S:
 :good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU  I will tell you the beginning, and if it please
 :your Ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is
 :yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming
S:to perform it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU  There comes an old man and his three sons--
 :
 :CELIA  I could match this beginning with an old tale.
 :
 :LE BEAU  Three proper young men of excellent growth
S:
 :and presence.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  With bills on their necks: "Be it known unto
 :
 :all men by these presents."
 :
 :LE BEAU  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles,
 :the Duke's wrestler, which Charles in a moment
S:threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is
 :
 :little hope of life in him. So he served the second,
 :
 :and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man
 :
 :their father making such pitiful dole over them that
S:all the beholders take his part with weeping.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Alas!
 :
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  But what is the sport, monsieur, that the
 :
 :ladies have lost?
 :
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU  Why, this that I speak of.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is
 :the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was
 :sport for ladies.
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Or I, I promise thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  But is there any else longs to see this broken
 :music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon
S:rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
 :
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU  You must if you stay here, for here is the place
 :
S:appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
 :
 :perform it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay
 :and see it.
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando,
 :Charles, and Attendants.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK  Come on. Since the youth will not be
 :
 :entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [to Le Beau]  Is yonder the man?
 :
 :
 :
S:LE BEAU  Even he, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK  How now, daughter and cousin? Are
 :you crept hither to see the wrestling?
 :
 :ROSALIND  Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
 :
S:
S:DUKE FREDERICK  You will take little delight in it, I can
 :
 :tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
 :
 :challenger's youth, I would fain dissuade him, but
 :
 :he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
 :you can move him.
 :
 :CELIA  Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK  Do so. I'll not be by.
S:
 :[He steps aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU, [to Orlando]  Monsieur the challenger, the
 :
 :Princess calls for you.
 :
S:ORLANDO  I attend them with all respect and duty.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  Young man, have you challenged Charles the
 :
 :wrestler?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  No, fair princess. He is the general challenger.
 :I come but in as others do, to try with him the
 :strength of my youth.
 :
 :CELIA  Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
S:your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
 :
 :strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew
 :
 :yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure
 :
 :would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.
 :We pray you for your own sake to embrace your
 :own safety and give over this attempt.
 :
 :ROSALIND  Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not
 :therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to
S:
 :the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
 :
 :thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
 :so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your
 :fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,
 :wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that
 :was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is

 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more
 :modest working.

 :

S:CHARLES  No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat

 :LE BEAU  He cannot speak, my lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK  Bear him away.
 :
 :[Charles is carried off by Attendants.]
 :
 :What is thy name, young man?
 :
 :ORLANDO  Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir
 :Rowland de Boys.
S:
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK
 :
 :I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
 :
 :The world esteemed thy father honorable,
 :But I did find him still mine enemy.
 :Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this
 :deed
 :Hadst thou descended from another house.
S:But fare thee well. Thou art a gallant youth.
 :
 :I would thou hadst told me of another father.
 :
 :[Duke exits with Touchstone, Le Beau,

S:
 :
 :CELIA, [to Rosalind]
 :
 :Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO
 :
 :I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
 :
 :His youngest son, and would not change that calling
 :
S:To be adopted heir to Frederick.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [to Celia]
 :
 :My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
 :And all the world was of my father's mind.
 :Had I before known this young man his son,
 :I should have given him tears unto entreaties
 :Ere he should thus have ventured.
 :
S:
 :CELIA  Gentle cousin,
 :
 :Let us go thank him and encourage him.
 :
 :My father's rough and envious disposition
 :
S:Sticks me at heart.--Sir, you have well deserved.
 :
 :If you do keep your promises in love
 :
 :But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
 :
S:Your mistress shall be happy.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [giving Orlando a chain from her neck]
 :
 :Gentleman,
 :Wear this for me--one out of suits with Fortune,
 :That could give more but that her hand lacks
 :means.--
 :Shall we go, coz?
 :
S:
 :CELIA  Ay.--Fare you well, fair gentleman.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO, [aside]
 :
 :Can I not say "I thank you"? My better parts
 :
 :Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
 :Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [to Celia]
 :He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.
 :I'll ask him what he would.--Did you call, sir?
S:
 :Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
 :
 :More than your enemies.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Will you go, coz?
 :
 :ROSALIND  Have with you. [To Orlando.] Fare you well.
 :[Rosalind and Celia exit.]
 :
S:
 :ORLANDO

 :What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
 :
 :I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
 :
 :O poor Orlando! Thou art overthrown.
 :Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

 :[Enter Le Beau.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LE BEAU
 :
 :Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
 :To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
 :High commendation, true applause, and love,
 :Yet such is now the Duke's condition
 :That he misconsters all that you have done.
S:The Duke is humorous. What he is indeed
 :
 :More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :I thank you, sir, and pray you tell me this:
 :Which of the two was daughter of the duke
 :That here was at the wrestling?
 :
 :LE BEAU
S:
 :Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,
 :
 :But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.
 :
 :The other is daughter to the banished duke,
 :
 :And here detained by her usurping uncle
 :To keep his daughter company, whose loves
 :Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
 :But I can tell you that of late this duke
 :Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
S:
 :Grounded upon no other argument
 :
 :But that the people praise her for her virtues
 :
 :And pity her for her good father's sake;
 :
 :And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
 :Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
 :Hereafter, in a better world than this,
 :I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :
 :I rest much bounden to you. Fare you well.
 :
 :[Le Beau exits.]
 :Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,
 :From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.
 :But heavenly Rosalind!

 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Celia and Rosalind.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Why, cousin! Why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy,
 :not a word?
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Not one to throw at a dog.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  No, thy words are too precious to be cast away
 :upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame
 :me with reasons.
 :
 :ROSALIND  Then there were two cousins laid up, when
 :the one should be lamed with reasons, and the
S:
S:other mad without any.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  But is all this for your father?
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  No, some of it is for my child's father. O,
 :how full of briers is this working-day world!
 :
S:CELIA  They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
 :
S:holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths,
 :
S:our very petticoats will catch them.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  I could shake them off my coat. These burs
 :
 :are in my heart.
 :
 :CELIA  Hem them away.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  I would try, if I could cry "hem" and have
 :
 :him.
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
 :
 :ROSALIND  O, they take the part of a better wrestler
 :than myself.
 :
S:
 :CELIA  O, a good wish upon you. You will try in time, in
 :
 :despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of
 :
 :service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on
 :
S:such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking
 :
 :with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  The Duke my father loved his father dearly.
 :
 :CELIA  Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his
 :son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him,
 :for my father hated his father dearly. Yet I hate not
 :Orlando.
S:
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
 :
 :
 :
S:CELIA  Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Let me love him for that, and do you love
 :
 :him because I do.
 :
 :[Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.]
 :
 :Look, here comes the Duke.
S:
 :
 :CELIA  With his eyes full of anger.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK, [to Rosalind]
 :Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
 :And get you from our court.
 :
 :ROSALIND  Me, uncle?
 :
S:
 :DUKE FREDERICK  You, cousin.
 :
 :Within these ten days if that thou beest found
 :
 :So near our public court as twenty miles,
 :
 :Thou diest for it.
 :
 :ROSALIND  I do beseech your Grace,
 :Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
S:If with myself I hold intelligence
 :
 :Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
 :
 :If that I do not dream or be not frantic--
 :
 :As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
 :Never so much as in a thought unborn
 :Did I offend your Highness.
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK  Thus do all traitors.
 :If their purgation did consist in words,
S:
 :They are as innocent as grace itself.
 :
 :Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND
S:Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
 :
 :Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK
 :Thou art thy father's daughter. There's enough.
 :
 :ROSALIND
S:So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.
 :
 :So was I when your Highness banished him.
 :
 :Treason is not inherited, my lord,
 :
 :Or if we did derive it from our friends,
 :What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
 :Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
 :To think my poverty is treacherous.
 :
S:CELIA  Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK
 :
 :Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake;
 :Else had she with her father ranged along.
 :
 :CELIA
 :I did not then entreat to have her stay.
S:It was your pleasure and your own remorse.
 :
 :I was too young that time to value her,
 :
 :But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
 :
 :Why, so am I. We still have slept together,
 :Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,
S:And, wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans
 :
 :Still we went coupled and inseparable.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK
 :She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,
 :Her very silence, and her patience
 :Speak to the people, and they pity her.
S:Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,
 :
 :And thou wilt show more bright and seem more
 :
 :virtuous
 :
 :When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
 :Firm and irrevocable is my doom
 :Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.
 :
 :CELIA
 :Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
S:
 :I cannot live out of her company.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE FREDERICK
 :
 :You are a fool.--You, niece, provide yourself.
 :If you outstay the time, upon mine honor
 :And in the greatness of my word, you die.
 :[Duke and Lords exit.]
 :
S:
 :CELIA
 :
 :O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
 :
 :Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
 :
 :I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  I have more cause.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Thou hast not, cousin.
 :Prithee, be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
 :Hath banished me, his daughter?
 :
 :ROSALIND  That he hath not.
 :
S:
 :CELIA
 :
 :No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
 :
S:Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
 :
 :Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?
 :
 :No, let my father seek another heir.
 :
 :Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
 :Whither to go, and what to bear with us,
 :And do not seek to take your change upon you,
 :To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.
 :For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
S:Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Why, whither shall we go?
 :
 :
 :CELIA
 :To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
 :
 :ROSALIND
 :Alas, what danger will it be to us,
S:
 :Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
 :
 :Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA
 :I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
 :And with a kind of umber smirch my face.
 :The like do you. So shall we pass along
S:And never stir assailants.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Were it not better,
 :
 :Because that I am more than common tall,
S:That I did suit me all points like a man?
 :
 :A gallant curtal-ax upon my thigh,
 :
 :A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart
 :
 :Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will,
 :We'll have a swashing and a martial outside--
 :As many other mannish cowards have
 :That do outface it with their semblances.
 :
 :CELIA
S:
 :What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND
 :
 :I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
 :And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
 :But what will you be called?
 :
 :CELIA
S:
 :Something that hath a reference to my state:
 :
S:No longer Celia, but Aliena.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND
 :
 :But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal
 :
 :The clownish fool out of your father's court?
 :
 :Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
S:
 :
S:CELIA
 :
 :He'll go along o'er the wide world with me.
 :
 :Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away
 :
S:And get our jewels and our wealth together,
 :
 :Devise the fittest time and safest way
 :
S:To hide us from pursuit that will be made
 :
 :After my flight. Now go we in content
 :
 :To liberty, and not to banishment.

 :=======
 :[Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and two or three Lords, like
 :foresters.]
 :
 :
S:
S:DUKE SENIOR
 :
 :Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
 :
 :Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
 :
 :Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
 :More free from peril than the envious court?
S:Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
 :
 :The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
 :
 :And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
 :
 :Which when it bites and blows upon my body
 :Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
S:"This is no flattery. These are counselors
 :
 :That feelingly persuade me what I am."
 :
 :Sweet are the uses of adversity,
 :
 :Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
 :Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
S:And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
 :
 :Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
 :
 :Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
 :
 :
 :AMIENS
 :I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,
S:That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
 :
 :Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :
S:Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
 :
 :And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
 :
 :Being native burghers of this desert city,
 :
 :Should in their own confines with forked heads
 :Have their round haunches gored.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Indeed, my lord,
 :The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
 :And in that kind swears you do more usurp
S:
 :Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
 :
S:Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
 :
 :Did steal behind him as he lay along
 :
 :Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
 :
 :Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
S:To the which place a poor sequestered stag
 :
 :That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
 :
 :Did come to languish. And indeed, my lord,
 :
 :The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
 :That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
 :Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
 :Coursed one another down his innocent nose
 :In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,
 :Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
S:
 :Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
 :
S:Augmenting it with tears.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE SENIOR  But what said Jaques?
 :
 :Did he not moralize this spectacle?
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST LORD
 :
S:O yes, into a thousand similes.
 :
 :First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
 :
 :"Poor deer," quoth he, "thou mak'st a testament
 :
 :As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
 :To that which had too much." Then, being there
 :alone,
 :Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
 :"'Tis right," quoth he. "Thus misery doth part
S:The flux of company." Anon a careless herd,
 :
 :Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
 :
 :And never stays to greet him. "Ay," quoth Jaques,
 :
 :"Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.
 :'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
 :Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?"
 :Thus most invectively he pierceth through
S:The body of country, city, court,
 :
 :Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
 :
 :Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
 :
 :To fright the animals and to kill them up
 :In their assigned and native dwelling place.
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
S:And did you leave him in this contemplation?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD
 :
 :We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
 :Upon the sobbing deer.
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  Show me the place.
 :I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
 :For then he's full of matter.
S:
 :
 :
S:FIRST LORD  I'll bring you to him straight.

S:

 :

 :Come not within these doors. Within this roof
 :The enemy of all your graces lives.
 :Your brother--no, no brother--yet the son--
 :Yet not the son, I will not call him son--
S:Of him I was about to call his father,
 :
 :Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
 :
 :To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
 :
 :And you within it. If he fail of that,
S:He will have other means to cut you off.

 :I overheard him and his practices.
 :
 :This is no place, this house is but a butchery.

S:ADAM
 :
 :No matter whither, so you come not here.
 :
 :

 :ORLANDO
S:What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
 :
 :Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
 :
 :A thievish living on the common road?
 :
 :This I must do, or know not what to do;
 :Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
 :I rather will subject me to the malice
 :Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
 :
 :ADAM
S:
S:But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
 :
 :The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
 :
 :Which I did store to be my foster nurse
 :
 :When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
 :And unregarded age in corners thrown.
S:Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
 :
 :Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
 :
 :Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.
 :
 :All this I give you. Let me be your servant.
S:Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
 :
 :For in my youth I never did apply
 :
 :Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
 :
 :Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
 :The means of weakness and debility.
 :Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,

 :When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
 :Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
S:
 :Where none will sweat but for promotion,
 :
S:And having that do choke their service up
 :
 :Even with the having. It is not so with thee.
 :
 :But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
 :
 :That cannot so much as a blossom yield
 :In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
 :But come thy ways. We'll go along together,
 :And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
 :We'll light upon some settled low content.

 :Master, go on, and I will follow thee
 :
 :To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.

 :From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
 :Here lived I, but now live here no more.

 :courage, good Aliena.
S:
 :
 :
S:CELIA  I pray you bear with me. I cannot go no further.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  For my part, I had rather bear with you
 :
 :than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did
 :bear you, for I think you have no money in your
 :purse.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.
 :When I was at home I was in a better place, but

S:

S:

 :
 :

 :
 :That is the way to make her scorn you still.
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
S:
 :
 :CORIN
 :
 :I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
 :Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
 :As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
 :But if thy love were ever like to mine--
S:
 :As sure I think did never man love so--
 :
 :How many actions most ridiculous
 :
 :Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
 :
 :
 :CORIN
S:Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
 :O, thou didst then never love so heartily.
 :If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
 :That ever love did make thee run into,
 :Thou hast not loved.
 :Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
S:Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
 :
 :Thou hast not loved.
 :
S:Or if thou hast not broke from company
 :
 :Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
 :
 :Thou hast not loved.
 :
 :O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!	[He exits.]
 :
 :ROSALIND
 :Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,
 :I have by hard adventure found mine own.
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  And I mine. I remember when I was in
 :
S:love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him
 :
 :take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I
 :
 :remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow's
 :
S:dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked;
 :
 :and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of
 :
 :her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her
 :
 :them again, said with weeping tears "Wear these for
 :my sake." We that are true lovers run into strange
S:capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature
 :
 :in love mortal in folly.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own
 :
 :wit till I break my shins against it.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND
 :Jove, Jove, this shepherd's passion
 :Is much upon my fashion.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  And mine, but it grows something stale
 :with me.
S:
 :
 :
 :CELIA  I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he
 :
 :for gold will give us any food. I faint almost to death.
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE, [to Corin]  Holla, you clown!
 :
 :ROSALIND  Peace, fool. He's not thy kinsman.
S:
 :
 :CORIN  Who calls?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Your betters, sir.
 :
 :CORIN  Else are they very wretched.
S:
 :
S:ROSALIND, [to Touchstone]
 :
 :Peace, I say. [As Ganymede, to Corin.]
 :
S:Good even toyou, friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORIN
 :
 :And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
 :Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
 :Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
S:
 :Here's a young maid with travel much oppressed,
 :
 :And faints for succor.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORIN  Fair sir, I pity her
 :And wish for her sake more than for mine own
 :My fortunes were more able to relieve her.
 :But I am shepherd to another man
 :And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
S:
 :My master is of churlish disposition
 :
 :And little recks to find the way to heaven
 :
S:By doing deeds of hospitality.
 :
 :Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed
 :
 :Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
 :
 :By reason of his absence, there is nothing
 :That you will feed on. But what is, come see,
S:And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
 :What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
 :
 :
 :
 :CORIN
S:That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
 :
 :That little cares for buying anything.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
 :Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
 :And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
S:
 :And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
 :
 :And willingly could waste my time in it.
 :
 :
 :
S:CORIN
 :
 :Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
 :
 :Go with me. If you like upon report
 :
 :The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
 :I will your very faithful feeder be
S:And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

S:JAQUES  More, more, I prithee, more.

S:

 :
 :More, I prithee, more.
 :
 :AMIENS  My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.
 :
 :JAQUES  I do not desire you to please me. I do desire
S:you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you
 :
 :'em "stanzos"?
 :
 :
 :
 :AMIENS  What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
 :
 :JAQUES  Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me
 :nothing. Will you sing?
S:
 :
 :AMIENS  More at your request than to please myself.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank
 :you. But that they call "compliment" is like th'
 :encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks
 :me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and
 :he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And
 :you that will not, hold your tongues.
S:
S:
 :
 :AMIENS  Well, I'll end the song.--Sirs, cover the while;
 :
 :the Duke will drink under this tree.--He hath been
 :
 :all this day to look you.
 :
 :JAQUES  And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
 :too disputable for my company. I think of as many

 :
 :AMIENS  What's that "ducdame"?
 :
S:JAQUES  'Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a

 :
 :[Enter Duke Senior and Lords, like outlaws.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
S:I think he be transformed into a beast,
 :
S:For I can nowhere find him like a man.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :
S:My lord, he is but even now gone hence.

S:He saves my labor by his own approach.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR, [to Jaques]
 :
 :Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this
 :That your poor friends must woo your company?
 :What, you look merrily.
 :
 :JAQUES
S:A fool, a fool, I met a fool i' th' forest,
 :
 :A motley fool. A miserable world!
 :
 :As I do live by food, I met a fool,
 :
 :Who laid him down and basked him in the sun
S:And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,
 :
 :In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
 :
 :"Good morrow, fool," quoth I. "No, sir," quoth he,
 :
 :"Call me not 'fool' till heaven hath sent me
 :fortune."
 :And then he drew a dial from his poke
 :And, looking on it with lack-luster eye,
 :Says very wisely "It is ten o'clock.
S:Thus we may see," quoth he, "how the world wags.
 :
 :'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
 :
 :And after one hour more 'twill be eleven.
 :
 :And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
 :And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,
 :And thereby hangs a tale." When I did hear
 :The motley fool thus moral on the time,
 :My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
 :That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
S:
 :And I did laugh sans intermission
 :
 :An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
 :
 :A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  What fool is this?
 :
 :
 :
S:JAQUES
 :
 :O worthy fool!--One that hath been a courtier,
 :
 :And says "If ladies be but young and fair,
 :
 :They have the gift to know it." And in his brain,
 :Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
 :After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed
 :With observation, the which he vents
 :In mangled forms. O, that I were a fool!
 :I am ambitious for a motley coat.
S:
S:
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :
 :Thou shalt have one.
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  It is my only suit,
 :Provided that you weed your better judgments
S:Of all opinion that grows rank in them
 :
 :That I am wise. I must have liberty
 :
 :Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
 :
 :To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.
 :And they that are most galled with my folly,
 :They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
S:The "why" is plain as way to parish church:
 :
 :He that a fool doth very wisely hit
 :
 :Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
 :
 :Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,
S:The wise man's folly is anatomized
 :
 :Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
 :
 :Invest me in my motley. Give me leave
 :
 :To speak my mind, and I will through and through
 :Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
 :If they will patiently receive my medicine.
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
S:
 :
 :
 :JAQUES
 :
 :What, for a counter, would I do but good?
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin;
 :For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
 :As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
S:
 :And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
 :
 :That thou with license of free foot hast caught
 :
 :Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  Why, who cries out on pride
 :
 :That can therein tax any private party?
 :
 :Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
 :Till that the weary very means do ebb?
 :What woman in the city do I name
 :When that I say the city-woman bears
 :The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
S:Who can come in and say that I mean her,
 :
 :When such a one as she such is her neighbor?
 :
 :Or what is he of basest function
 :
 :That says his bravery is not on my cost,
 :Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
 :His folly to the mettle of my speech?
 :There then. How then, what then? Let me see
S:wherein
 :
S:My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,
 :
 :Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,
 :
 :Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies
 :
 :Unclaimed of any man.
 :
 :[Enter Orlando, brandishing a sword.]
 :
 :But who comes here?
 :
S:
 :ORLANDO  Forbear, and eat no more.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Why, I have eat none yet.
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
S:Nor shalt not till necessity be served.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Of what kind should this cock come of?
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR, [to Orlando]
S:Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress,
 :
S:Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
 :
 :That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
S:You touched my vein at first. The thorny point
 :
 :Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
 :
S:Of smooth civility, yet am I inland bred
 :
 :And know some nurture. But forbear, I say.
 :
 :He dies that touches any of this fruit
 :
 :Till I and my affairs are answered.
 :
 :JAQUES  An you will not be answered with reason, I
 :must die.
 :
S:DUKE SENIOR, [to Orlando]
 :
 :What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
 :
 :More than your force move us to gentleness.
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :I almost die for food, and let me have it.
 :
S:DUKE SENIOR
 :
 :Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO
 :
 :Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.
 :
 :I thought that all things had been savage here,
 :
 :And therefore put I on the countenance
S:Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
 :
 :That in this desert inaccessible,
 :
 :Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
 :
 :Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,
S:If ever you have looked on better days,
 :
 :If ever been where bells have knolled to church,
 :
 :If ever sat at any good man's feast,
 :
 :If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
S:And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
 :
 :Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,
 :
 :In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.
 :
 :[He sheathes his sword.]
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
S:True is it that we have seen better days,
 :
 :And have with holy bell been knolled to church,
 :
 :And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
 :
 :Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
 :And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
 :And take upon command what help we have
 :That to your wanting may be ministered.
 :
 :ORLANDO
S:
 :Then but forbear your food a little while
 :
 :Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
 :
 :And give it food. There is an old poor man
 :
S:Who after me hath many a weary step
 :
 :Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,
 :
 :Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,
 :
 :I will not touch a bit.
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  Go find him out,
S:And we will nothing waste till you return.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :
 :I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
S:This wide and universal theater
 :
 :Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
 :
 :Wherein we play in.
 :
 :
S:JAQUES  All the world's a stage,
 :
 :And all the men and women merely players.
 :
 :They have their exits and their entrances,
 :
 :And one man in his time plays many parts,
S:His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
 :
 :Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
 :
S:Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
 :
 :And shining morning face, creeping like snail
 :
 :Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
 :
 :Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
 :Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
 :Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
 :Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
 :Seeking the bubble reputation
 :Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
S:
S:In fair round belly with good capon lined,
 :
 :With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
 :
 :Full of wise saws and modern instances;
 :
 :And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
S:Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
 :
S:With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
 :
 :His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
 :
 :For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
 :
 :Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
 :And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
 :That ends this strange eventful history,
 :Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
 :Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

 :TOUCHSTONE  Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a
 :good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it
 :is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very
 :well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile
 :life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me
S:
 :well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is
 :
 :tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my
 :
 :humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it
 :
S:goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy
 :
S:in thee, shepherd?
 :
 :
 :
 :CORIN  No more but that I know the more one sickens,
 :
 :the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants
 :money, means, and content is without three good
S:friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire
 :
 :to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that
 :
S:a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he
 :
 :that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
 :
 :complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull
 :
 :kindred.
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast
 :
 :ever in court, shepherd?
 :
 :
 :CORIN  No, truly.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Then thou art damned.
 :
S:CORIN  Nay, I hope.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted
 :
 :egg, all on one side.
 :
 :CORIN  For not being at court? Your reason.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Why, if thou never wast at court, thou
 :never saw'st good manners; if thou never saw'st
S:
 :good manners, then thy manners must be wicked,
 :
 :and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou
 :
 :art in a parlous state, shepherd.
 :
 :
 :CORIN  Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good
 :manners at the court are as ridiculous in the
S:country as the behavior of the country is most
 :
 :mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at
 :
 :the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy
 :
 :would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
 :
 :CORIN  Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
 :fells, you know, are greasy.
S:
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat?
 :
 :And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as
 :
 :the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better
S:instance, I say. Come.
 :
 :
 :
 :CORIN  Besides, our hands are hard.
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow
 :again. A more sounder instance. Come.
 :
 :CORIN  And they are often tarred over with the surgery
S:of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The
 :
 :courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Most shallow man. Thou worms' meat in
 :respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed. Learn of the
 :wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar,
 :the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance,
 :shepherd.
 :
S:
 :CORIN  You have too courtly a wit for me. I'll rest.
 :
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee,
 :
 :shallow man. God make incision in thee; thou art
 :
 :raw.
 :
 :CORIN  Sir, I am a true laborer. I earn that I eat, get that
 :
S:I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness,
 :
 :glad of other men's good, content with my harm,
 :
 :and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze
 :
 :and my lambs suck.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  That is another simple sin in you, to bring
 :the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get
 :your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to
 :a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth
S:
 :to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of
 :
 :all reasonable match. If thou be'st not damned for
 :
 :this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I
 :
 :cannot see else how thou shouldst 'scape.
 :
 :[Enter Rosalind, as Ganymede.]
 :
S:
 :
 :CORIN  Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new
 :
 :mistress's brother.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, reading a paper]
 :From the east to western Ind
 :No jewel is like Rosalind.
 :Her worth being mounted on the wind,
S:Through all the world bears Rosalind.
 :
 :All the pictures fairest lined
 :
 :Are but black to Rosalind.
 :
 :Let no face be kept in mind
 :But the fair of Rosalind.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  I'll rhyme you so eight years together,
 :dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.
 :It is the right butter-women's rank to market.
S:
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Out, fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  For a taste:
 :If a hart do lack a hind,
 :Let him seek out Rosalind.
S:If the cat will after kind,
 :
 :So be sure will Rosalind.
 :
 :Wintered garments must be lined;
 :
 :So must slender Rosalind.
 :They that reap must sheaf and bind;
 :Then to cart with Rosalind.
 :Sweetest nut hath sourest rind;
 :Such a nut is Rosalind.
 :He that sweetest rose will find
S:
S:Must find love's prick, and Rosalind.
 :
 :This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you
 :
 :infect yourself with them?
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Peace, you dull fool. I found
 :
 :them on a tree.
 :
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I'll graft it with you, and
 :then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be
 :the earliest fruit i' th' country, for you'll be rotten
S:ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of
 :
 :the medlar.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  You have said, but whether wisely or no,
S:let the forest judge.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Celia, as Aliena, with a writing.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Peace. Here comes my sister
 :reading. Stand aside.
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena, reads]
S:
 :Why should this a desert be?
 :
 :For it is unpeopled? No.
 :
 :Tongues I'll hang on every tree
 :
S:That shall civil sayings show.
 :
 :Some how brief the life of man
 :
 :Runs his erring pilgrimage,
 :
S:That the stretching of a span
 :
S:Buckles in his sum of age;
 :
 :Some of violated vows
 :
 :'Twixt the souls of friend and friend.
 :
 :But upon the fairest boughs,
 :Or at every sentence' end,
 :Will I "Rosalinda" write,
 :Teaching all that read to know
 :The quintessence of every sprite
 :Heaven would in little show.
S:
 :Therefore heaven nature charged
 :
 :That one body should be filled
 :
 :With all graces wide-enlarged.
 :
S:Nature presently distilled
 :
 :Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
 :
 :Cleopatra's majesty,
 :
 :Atalanta's better part,
S:Sad Lucretia's modesty.
 :
 :Thus Rosalind of many parts
 :
 :By heavenly synod was devised
 :
 :Of many faces, eyes, and hearts
 :To have the touches dearest prized.
 :Heaven would that she these gifts should have
 :And I to live and die her slave.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  O most gentle Jupiter, what
S:
 :tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners
 :
 :withal, and never cried "Have patience,
 :
 :good people!"
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  How now?--Back, friends. Shepherd,
 :go off a little.--Go with him, sirrah.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Come, shepherd, let us make an honorable
S:
 :retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet
 :
 :with scrip and scrippage.
 :
 :[Touchstone and Corin exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Didst thou hear these verses?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for
S:some of them had in them more feet than the verses
 :
 :would bear.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  That's no matter. The feet might bear the verses.
 :
 :ROSALIND  Ay, but the feet were lame and could not
 :bear themselves without the verse, and therefore
 :stood lamely in the verse.
 :
S:
 :CELIA  But didst thou hear without wondering how thy
 :
 :name should be hanged and carved upon these
 :
 :trees?
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  I was seven of the nine days out of the
 :
 :wonder before you came, for look here what I
 :
 :found on a palm tree. [She shows the paper she
 :read.] I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras'
 :time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly
S:remember.
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Trow you who hath done this?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Is it a man?
 :
S:CELIA  And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
 :
 :Change you color?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  I prithee, who?
 :
 :CELIA  O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to
S:meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
 :
 :and so encounter.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Nay, but who is it?
 :
 :CELIA  Is it possible?
 :
 :ROSALIND  Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary
 :vehemence, tell me who it is.
S:
S:
 :
S:CELIA  O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
 :
 :wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that
 :
 :out of all whooping!
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  Good my complexion, dost thou think
 :
 :though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a
 :
 :doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of
 :
 :delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee,
 :tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
 :thou couldst stammer, that thou might'st pour this
 :concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out
 :of a narrow-mouthed bottle--either too much at
 :once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of
S:
 :thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  So you may put a man in your belly.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Is he of God's making? What manner of
 :man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a
 :beard?
 :
 :CELIA  Nay, he hath but a little beard.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND  Why, God will send more, if the man will be
 :
 :thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if
 :
 :thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
 :
S:
 :
 :CELIA  It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
 :
 :heels and your heart both in an instant.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad
 :brow and true maid.
 :
 :CELIA  I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND  Orlando?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Orlando.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet
 :and hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What
 :said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What
 :makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains
S:
 :he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou
 :
S:see him again? Answer me in one word.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first.
 :
 :'Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size.
 :To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
 :answer in a catechism.
 :
S:ROSALIND  But doth he know that I am in this forest and
 :
S:in man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
 :
 :day he wrestled?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
S:propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my
 :
 :finding him, and relish it with good observance. I
 :
 :found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  It may well be called Jove's tree when it
 :
 :drops forth such fruit.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Give me audience, good madam.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  Proceed.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  There lay he, stretched along like a wounded
S:knight.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
 :
 :becomes the ground.
S:
 :
 :CELIA  Cry "holla" to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets
 :
 :unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  I would sing my song without a burden. Thou
 :
 :bring'st me out of tune.
 :
 :ROSALIND  Do you not know I am a woman? When I
 :think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.
 :
 :CELIA  You bring me out.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Orlando and Jaques.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Soft, comes he not here?
 :
 :ROSALIND  'Tis he. Slink by, and note him.
 :[Rosalind and Celia step aside.]
 :
S:
 :JAQUES, [to Orlando]  I thank you for your company,
 :
 :but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I
 :thank you too for your society.
 :
 :JAQUES  God be wi' you. Let's meet as little as we can.
 :
S:
 :ORLANDO  I do desire we may be better strangers.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  I pray you mar no more trees with writing love
 :
S:songs in their barks.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I pray you mar no more of my verses with
 :
 :reading them ill-favoredly.
 :
 :JAQUES  Rosalind is your love's name?
 :
 :ORLANDO  Yes, just.
 :
S:
 :JAQUES  I do not like her name.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  There was no thought of pleasing you when
 :
 :she was christened.
 :
 :JAQUES  What stature is she of?
S:
 :
S:ORLANDO  Just as high as my heart.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  You are full of pretty answers. Have you not
 :
 :been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and
 :
S:conned them out of rings?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Not so. But I answer you right painted cloth,
 :
 :from whence you have studied your questions.
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  You have a nimble wit. I think 'twas made of
 :
 :Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? And we
 :
 :two will rail against our mistress the world and all
 :our misery.
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  I will chide no breather in the world but
 :
 :myself, against whom I know most faults.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  The worst fault you have is to be in love.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  'Tis a fault I will not change for your best
 :virtue. I am weary of you.
 :
 :JAQUES  By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I
 :found you.
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and
 :
 :you shall see him.
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  There I shall see mine own figure.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
 :
 :JAQUES  I'll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good
S:
 :Signior Love.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good
 :
 :Monsieur Melancholy.	[Jaques exits.]
 :
S:ROSALIND, [aside to Celia]  I will speak to him like a
 :
 :saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave
 :
 :with him. [As Ganymede.] Do you hear, forester?
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Very well. What would you?
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I pray you, what is 't
 :
 :o'clock?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  You should ask me what time o' day. There's
 :no clock in the forest.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Then there is no true lover
 :
 :in the forest; else sighing every minute and
 :
 :groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of
 :
 :time as well as a clock.
 :
 :ORLANDO  And why not the swift foot of time? Had not
S:that been as proper?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  By no means, sir. Time
 :
 :travels in divers paces with divers persons. I'll tell
 :you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal,
 :who time gallops withal, and who he stands still
 :withal.
 :
S:ORLANDO  I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Marry, he trots hard with a
 :
 :young maid between the contract of her marriage
 :and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a
 :se'nnight, time's pace is so hard that it seems the
 :length of seven year.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Who ambles time withal?
S:
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  With a priest that lacks Latin
 :
 :and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one
 :
S:sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other
 :
 :lives merrily because he feels no pain--the one
 :
S:lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,
 :
 :the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious
 :
S:penury. These time ambles withal.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Who doth he gallop withal?
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  With a thief to the gallows,
 :
S:for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks
 :
 :himself too soon there.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Who stays it still withal?
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  With lawyers in the vacation,
 :for they sleep between term and term, and
S:then they perceive not how time moves.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Where dwell you, pretty youth?
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  With this shepherdess, my
 :
 :sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe
 :
 :upon a petticoat.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Are you native of this place?
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  As the cony that you see
 :
 :dwell where she is kindled.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Your accent is something finer than you
 :
S:could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I have been told so of many.
 :
 :But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught
 :me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man,
 :one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in
 :love. I have heard him read many lectures against it,
 :and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched
 :with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally
S:
 :taxed their whole sex withal.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Can you remember any of the principal evils
 :
 :that he laid to the charge of women?
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  There were none principal.
 :
 :They were all like one another as halfpence are,
 :
 :every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow
 :
 :fault came to match it.
 :
 :ORLANDO  I prithee recount some of them.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  No, I will not cast away my
S:physic but on those that are sick. There is a man
 :
 :haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with
 :
 :carving "Rosalind" on their barks, hangs odes upon
 :
 :hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth,
 :deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet
 :that fancy-monger, I would give him some good
S:counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
 :
 :upon him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell
 :me your remedy.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  There is none of my uncle's
 :
 :marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man
 :
 :in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are
 :
 :not prisoner.
S:
 :
S:ORLANDO  What were his marks?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  A lean cheek, which you
 :
S:have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have
 :
 :not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a
 :
 :beard neglected, which you have not--but I pardon
 :
 :you for that, for simply your having in beard is a
S:younger brother's revenue. Then your hose should
 :
 :be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve
 :
 :unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything
 :
S:about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But
 :
 :you are no such man. You are rather point-device in
 :
 :your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming
 :
S:the lover of any other.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe
 :
 :I love.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Me believe it? You may as
S:soon make her that you love believe it, which I
 :
 :warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does.
 :
 :That is one of the points in the which women still
 :
S:give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,
 :
 :are you he that hangs the verses on the trees
 :
 :wherein Rosalind is so admired?
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
 :Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  But are you so much in love
 :as your rhymes speak?
S:
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Neither rhyme nor reason can express how
 :
 :much.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Love is merely a madness,
 :and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a
S:whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are
 :
 :not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so
 :
S:ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I
 :
 :profess curing it by counsel.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Did you ever cure any so?
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Yes, one, and in this manner.
 :
 :He was to imagine me his love, his mistress,
 :
 :and I set him every day to woo me; at which time
 :
 :would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be
 :effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,
S:fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears,
 :
 :full of smiles; for every passion something, and for
 :
S:no passion truly anything, as boys and women are,
 :
 :for the most part, cattle of this color; would now
 :
 :like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then
 :
 :forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him,
S:that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love
 :
 :to a living humor of madness, which was to forswear
 :
 :the full stream of the world and to live in a
 :
 :nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and
 :this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as
 :clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not
 :be one spot of love in 't.
 :
 :ORLANDO  I would not be cured, youth.
S:
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I would cure you if you
 :
 :would but call me Rosalind and come every day to
 :
 :my cote and woo me.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me
 :where it is.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Go with me to it, and I'll
 :
 :show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where
 :
 :in the forest you live. Will you go?
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  With all my heart, good youth.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Nay, you must call me
 :
 :Rosalind.--Come, sister, will you go?
 :
 :[They exit.]

 :Scene 3
 :=======
 :[Enter Touchstone and Audrey, followed by Jaques.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up
 :
 :your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the
 :man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?
 :
S:AUDREY  Your features, Lord warrant us! What
 :
 :features?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  I am here with thee and thy goats, as the
 :most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the
 :Goths.
 :
 :JAQUES, [aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than
 :Jove in a thatched house.
S:
 :
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  When a man's verses cannot be understood,
 :
 :nor a man's good wit seconded with the
 :
 :forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more
 :
S:dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I
 :
 :would the gods had made thee poetical.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUDREY  I do not know what "poetical" is. Is it honest
 :in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most
 :feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what
 :they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do
S:
 :feign.
 :
 :
 :
S:AUDREY  Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me
 :
 :poetical?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou
 :art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have
 :some hope thou didst feign.
 :
 :AUDREY  Would you not have me honest?
 :
S:
 :TOUCHSTONE  No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored;
 :
 :for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a
 :
 :sauce to sugar.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES, [aside]  A material fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUDREY  Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the
 :gods make me honest.
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a
 :
 :foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean
 :
 :dish.
 :
 :
 :AUDREY  I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am
 :foul.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
 :sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
S:
 :be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been
 :
 :with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village,
 :
 :who hath promised to meet me in this place of the
 :
 :forest and to couple us.
 :
 :JAQUES, [aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
 :
S:AUDREY  Well, the gods give us joy.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful
 :
 :heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no
 :temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts.
 :But what though? Courage. As horns are odious,
 :they are necessary. It is said "Many a man knows no
 :end of his goods." Right: many a man has good
 :horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the
S:
 :dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his own getting.
 :
 :Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no. The
 :
 :noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the
 :
 :single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town
 :is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of
 :a married man more honorable than the bare brow
 :of a bachelor. And by how much defense is better
 :than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious
S:
 :than to want.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Sir Oliver Martext.]
 :
 :
 :Here comes Sir Oliver.--Sir Oliver Martext, you are
 :well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree,
 :or shall we go with you to your chapel?
 :
S:
 :OLIVER MARTEXT  Is there none here to give the
 :
S:woman?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  I will not take her on gift of any man.
 :
 :
S:OLIVER MARTEXT  Truly, she must be given, or the
 :
 :marriage is not lawful.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES, [coming forward]  Proceed, proceed. I'll give
S:her.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Good even, good Monsieur What-you-call-'t.
 :
 :How do you, sir? You are very well met. God
S:'ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see
 :
 :you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be
 :
 :covered.
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Will you be married, motley?
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his
 :curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his
 :desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be
S:
 :nibbling.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
 :
S:married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
 :
 :church, and have a good priest that can tell you
 :
 :what marriage is. This fellow will but join you
 :
 :together as they join wainscot. Then one of you will
 :prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp,
 :warp.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  I am not in the mind but I were better to
 :be married of him than of another, for he is not like
S:
 :to marry me well, and not being well married, it
 :
 :will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my
 :
 :wife.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
 :
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married,
 :
 :or we must live in bawdry.--Farewell, good
 :
 :Master Oliver, not
 :O sweet Oliver,
 :O brave Oliver,
S:Leave me not behind thee,
 :
 :But
 :
 :Wind away,
 :
 :Begone, I say,
 :I will not to wedding with thee.
 :[Audrey, Touchstone, and Jaques exit.]
 :
 :OLIVER MARTEXT  'Tis no matter. Ne'er a fantastical
 :knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.
S:
 :[He exits.]

 :
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,
 :
 :dressed as Aliena.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Never talk to me. I will weep.
 :
 :CELIA  Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
S:that tears do not become a man.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  But have I not cause to weep?
 :
 :
 :CELIA  As good cause as one would desire. Therefore
 :weep.
 :
 :ROSALIND  His very hair is of the dissembling color.
 :
S:
 :CELIA  Something browner than Judas's. Marry, his
 :
 :kisses are Judas's own children.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  I' faith, his hair is of a good color.
 :
 :CELIA  An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the
 :only color.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the
 :
 :touch of holy bread.
 :
 :
 :CELIA  He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A
 :nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously.
 :The very ice of chastity is in them.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  But why did he swear he would come this
 :
S:morning, and comes not?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Do you think so?
 :
 :CELIA  Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-steale
 :r,
 :but for his verity in love, I do think him as
S:
 :concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  Not true in love?
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
 :
 :ROSALIND  You have heard him swear downright he
 :was.
S:
 :
 :
 :CELIA  "Was" is not "is." Besides, the oath of a lover is
 :
 :no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are
 :
S:both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
 :
 :here in the forest on the Duke your father.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND  I met the Duke yesterday and had much
S:question with him. He asked me of what parentage
 :
 :I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed
 :
 :and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
 :
 :there is such a man as Orlando?
 :
 :CELIA  O, that's a brave man. He writes brave verses,
 :speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks
 :them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
 :his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on
S:
 :one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all's
 :
 :brave that youth mounts and folly guides.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Corin.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Who comes here?
 :
 :
 :CORIN
 :Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
 :After the shepherd that complained of love,
 :Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
 :Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
S:
 :That was his mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  Well, and what of him?
 :
S:
 :
 :CORIN
 :
 :If you will see a pageant truly played
 :
 :Between the pale complexion of true love
 :And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
 :Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you
 :If you will mark it.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [aside to Celia]  O come, let us remove.
 :
 :The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
 :
 :[As Ganymede, to Corin.]
 :
 :Bring us to this sight, andyou shall say
 :I'll prove a busy actor in their play.

 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SILVIUS
 :
 :Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me. Do not, Phoebe.
 :
 :Say that you love me not, but say not so
 :
S:In bitterness. The common executioner,
 :
 :Whose heart th' accustomed sight of death makes
 :

 :
 :Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
 :But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
S:Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

 :

S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE
 :
 :I would not be thy executioner.
 :I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
 :Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
 :'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable
 :That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
 :Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
S:
S:Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.
 :
S:Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,
 :
 :And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
 :
 :Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
 :
 :Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
 :Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
 :Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
 :Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
 :Some scar of it. Lean upon a rush,
 :The cicatrice and capable impressure
S:
 :Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,
 :
 :Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
 :
 :Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
 :
 :That can do hurt.
 :
 :SILVIUS  O dear Phoebe,
 :If ever--as that ever may be near--
S:You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
 :
 :Then shall you know the wounds invisible
 :
 :That love's keen arrows make.
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE  But till that time
S:Come not thou near me. And when that time
 :
S:comes,
 :
 :Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,
 :
 :As till that time I shall not pity thee.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, coming forward]
 :And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
 :That you insult, exult, and all at once,
 :Over the wretched? What though you have no
 :beauty--
S:
 :As, by my faith, I see no more in you
 :
 :Than without candle may go dark to bed--
 :
 :Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
 :
 :Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
 :I see no more in you than in the ordinary
 :Of nature's sale-work.--'Od's my little life,
 :I think she means to tangle my eyes, too.--
 :No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.
S:
 :'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
 :
 :Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream
 :
S:That can entame my spirits to your worship.--
 :
S:You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
 :
 :Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
 :
 :You are a thousand times a properer man
 :
 :Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
S:That makes the world full of ill-favored children.
 :
 :'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,
 :
 :And out of you she sees herself more proper
 :
 :Than any of her lineaments can show her.--
 :But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees
S:And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love,
 :
 :For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
 :
 :Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
 :
 :Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
 :Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.--
 :So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
 :
 :PHOEBE
 :Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
S:
 :I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND[,as Ganymede]  He's fall'n in love with your
 :
 :foulness. [(To Silvius.)] And she'll fall in love with
 :my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with
 :frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. [(To
 :Phoebe.)] Why look you so upon me?
 :
S:
 :PHOEBE  For no ill will I bear you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
S:I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
 :
 :For I am falser than vows made in wine.
 :
 :Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
 :
 :'Tis at the tuft of olives, here hard by.--
 :Will you go, sister?--Shepherd, ply her hard.--
 :Come, sister.--Shepherdess, look on him better,
 :And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
 :None could be so abused in sight as he.--
 :Come, to our flock.
S:
 :[She exits, with Celia and Corin.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE, [aside]
 :
 :Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
 :"Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?"
 :
S:SILVIUS
 :
 :Sweet Phoebe--
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE  Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?
S:
 :
S:SILVIUS  Sweet Phoebe, pity me.
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE
 :
S:Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
 :Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
S:If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
 :
 :By giving love your sorrow and my grief
 :
 :Were both extermined.
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE
 :Thou hast my love. Is not that neighborly?
 :
 :SILVIUS
S:I would have you.
 :
S:
 :
 :PHOEBE  Why, that were covetousness.
 :
 :Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
 :
 :And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
 :But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
 :Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
 :I will endure, and I'll employ thee too.
 :But do not look for further recompense
 :Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
S:
S:
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
S:So holy and so perfect is my love,
 :
 :And I in such a poverty of grace,
 :
 :That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
 :
 :To glean the broken ears after the man
 :That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then
 :A scattered smile, and that I'll live upon.
 :
 :PHOEBE
S:Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
 :Not very well, but I have met him oft,
 :And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
S:That the old carlot once was master of.
 :
 :
 :
S:PHOEBE
 :
 :Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
 :
 :'Tis but a peevish boy--yet he talks well--
 :
 :But what care I for words? Yet words do well
 :When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
 :It is a pretty youth--not very pretty--
 :But sure he's proud--and yet his pride becomes
 :him.
 :He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
S:
S:Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
 :
 :Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.
 :
 :He is not very tall--yet for his years he's tall.
 :
 :His leg is but so-so--and yet 'tis well.
S:There was a pretty redness in his lip,
 :
S:A little riper and more lusty red
 :
 :Than that mixed in his cheek: 'twas just the
 :
 :difference
 :
 :Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
 :There be some women, Silvius, had they marked
 :him
 :In parcels as I did, would have gone near
 :To fall in love with him; but for my part
 :I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
S:
 :I have more cause to hate him than to love him.
 :
 :For what had he to do to chide at me?
 :
S:He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,
 :
 :And now I am remembered, scorned at me.
 :
 :I marvel why I answered not again.
 :
S:But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
 :
 :I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
 :
 :And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :Phoebe, with all my heart.
 :
 :PHOEBE  I'll write it straight.
 :The matter's in my head and in my heart.
S:
S:I will be bitter with him and passing short.

S:
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better
 :
 :acquainted with thee.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  They say you are a melancholy
 :
 :fellow.
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  I am so. I do love it better than laughing.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Those that are in extremity
 :of either are abominable fellows and betray
S:themselves to every modern censure worse than
 :
 :drunkards.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Why then, 'tis good to be a
 :post.
 :
 :JAQUES  I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which
S:
 :is emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical;
 :
 :nor the courtier's, which is proud; nor the
 :
 :soldier's, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer's,
 :
S:which is politic; nor the lady's, which is nice; nor
 :
 :the lover's, which is all these; but it is a melancholy
 :
 :of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
 :
 :from many objects, and indeed the sundry
 :contemplation of my travels, in which my often
S:rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  A traveller. By my faith, you
 :
 :have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold
 :your own lands to see other men's. Then to have
 :seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes
 :and poor hands.
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  Yes, I have gained my experience.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And your experience makes
 :you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry
 :than experience to make me sad--and to travel for
 :it too.
 :
 :[Enter Orlando.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :
S:Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Nay then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank
 :
 :verse.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Farewell, Monsieur Traveller.
 :Look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all
 :the benefits of your own country, be out of love with
 :your nativity, and almost chide God for making you
S:
 :that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you
 :
 :have swam in a gondola.
 :
 :[Jaques exits.]
 :
 :Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all
 :this while? You a lover? An you serve me such
 :another trick, never come in my sight more.
 :
 :ORLANDO  My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of
S:
 :my promise.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Break an hour's promise in
 :
 :love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand
S:parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a
 :
 :minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him
 :
 :that Cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
 :
S:warrant him heart-whole.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO  Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Nay, an you be so tardy,
 :
 :come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of
S:a snail.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO  Of a snail?
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Ay, of a snail, for though he
 :
 :comes slowly, he carries his house on his head--a
 :
S:better jointure, I think, than you make a woman.
 :
 :Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO  What's that?
 :
S:
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Why, horns, which such as
 :
 :you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But
 :
 :he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the
 :
 :slander of his wife.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is
 :virtuous.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And I am your Rosalind.
S:
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  It pleases him to call you so, but he
 :
 :hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, to Orlando]  Come, woo me,
 :
 :woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like
 :
 :enough to consent. What would you say to me now
 :
S:an I were your very, very Rosalind?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I would kiss before I spoke.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Nay, you were better speak
 :first, and when you were gravelled for lack of
 :matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good
S:orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
 :
 :lovers lacking--God warn us--matter, the cleanliest
 :
S:shift is to kiss.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  How if the kiss be denied?
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Then she puts you to entreaty,
S:and there begins new matter.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Who could be out, being before his beloved
 :
 :mistress?
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Marry, that should you if I
 :
 :were your mistress, or I should think my honesty
 :
 :ranker than my wit.
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  What, of my suit?
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Not out of your apparel, and
 :yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  I take some joy to say you are because I
 :
 :would be talking of her.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Well, in her person I say I
 :will not have you.
 :
 :ORLANDO  Then, in mine own person I die.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  No, faith, die by attorney.
 :
 :The poor world is almost six thousand years old,
 :
 :and in all this time there was not any man died in
 :
S:his own person, videlicet, in a love cause. Troilus
 :
 :had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet
 :
 :he did what he could to die before, and he is one of
 :
 :the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived
 :many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it
 :had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good
 :youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont
 :and, being taken with the cramp, was
 :drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age
S:
 :found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies.
 :
 :Men have died from time to time and worms have
 :
 :eaten them, but not for love.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  I would not have my right Rosalind of this
 :
 :mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  By this hand, it will not kill a
 :
 :fly. But come; now I will be your Rosalind in a more
 :
 :coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I
 :will grant it.
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Then love me, Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and
S:Saturdays and all.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  And wilt thou have me?
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Ay, and twenty such.
 :
 :ORLANDO  What sayest thou?
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Are you not good?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  I hope so.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Why then, can one desire
 :
 :too much of a good thing?--Come, sister, you shall
 :
 :be the priest and marry us.--Give me your hand,
 :
 :Orlando.--What do you say, sister?
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO, [to Celia]  Pray thee marry us.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  I cannot say the words.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  You must begin "Will you,
 :
 :Orlando--"
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  Go to.--Will you, Orlando, have to
 :wife this Rosalind?
 :
 :ORLANDO  I will.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Ay, but when?
S:
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Why now, as fast as she can marry us.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Then you must say "I take
 :thee, Rosalind, for wife."
S:
 :
S:ORLANDO  I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I might ask you for your
 :
 :commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my
 :husband. There's a girl goes before the priest, and
 :certainly a woman's thought runs before her
 :actions.
 :
 :ORLANDO  So do all thoughts. They are winged.
S:
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Now tell me how long you
 :
 :would have her after you have possessed her?
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Forever and a day.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Say "a day" without the
 :"ever." No, no, Orlando, men are April when they
 :woo, December when they wed. Maids are May
 :when they are maids, but the sky changes when
 :they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a
S:Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous
 :
 :than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than
 :
 :an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I
 :
 :will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain,
S:and I will do that when you are disposed to be
 :
 :merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou
 :
 :art inclined to sleep.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  But will my Rosalind do so?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  By my life, she will do as I
 :do.
 :
 :ORLANDO  O, but she is wise.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Or else she could not have
 :
S:the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make
 :
 :the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out at the
 :
 :casement. Shut that, and 'twill out at the keyhole.
 :
 :Stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the
 :chimney.
 :
 :ORLANDO  A man that had a wife with such a wit, he
 :might say "Wit, whither wilt?"
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Nay, you might keep that
 :
 :check for it till you met your wife's wit going to
 :
 :your neighbor's bed.
 :
 :ORLANDO  And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Marry, to say she came to
S:seek you there. You shall never take her without her
 :
S:answer unless you take her without her tongue. O,
 :
 :that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
 :
 :occasion, let her never nurse her child
 :
 :herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
 :
 :ORLANDO  For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave
 :thee.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Alas, dear love, I cannot lack
S:
 :thee two hours.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO  I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two
 :
 :o'clock I will be with thee again.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Ay, go your ways, go your
 :ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told
 :me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering
 :tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
 :so, come, death. Two o'clock is your hour?
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Ay, sweet Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  By my troth, and in good
 :earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty
 :oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of
S:your promise or come one minute behind your
 :
 :hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,
 :
 :and the most hollow lover, and the most
 :
 :unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be
 :chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.
 :Therefore beware my censure, and keep your
S:promise.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLANDO  With no less religion than if thou wert indeed
 :
 :my Rosalind. So, adieu.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Well, time is the old justice
 :that examines all such offenders, and let time try.
 :Adieu.
 :[Orlando exits.]
 :
 :CELIA  You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.
S:
 :We must have your doublet and hose plucked
 :
S:over your head and show the world what the bird
 :
 :hath done to her own nest.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND  O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
 :
S:didst know how many fathom deep I am in love. But
 :
 :it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an
 :
S:unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA  Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour
 :
 :affection in, it runs out.
 :
 :ROSALIND  No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that
S:was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born
 :
 :of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses
 :
S:everyone's eyes because his own are out, let him be
 :
 :judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I
 :
 :cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
 :
 :shadow and sigh till he come.
 :
 :CELIA  And I'll sleep.

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Rosalind dressed as Ganymede and Celia
 :dressed as Aliena.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
 :
 :And here much Orlando.
 :
 :
 :CELIA  I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain
S:he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth
 :
 :to sleep.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Silvius.]
 :
 :Look who comes here.
 :
S:SILVIUS, [to Rosalind]
 :
 :My errand is to you, fair youth.
 :
 :My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.
 :
 :[He gives Rosalind a paper.]
 :I know not the contents, but as I guess
 :By the stern brow and waspish action
S:Which she did use as she was writing of it,
 :
S:It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me.
 :
 :I am but as a guiltless messenger.
 :
 :[Rosalind reads the letter.]
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
S:Patience herself would startle at this letter
 :
 :And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
 :
S:She says I am not fair, that I lack manners.
 :
 :She calls me proud, and that she could not love me
 :
 :Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will,
 :
 :Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.
 :Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
 :This is a letter of your own device.
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :No, I protest. I know not the contents.
S:
 :Phoebe did write it.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Come, come, you are a
 :
S:fool,
 :
 :And turned into the extremity of love.
 :
 :I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,
 :
 :A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think
 :That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands.
 :She has a huswife's hand--but that's no matter.
 :I say she never did invent this letter.
S:This is a man's invention, and his hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS  Sure it is hers.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
 :A style for challengers. Why, she defies me
 :Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
 :Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
S:
 :Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
 :
 :Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
 :
S:
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
 :So please you, for I never heard it yet,
 :
 :Yet heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty.
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.
 :[Read.]
 :Art thou god to shepherd turned,
S:
 :That a maiden's heart hath burned?
 :
 :Can a woman rail thus?
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS  Call you this railing?
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :[Read.]
S:Why, thy godhead laid apart,
 :
 :Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
 :
 :Did you ever hear such railing?
 :
 :Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
 :That could do no vengeance to me.
 :Meaning me a beast.
S:If the scorn of your bright eyne
 :
 :Have power to raise such love in mine,
 :
 :Alack, in me what strange effect
 :
 :Would they work in mild aspect?
S:Whiles you chid me, I did love.
 :
 :How then might your prayers move?
 :
S:He that brings this love to thee
 :
 :Little knows this love in me,
 :
 :And by him seal up thy mind
 :
 :Whether that thy youth and kind
 :Will the faithful offer take
 :Of me, and all that I can make,
 :Or else by him my love deny,
 :And then I'll study how to die.
 :
S:
 :SILVIUS  Call you this chiding?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  Alas, poor shepherd.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Do you pity him? No, he
 :
 :deserves no pity.--Wilt thou love such a woman?
 :
 :What, to make thee an instrument and play false
S:strains upon thee? Not to be endured. Well, go your
 :
 :way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame
 :
 :snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I
 :
 :charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never
 :have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true
 :lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more
S:company.	[Silvius exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Oliver.]
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER
 :Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,
 :Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
 :A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?
S:
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
 :
S:West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom;
 :
S:The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
 :
 :Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
 :
 :But at this hour the house doth keep itself.
 :
 :There's none within.
 :
 :OLIVER
 :If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
 :Then should I know you by description--
 :Such garments, and such years. "The boy is fair,
S:
 :Of female favor, and bestows himself
 :
 :Like a ripe sister; the woman low
 :
 :And browner than her brother." Are not you
 :
 :The owner of the house I did inquire for?
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
 :It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
 :
S:
 :OLIVER
 :
 :Orlando doth commend him to you both,
 :
 :And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
 :
S:He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
 :
 :[He shows a stained handkerchief.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :I am. What must we understand by this?
 :
 :OLIVER
S:Some of my shame, if you will know of me
 :
 :What man I am, and how, and why, and where
 :
 :This handkercher was stained.
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  I pray you tell it.
S:
 :
 :OLIVER
 :
S:When last the young Orlando parted from you,
 :
S:He left a promise to return again
 :
 :Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
 :
 :Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
 :
 :Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside--
 :And mark what object did present itself:
 :Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with
 :age
 :And high top bald with dry antiquity,
 :A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
S:
S:Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
 :
 :A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
 :
 :Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached
 :
 :The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,
S:Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself
 :
 :And, with indented glides, did slip away
 :
S:Into a bush, under which bush's shade
 :
 :A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
 :
 :Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch
 :
 :When that the sleeping man should stir--for 'tis
 :The royal disposition of that beast
 :To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
S:This seen, Orlando did approach the man
 :
 :And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
S:O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
 :
 :And he did render him the most unnatural
 :
S:That lived amongst men.
 :
 :
 :
S:OLIVER  And well he might so do,
 :
 :For well I know he was unnatural.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :But to Orlando: did he leave him there,
 :Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
 :
 :OLIVER
 :Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,
S:
 :But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
 :
 :And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
 :
 :Made him give battle to the lioness,
 :
S:Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling,
 :
 :From miserable slumber I awaked.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  Are you his brother?
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Was 't you he rescued?
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
 :
 :Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
 :
 :OLIVER
 :'Twas I, but 'tis not I. I do not shame
 :To tell you what I was, since my conversion
S:So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
S:But for the bloody napkin?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  By and by.
 :
 :When from the first to last betwixt us two
 :Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed--
 :As how I came into that desert place--
 :In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
 :Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
 :Committing me unto my brother's love;
S:
 :Who led me instantly unto his cave,
 :
 :There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
 :
 :The lioness had torn some flesh away,
 :
 :Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
 :And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
 :Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,
 :And after some small space, being strong at heart,
 :He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
S:
 :To tell this story, that you might excuse
 :
 :His broken promise, and to give this napkin
 :
 :Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
 :
 :That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
 :[Rosalind faints.]
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
S:Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER
 :
 :Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]
 :There is more in it.--Cousin Ganymede.
 :
S:OLIVER  Look, he recovers.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  I would I were at home.
 :
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  We'll lead you thither.--I pray you,
 :will you take him by the arm?
 :
 :OLIVER, [helping Rosalind to rise]  Be of good cheer,
S:youth. You a man? You lack a man's heart.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I do so, I confess it. Ah,
 :
 :sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.
 :I pray you tell your brother how well I
 :counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
 :
 :OLIVER  This was not counterfeit. There is too great
S:testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
 :
 :of earnest.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Counterfeit, I assure you.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER  Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
 :
S:be a man.
 :
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  So I do; but, i' faith, I should
 :
 :have been a woman by right.
 :
 :
 :CELIA, [as Aliena]  Come, you look paler and paler. Pray
S:you draw homewards.--Good sir, go with us.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVER
 :
 :That will I, for I must bear answer back
S:How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I shall devise something.
 :
 :But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
S:Will you go?

S:

 :
 :good. And yet it is not: it is but so-so. Art thou wise?

 :WILLIAM  Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember

S:wise man knows himself to be a fool." The heathen
 :
 :philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
 :
 :would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,

 :lips to open. You do love this maid?

 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
S:
 :
 :
 :WILLIAM  No, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Then learn this of me: to have is to have.
 :For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured
 :out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth
 :empty the other. For all your writers do consent
 :that ipse is "he." Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
S:

 :Therefore, you clown, abandon--which is in the
 :vulgar "leave"--the society--which in the boorish
 :is "company"--of this female--which in the common
 :is "woman"; which together is, abandon the
S:
 :society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or,
 :
 :to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill
 :
 :thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death,
 :
 :thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with
 :thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with
 :thee in faction. I will o'errun thee with policy. I

 :Nay, 'tis true. There was never anything so sudden
 :
 :but the fight of two rams, and Caesar's thrasonical
 :brag of "I came, saw, and overcame." For your
 :brother and my sister no sooner met but they
 :looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner
 :loved but they sighed, no sooner sighed but they
 :asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the
S:
 :reason but they sought the remedy; and in these
 :
 :degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage,
 :
 :which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent
 :
S:before marriage. They are in the very wrath
 :
 :of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part
 :
 :them.
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  They shall be married tomorrow, and I will
 :bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a
 :thing it is to look into happiness through another
 :man's eyes. By so much the more shall I tomorrow
 :be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I
S:
 :shall think my brother happy in having what he
 :
 :wishes for.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Why, then, tomorrow I cannot
 :serve your turn for Rosalind?
 :
 :ORLANDO  I can live no longer by thinking.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  I will weary you then no
 :
S:longer with idle talking. Know of me then--for
 :
 :now I speak to some purpose--that I know you are
 :
S:a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that
 :
 :you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,
 :
 :insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labor
 :
 :for a greater esteem than may in some little measure
S:draw a belief from you to do yourself good, and
 :
 :not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I
 :
 :can do strange things. I have, since I was three year
 :
 :old, conversed with a magician, most profound in
 :his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind
 :so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,
 :when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry
 :her. I know into what straits of fortune she is
 :driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear
S:
 :not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes
 :
 :tomorrow, human as she is, and without any
 :
 :danger.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  By my life I do, which I
 :tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore
 :put you in your best array, bid your friends; for
S:if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to
 :
S:Rosalind, if you will.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Silvius and Phoebe.]
 :
 :
 :Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of
 :hers.
 :
 :PHOEBE, [to Rosalind]
 :Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
S:
 :To show the letter that I writ to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
 :I care not if I have. It is my study
 :To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
 :You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
 :Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
 :
S:
 :PHOEBE, [to Silvius]
 :
 :Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :It is to be all made of sighs and tears,
 :And so am I for Phoebe.
 :
 :PHOEBE  And I for Ganymede.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  And I for Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And I for no woman.
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :It is to be all made of faith and service,
 :And so am I for Phoebe.
S:
S:
 :
 :PHOEBE  And I for Ganymede.
 :
S:
 :
 :ORLANDO  And I for Rosalind.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And I for no woman.
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :It is to be all made of fantasy,
 :All made of passion and all made of wishes,
 :All adoration, duty, and observance,
S:
 :All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
 :
 :All purity, all trial, all observance,
 :
 :And so am I for Phoebe.
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE  And so am I for Ganymede.
 :
 :ORLANDO  And so am I for Rosalind.
 :
S:
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  And so am I for no
 :
 :woman.
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE
S:If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
 :
 :If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Why do you speak too,
S:
S:"Why blame you me to love you?"
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]  Pray you, no more of this.
 :'Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the
 :moon. [(To Silvius.)] I will help you if I can. [(To
 :Phoebe.)] I would love you if I could.--Tomorrow
 :meet me all together. [(To Phoebe.)] I will marry
S:
 :you if ever I marry woman, and I'll be married
 :
 :tomorrow. [(To Orlando.)] I will satisfy you if ever I
 :
 :satisfy man, and you shall be married tomorrow.
 :
S:[(To Silvius.)] I will content you, if what pleases you
 :
 :contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.
 :
 :[(To Orlando.)] As you love Rosalind, meet. [(To
 :
S:Silvius.)] As you love Phoebe, meet.--And as I love
 :
 :no woman, I'll meet. So fare you well. I have left
 :
 :you commands.
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS  I'll not fail, if I live.
S:
 :
 :PHOEBE  Nor I.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO  Nor I.

S:
 :
 :
 :AUDREY  I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is

S:
 :
 :
S:FIRST PAGE  Well met, honest gentleman.

 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and
 :
 :a song.
 :
 :SECOND PAGE  We are for you. Sit i' th' middle.

 :FIRST PAGE  Shall we clap into 't roundly, without
S:
 :hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which
 :
 :are the only prologues to a bad voice?

 :

S:

S:PAGES [sing]
 :
 :It was a lover and his lass,

S:That o'er the green cornfield did pass

S:
S:When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.

 :
 :

 :Scene 4
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver,
 :
 :and Celia as Aliena.]
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
S:
 :Can do all this that he hath promised?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :
S:I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,
 :
 :As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, Silvius, and Phoebe.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
 :Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.
S:[To Duke.] You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
 :
 :You will bestow her on Orlando here?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, to Orlando]
 :
 :And you say you will have her when I bring her?
 :
 :
 :ORLANDO
S:That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
 :
 :
 :
 :ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, to Phoebe]
 :
 :You say you'll marry me if I be willing?
 :
 :PHOEBE
 :That will I, should I die the hour after.
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
 :But if you do refuse to marry me,
 :
S:You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
 :
 :
 :
 :PHOEBE  So is the bargain.
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede, to Silvius]
 :
 :You say that you'll have Phoebe if she will?
 :
 :
 :
 :SILVIUS
S:Though to have her and death were both one thing.
 :
 :
 :
S:ROSALIND, [as Ganymede]
 :
 :I have promised to make all this matter even.
 :
S:Keep you your word, O duke, to give your
 :
 :daughter,--
 :
 :You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.--
 :
 :Keep you your word, Phoebe, that you'll marry me,
 :Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.--
 :Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
 :If she refuse me. And from hence I go
 :To make these doubts all even.
S:[Rosalind and Celia exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR
 :
 :I do remember in this shepherd boy
 :Some lively touches of my daughter's favor.
 :
 :ORLANDO
 :My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
 :Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
S:
 :But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born
 :
 :And hath been tutored in the rudiments
 :
 :Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
 :
 :Whom he reports to be a great magician
 :Obscured in the circle of this forest.
 :
 :[Enter Touchstone and Audrey.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  There is sure another flood toward, and these
 :
 :couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
 :
S:very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called
 :
 :fools.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Salutation and greeting to you all.
 :
 :JAQUES, [to Duke]  Good my lord, bid him welcome.
 :This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so
 :often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he
 :swears.
S:
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  If any man doubt that, let him put me to
 :
 :my purgation. I have trod a measure. I have flattered
 :
 :a lady. I have been politic with my friend,
 :smooth with mine enemy. I have undone three
 :tailors. I have had four quarrels, and like to have
 :fought one.
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  And how was that ta'en up?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  Faith, we met and found the quarrel was
S:upon the seventh cause.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  How "seventh cause"?--Good my lord, like
 :
 :this fellow.
 :
S:DUKE SENIOR  I like him very well.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  God 'ild you, sir. I desire you of the like. I
 :
 :press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
 :copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as
S:marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir,
 :
 :an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own. A poor
 :
S:humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
 :
 :will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor
 :
 :house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  By my faith, he is very swift and
 :sententious.
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such
 :dulcet diseases.
S:
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  But for the seventh cause. How did you find the
 :
 :quarrel on the seventh cause?
 :
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  Upon a lie seven times removed.--Bear
 :
 :your body more seeming, Audrey.--As thus, sir: I
 :
 :did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard. He
 :
 :sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he
 :was in the mind it was. This is called "the retort
 :courteous." If I sent him word again it was not well
 :cut, he would send me word he cut it to please
 :himself. This is called "the quip modest." If again it
 :was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is
S:
 :called "the reply churlish." If again it was not well
 :
 :cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called
 :
 :"the reproof valiant." If again it was not well cut, he
 :
 :would say I lie. This is called "the countercheck
S:quarrelsome," and so to "the lie circumstantial,"
 :
 :and "the lie direct."
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES  And how oft did you say his beard was not well
 :
 :cut?
 :
 :
S:TOUCHSTONE  I durst go no further than the lie circumstantia
 :l,
 :
S:nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and
 :
 :so we measured swords and parted.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAQUES  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of
 :the lie?
S:
 :
 :TOUCHSTONE  O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as
 :
S:you have books for good manners. I will name you
 :
 :the degrees: the first, "the retort courteous"; the
 :
 :second, "the quip modest"; the third, "the reply
 :
 :churlish"; the fourth, "the reproof valiant"; the
 :fifth, "the countercheck quarrelsome"; the sixth,
 :"the lie with circumstance"; the seventh, "the lie
 :direct." All these you may avoid but the lie direct,
 :and you may avoid that too with an "if." I knew
 :when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but
S:
 :when the parties were met themselves, one of them
 :
 :thought but of an "if," as: "If you said so, then I said
 :
 :so." And they shook hands and swore brothers.
 :
 :Your "if" is the only peacemaker: much virtue in
 :"if."
 :
 :JAQUES, [to Duke]  Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
S:He's as good at anything and yet a fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  He uses his folly like a stalking-horse,
 :
 :and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
 :
 :[Enter Hymen, Rosalind, and Celia. Still music.]
 :
S:
 :
S:HYMEN
 :
 :Then is there mirth in heaven
 :
 :When earthly things made even
 :
 :Atone together.
 :Good duke, receive thy daughter.
 :Hymen from heaven brought her,
 :Yea, brought her hither,
 :That thou mightst join her hand with his,
S:Whose heart within his bosom is.

S:
 :
S:SECOND BROTHER
 :
 :Let me have audience for a word or two.
 :
 :I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
 :
 :That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
 :Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
 :Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
 :Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot
 :In his own conduct, purposely to take
 :His brother here and put him to the sword;
S:
S:And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
 :
 :Where, meeting with an old religious man,
 :
 :After some question with him, was converted
 :
 :Both from his enterprise and from the world,
 :His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,
S:And all their lands restored to them again
 :
S:That were with him exiled. This to be true
 :
 :I do engage my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  Welcome, young man.
S:Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
 :
 :To one his lands withheld, and to the other
 :
S:A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.--
 :
 :First, in this forest let us do those ends
 :
 :That here were well begun and well begot,
 :
 :And, after, every of this happy number
 :That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
 :Shall share the good of our returned fortune
S:According to the measure of their states.
 :
 :Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
 :
 :And fall into our rustic revelry.--
 :
 :Play, music.--And you brides and bridegrooms all,
 :With measure heaped in joy to th' measures fall.
 :
 :JAQUES, [to Second Brother]
 :Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,
 :The Duke hath put on a religious life
S:
 :And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND BROTHER  He hath.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAQUES
 :
S:To him will I. Out of these convertites
 :
 :There is much matter to be heard and learned.
 :
 :[To Duke.] You to your former honor I bequeath;
 :
 :Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
S:[To Orlando.] You to a love that your true faith doth
 :
 :merit.
 :
 :[To Oliver.] You to your land, and love, and great
 :
 :allies.
S:[To Silvius.] You to a long and well-deserved bed.
 :
 :[To Touchstone.] And you to wrangling, for thy
 :
 :loving voyage
 :
 :Is but for two months victualled.--So to your
S:pleasures.
 :
 :I am for other than for dancing measures.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE SENIOR  Stay, Jaques, stay.
 :
 :JAQUES
 :To see no pastime, I. What you would have
 :I'll stay to know at your abandoned cave.	[He exits.]
 :
S:

 :
 :Proceed, proceed. We'll begin these rites,
 :
 :As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

S:[Dance. All but Rosalind exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :EPILOGUE.
 :
 :=========
S:
 :
 :ROSALIND  It is not the fashion to see the lady the
 :
S:epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see
 :
 :the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine
 :
S:needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
 :
 :epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
 :
 :and good plays prove the better by the help of good
 :
 :epilogues. What a case am I in then that am neither
S:a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in
 :
 :the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a
 :
 :beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
 :
 :way is to conjure you, and I'll begin with the
S:women. I charge you, O women, for the love you
 :
 :bear to men, to like as much of this play as please
 :
 :you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear
 :
S:to women--as I perceive by your simpering, none
 :
S:of you hates them--that between you and the
 :
 :women the play may please. If I were a woman, I
 :
 :would kiss as many of you as had beards that
 :
 :pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths
S:that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have
 :
 :good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for
 :
 :my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
 :
 :[She exits.]
