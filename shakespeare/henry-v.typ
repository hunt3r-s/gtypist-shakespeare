 :O, for a muse of fire that would ascend
 :The brightest heaven of invention!
 :A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,

S:Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
 :

 :The flat unraised spirits that hath dared
 :
 :On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
 :
 :So great an object. Can this cockpit hold
 :The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram
 :Within this wooden O the very casques
 :That did affright the air at Agincourt?
 :O pardon, since a crooked figure may
 :Attest in little place a million,
S:
 :And let us, ciphers to this great account,
 :
 :On your imaginary forces work.
 :
 :Suppose within the girdle of these walls
 :
S:Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
 :
 :Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
 :
 :The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
 :
 :Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
S:Into a thousand parts divide one man,

 :
 :Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
 :
 :Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth,
S:For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our

 :
 :Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
 :
 :Turning th' accomplishment of many years
 :Into an hourglass; for the which supply,
 :Admit me chorus to this history,

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :My lord, I'll tell you that self bill is urged
 :Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign
S:Was like, and had indeed against us passed
 :
 :But that the scambling and unquiet time
 :
 :Did push it out of farther question.
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
 :
S:BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
 :
 :We lose the better half of our possession,
 :
 :For all the temporal lands which men devout
 :By testament have given to the Church
 :Would they strip from us, being valued thus:
 :"As much as would maintain, to the King's honor,
S:Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
 :
 :Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
 :
 :And, to relief of lazars and weak age
 :
 :Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
 :A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
 :And to the coffers of the King besides,
 :A thousand pounds by th' year." Thus runs the bill.
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
S:
 :This would drink deep.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY  'Twould drink the cup and
 :
 :all.
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY  But what prevention?
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
S:
 :The King is full of grace and fair regard.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :
S:And a true lover of the holy Church.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :The courses of his youth promised it not.
 :The breath no sooner left his father's body
 :But that his wildness, mortified in him,
 :Seemed to die too. Yea, at that very moment
 :Consideration like an angel came
S:And whipped th' offending Adam out of him,
 :
 :Leaving his body as a paradise
 :
S:T' envelop and contain celestial spirits.
 :
 :Never was such a sudden scholar made,
 :
 :Never came reformation in a flood
 :
 :With such a heady currance scouring faults,
 :Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness
 :So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,
 :As in this king.
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY  We are blessed in the change.
S:
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :Hear him but reason in divinity
 :
 :And, all-admiring, with an inward wish
 :You would desire the King were made a prelate;
S:Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
 :
 :You would say it hath been all in all his study;
 :
S:List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
 :
 :A fearful battle rendered you in music;
 :
 :Turn him to any cause of policy,
 :
 :The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
 :Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,
 :The air, a chartered libertine, is still,
S:And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
 :
 :To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;
 :
 :So that the art and practic part of life
 :
 :Must be the mistress to this theoric;
 :Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,
 :Since his addiction was to courses vain,
 :His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,
 :His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,
 :And never noted in him any study,
S:
 :Any retirement, any sequestration
 :
 :From open haunts and popularity.
 :
 :
 :
S:BISHOP OF ELY
 :
 :The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
 :
 :And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
 :
 :Neighbored by fruit of baser quality;
 :And so the Prince obscured his contemplation
S:Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,
 :
S:Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
 :
 :Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :It must be so, for miracles are ceased,
 :And therefore we must needs admit the means
S:How things are perfected.
 :
S:
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY  But, my good lord,
 :
 :How now for mitigation of this bill
 :
 :Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty
 :Incline to it or no?
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY  He seems indifferent,
 :Or rather swaying more upon our part
 :Than cherishing th' exhibitors against us;
S:
 :For I have made an offer to his Majesty--
 :
 :Upon our spiritual convocation
 :
 :And in regard of causes now in hand,
 :
 :Which I have opened to his Grace at large,
 :As touching France--to give a greater sum
 :Than ever at one time the clergy yet
S:Did to his predecessors part withal.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :
 :How did this offer seem received, my lord?
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
S:With good acceptance of his Majesty--
 :
 :Save that there was not time enough to hear,
 :
S:As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,
 :
 :The severals and unhidden passages
 :
 :Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,
 :
 :And generally to the crown and seat of France,
S:Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :
 :What was th' impediment that broke this off?
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :The French ambassador upon that instant
 :Craved audience. And the hour, I think, is come
 :To give him hearing. Is it four o'clock?
S:
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY  It is.
 :
 :
 :
S:BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :Then go we in to know his embassy,
 :
 :Which I could with a ready guess declare
 :
S:Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
 :
S:
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :
 :I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter the King of England, Humphrey Duke of
 :Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmoreland,
S:
 :and Exeter, with other Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
 :
 :EXETER
 :Not here in presence.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Send for him, good uncle.
 :
 :
 :
S:WESTMORELAND
 :
 :Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my liege?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,
 :Before we hear him, of some things of weight
 :That task our thoughts concerning us and France.
 :
S:[Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :God and his angels guard your sacred throne
 :And make you long become it.
 :
 :KING HENRY  Sure we thank you.
 :My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
S:
S:And justly and religiously unfold
 :
 :Why the law Salic that they have in France
 :
 :Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
 :
S:And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
 :
 :That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your
 :
 :reading,
 :
 :Or nicely charge your understanding soul
 :With opening titles miscreate, whose right
 :Suits not in native colors with the truth;
 :For God doth know how many now in health
 :Shall drop their blood in approbation
 :Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
S:
 :Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
 :
 :How you awake our sleeping sword of war.
 :
 :We charge you in the name of God, take heed,
 :
S:For never two such kingdoms did contend
 :
 :Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops
 :
 :Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
 :
 :'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the
 :swords
 :That makes such waste in brief mortality.
S:Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,
 :
 :For we will hear, note, and believe in heart
 :
 :That what you speak is in your conscience washed
 :
 :As pure as sin with baptism.
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
S:Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers
 :
 :That owe yourselves, your lives, and services
 :
 :To this imperial throne. There is no bar
 :
 :To make against your Highness' claim to France
S:But this, which they produce from Pharamond:
 :
 :"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant
 :
 :(No woman shall succeed in Salic land),
 :
 :Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze
 :To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
 :The founder of this law and female bar.
 :Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
 :That the land Salic is in Germany,
 :Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,
S:
 :Where Charles the Great, having subdued the
 :
 :Saxons,
 :
 :There left behind and settled certain French,
 :
 :Who, holding in disdain the German women
S:For some dishonest manners of their life,
 :
S:Established then this law: to wit, no female
 :
 :Should be inheritrix in Salic land,
 :
 :Which "Salic," as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala
 :
 :Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.
 :Then doth it well appear the Salic law
 :Was not devised for the realm of France,
 :Nor did the French possess the Salic land
 :Until four hundred one and twenty years
 :After defunction of King Pharamond,
S:
 :Idly supposed the founder of this law,
 :
S:Who died within the year of our redemption
 :
 :Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
 :
S:Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French
 :
 :Beyond the river Sala in the year
 :
 :Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
 :
 :King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
 :Did, as heir general, being descended
 :Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
S:Make claim and title to the crown of France.
 :
 :Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
 :
 :Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
 :
 :Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
 :To find his title with some shows of truth,
 :Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
S:Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare,
 :
 :Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son
 :
 :To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
 :
 :Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
 :Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
 :Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
S:Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
 :
 :That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
 :
 :Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
 :
S:Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:
 :
 :By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
 :
 :Was reunited to the crown of France.
 :
 :So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
 :King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
 :King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
 :To hold in right and title of the female.
 :So do the kings of France unto this day,
 :Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law
S:
S:To bar your Highness claiming from the female,
 :
 :And rather choose to hide them in a net
 :
 :Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
 :
 :Usurped from you and your progenitors.
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:May I with right and conscience make this claim?
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,
 :For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:
 :"When the man dies, let the inheritance
 :Descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord,
 :Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,
 :Look back into your mighty ancestors.
S:
 :Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
 :
S:From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit
 :
 :And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
 :
 :Who on the French ground played a tragedy,
 :
 :Making defeat on the full power of France
 :Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
 :Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
 :Forage in blood of French nobility.
 :O noble English, that could entertain
 :With half their forces the full pride of France
S:
 :And let another half stand laughing by,
 :
 :All out of work and cold for action!
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
 :And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
 :You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,
 :The blood and courage that renowned them
S:
 :Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
 :
 :Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
 :
 :Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
 :
S:
 :
 :EXETER
 :
 :Your brother kings and monarchs of the Earth
 :
 :Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
S:As did the former lions of your blood.
 :
 :
 :
 :WESTMORELAND
 :
 :They know your Grace hath cause and means and
 :might;
 :So hath your Highness. Never king of England
 :Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects,
 :Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
S:And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
 :
 :
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
 :With blood and sword and fire to win your right,
 :In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
 :Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
 :As never did the clergy at one time
 :Bring in to any of your ancestors.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :We must not only arm t' invade the French,
 :
 :But lay down our proportions to defend
S:Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
 :
 :With all advantages.
 :
 :
 :
S:BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
 :
 :They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
 :
S:Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
 :
 :Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
 :
 :But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
 :Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.
 :For you shall read that my great-grandfather
 :Never went with his forces into France
 :But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom
S:Came pouring like the tide into a breach
 :
 :With ample and brim fullness of his force,
 :
 :Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
 :
 :Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,
 :That England, being empty of defense,
 :Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood.
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY
S:She hath been then more feared than harmed, my
 :
 :liege,
 :
 :For hear her but exampled by herself:
 :
 :When all her chivalry hath been in France
 :And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
 :She hath herself not only well defended
 :But taken and impounded as a stray
S:The King of Scots, whom she did send to France
 :
S:To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
 :
 :And make her chronicle as rich with praise
 :
 :As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
 :
 :With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.
S:
 :
 :BISHOP OF ELY
 :
 :But there's a saying very old and true:
 :
 :"If that you will France win,
S:Then with Scotland first begin."
 :
 :For once the eagle England being in prey,
 :
 :To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
 :
 :Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
 :Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
 :To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat.
 :
 :EXETER
 :It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.
S:
 :Yet that is but a crushed necessity,
 :
 :Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
 :
 :And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
 :
S:While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
 :
 :Th' advised head defends itself at home.
 :
 :For government, though high and low and lower,
 :
 :Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
 :Congreeing in a full and natural close,
 :Like music.
 :
 :BISHOP OF CANTERBURY  Therefore doth heaven divide
S:The state of man in divers functions,
 :
 :Setting endeavor in continual motion,
 :
 :To which is fixed as an aim or butt
 :
 :Obedience; for so work the honeybees,
S:Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
 :
 :The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
 :
 :They have a king and officers of sorts,
 :
 :Where some like magistrates correct at home,
 :Others like merchants venture trade abroad,
 :Others like soldiers armed in their stings
 :Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
 :Which pillage they with merry march bring home
S:To the tent royal of their emperor,
 :
 :Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
 :
 :The singing masons building roofs of gold,
 :
 :The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
 :The poor mechanic porters crowding in
 :Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
 :The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum
 :Delivering o'er to executors pale
 :The lazy yawning drone. I this infer:
S:
 :That many things, having full reference
 :
 :To one consent, may work contrariously,
 :
 :As many arrows loosed several ways
 :
S:Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,
 :
 :As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,
 :
 :As many lines close in the dial's center,
 :
 :So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
S:End in one purpose and be all well borne
 :
 :Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!
 :
 :Divide your happy England into four,
 :
 :Whereof take you one quarter into France,
 :And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
 :If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
 :Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
 :Let us be worried, and our nation lose
S:The name of hardiness and policy.
 :

S:Ruling in large and ample empery

 :Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
 :As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.
 :Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
 :Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
 :
S:
 :AMBASSADOR  Thus, then, in few:
 :
 :Your Highness, lately sending into France,
 :
 :Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
 :
 :Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third;
 :In answer of which claim, the Prince our master
 :Says that you savor too much of your youth
 :And bids you be advised there's naught in France
 :That can be with a nimble galliard won;
S:
 :You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
 :
 :He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
 :
 :This tun of treasure and, in lieu of this,
 :
 :Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
S:Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :What treasure, uncle?
 :
 :EXETER  Tennis balls,
 :my liege.
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:
 :We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
 :
 :His present and your pains we thank you for.
 :
 :When we have matched our rackets to these balls,
 :
 :We will in France, by God's grace, play a set
 :Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
 :Tell him he hath made a match with such a
 :wrangler
 :That all the courts of France will be disturbed
S:
 :With chases. And we understand him well,
 :
 :How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
 :
 :Not measuring what use we made of them.
 :
 :We never valued this poor seat of England,
 :And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
S:To barbarous license, as 'tis ever common
 :
 :That men are merriest when they are from home.
 :
 :But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
 :
 :Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness
S:When I do rouse me in my throne of France,
 :
 :For that I have laid by my majesty
 :
 :And plodded like a man for working days;
 :
 :But I will rise there with so full a glory
 :That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
 :Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
 :And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
 :Hath turned his balls to gun-stones, and his soul
 :Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
S:
 :That shall fly with them; for many a thousand
 :
 :widows
 :
 :Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,
 :
 :Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
 :And some are yet ungotten and unborn
S:That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
 :
 :But this lies all within the will of God,
 :
 :To whom I do appeal, and in whose name
 :
 :Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
 :To venge me as I may and to put forth
 :My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.
 :So get you hence in peace. And tell the Dauphin
 :His jest will savor but of shallow wit
 :When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.--
S:
 :Convey them with safe conduct.--Fare you well.
 :
 :[Ambassadors exit, with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER  This was a merry message.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :We hope to make the sender blush at it.
 :Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
S:
 :That may give furth'rance to our expedition;
 :
S:For we have now no thought in us but France,
 :
 :Save those to God, that run before our business.
 :
 :Therefore let our proportions for these wars
 :
 :Be soon collected, and all things thought upon
 :That may with reasonable swiftness add
 :More feathers to our wings. For, God before,
 :We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
S:Therefore let every man now task his thought,
 :
 :That this fair action may on foot be brought.
 :
 :[Flourish. They exit.]

S:ACT 2
 :
 :=====
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Chorus.]
 :
 :
 :CHORUS
 :Now all the youth of England are on fire,
S:
 :And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
 :
 :Now thrive the armorers, and honor's thought
 :
S:Reigns solely in the breast of every man.
 :
S:They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
 :
 :Following the mirror of all Christian kings
 :
 :With winged heels, as English Mercurys.
 :
 :For now sits Expectation in the air
 :And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point,
 :With crowns imperial, crowns, and coronets
 :Promised to Harry and his followers.
 :The French, advised by good intelligence
 :Of this most dreadful preparation,
S:
 :Shake in their fear, and with pale policy
 :
 :Seek to divert the English purposes.
 :
 :O England, model to thy inward greatness,
 :
 :Like little body with a mighty heart,
 :What might'st thou do, that honor would thee do,
 :Were all thy children kind and natural!
 :But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
 :A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
S:
 :With treacherous crowns, and three corrupted men--
 :
S:One, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
 :
 :Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
 :
 :Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland--
 :
S:Have, for the gilt of France (O guilt indeed!),
 :
 :Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France,
 :
 :And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
 :
S:If hell and treason hold their promises,
 :
 :Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
 :
 :Linger your patience on, and we'll digest
 :
 :Th' abuse of distance, force a play.
 :The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,
 :The King is set from London, and the scene
 :Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.
 :There is the playhouse now, there must you sit,
S:And thence to France shall we convey you safe
 :
 :And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
 :
 :To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
 :
 :We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
 :But, till the King come forth, and not till then,
 :Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

 :
S:[Enter Corporal Nym and Lieutenant Bardolph.]
 :
S:
 :
S:
 :
 :BARDOLPH  Well met, Corporal Nym.
 :
 :
 :
 :NYM  Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
S:
 :
 :BARDOLPH  What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends
 :
 :yet?
 :
 :
 :NYM  For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time
 :shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as
 :it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out
 :mine iron. It is a simple one, but what though? It
 :will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another
S:
S:man's sword will, and there's an end.
 :
 :
 :
 :BARDOLPH  I will bestow a breakfast to make you
 :
S:friends, and we'll be all three sworn brothers to
 :
 :France. Let 't be so, good Corporal Nym.
 :
 :
 :
 :NYM  Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
 :certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
 :will do as I may. That is my rest, that is the
S:rendezvous of it.
 :
 :
 :
S:BARDOLPH  It is certain, corporal, that he is married to
 :
 :Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for
 :
 :you were troth-plight to her.
 :
 :
S:NYM  I cannot tell. Things must be as they may. Men
 :
 :may sleep, and they may have their throats about
 :
 :them at that time, and some say knives have edges.
 :
 :It must be as it may. Though patience be a tired
 :mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions.
 :Well, I cannot tell.
 :
 :[Enter Pistol and Hostess Quickly.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :BARDOLPH  Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.
 :
 :Good corporal, be patient here.--How now, mine
 :
S:host Pistol?
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  Base tyke, call'st thou me host? Now, by this
 :
 :hand, I swear I scorn the term, nor shall my Nell
 :keep lodgers.
 :
 :HOSTESS  No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot
 :lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen
 :that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it
S:
 :will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
 :
 :[Nym and Pistol draw their swords.]
 :
 :O well-a-day, Lady! If he be not hewn now, we shall
 :
S:see willful adultery and murder committed.
 :
 :
 :
 :BARDOLPH  Good lieutenant, good corporal, offer nothing
 :
 :here.
 :
 :NYM  Pish!
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  Pish for thee, Iceland dog, thou prick-eared
 :
 :cur of Iceland!
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor, and put
 :up your sword.
S:
 :
 :NYM  Will you shog off? [To Pistol.] I would have you
 :
 :solus.
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  "Solus, egregious dog? O viper vile, the solus
 :in thy most marvelous face, the solus in thy teeth
 :and in thy throat and in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy
 :maw, perdy, and, which is worse, within thy nasty
S:mouth! I do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can
 :
 :take, and Pistol's cock is up, and flashing fire will
 :
S:follow.
 :
 :
 :
S:NYM  I am not Barbason, you cannot conjure me. I
 :
 :have an humor to knock you indifferently well. If
 :
 :you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with
 :
 :my rapier, as I may, in fair terms. If you would walk
 :off, I would prick your guts a little in good terms, as
 :I may, and that's the humor of it.
S:
 :
 :PISTOL
 :
 :O braggart vile and damned furious wight,
 :
 :The grave doth gape, and doting death is near.
 :Therefore exhale.
 :
 :BARDOLPH  Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes
 :the first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a
 :soldier.	[He draws.]
S:
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
 :
 :[Pistol and Nym and then Bardolph
 :
S:sheathe their swords.]
 :
 :Give me thy fist, thy forefoot to me give. Thy spirits
 :
 :are most tall.
 :
 :
 :NYM, [to Pistol]  I will cut thy throat one time or other
 :in fair terms, that is the humor of it.
 :
 :PISTOL  Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defy thee
 :again. O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to
S:
S:get? No, to the spital go, and from the powd'ring tub
 :
 :of infamy fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
 :
 :Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse. I
 :
 :have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly for the
 :only she: and pauca, there's enough too! Go to.
 :
S:[Enter the Boy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BOY  Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master,
 :and your hostess. He is very sick and would to
 :bed.--Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
 :sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan. Faith,
 :he's very ill.
 :
S:
 :BARDOLPH  Away, you rogue!
 :
 :
 :
S:HOSTESS  By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding
 :
 :one of these days. The King has killed his heart.
 :
 :Good husband, come home presently.
 :
 :[She exits with the Boy.]
S:
 :
 :BARDOLPH  Come, shall I make you two friends? We
 :
 :must to France together. Why the devil should we
 :
 :keep knives to cut one another's throats?
 :
 :PISTOL
 :Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on!
S:
 :
 :NYM  You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at
 :
 :betting?
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  Base is the slave that pays.
 :
 :NYM  That now I will have, that's the humor of it.
 :
 :PISTOL  As manhood shall compound. Push home.
S:
 :[They draw.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BARDOLPH, [drawing his sword]  By this sword, he that
 :
 :makes the first thrust, I'll kill him. By this sword, I
 :will.
 :
 :PISTOL, [sheathing his sword]  "Sword" is an oath, and
 :oaths must have their course.
S:
S:
 :
S:BARDOLPH  Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be
 :
 :friends; an thou wilt not, why then be enemies with
 :
 :me too. Prithee, put up.
 :
 :
 :PISTOL, [to Nym]  A noble shalt thou have, and present
S:pay, and liquor likewise will I give to thee, and
 :
 :friendship shall combine, and brotherhood. I'll live
 :
S:by Nym, and Nym shall live by me. Is not this just?
 :
 :For I shall sutler be unto the camp, and profits will
 :
 :accrue. Give me thy hand.
 :
 :
 :NYM  I shall have my noble?
 :
 :PISTOL  In cash, most justly paid.
 :
 :NYM  Well, then, that's the humor of 't.
S:
 :[Nym and Bardolph sheathe their swords.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Hostess.]
 :
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  As ever you come of women, come in quickly
 :to Sir John. Ah, poor heart, he is so shaked of a
 :burning quotidian-tertian that it is most lamentable
S:
 :to behold. Sweet men, come to him.
 :
 :
 :
S:NYM  The King hath run bad humors on the knight,
 :
 :that's the even of it.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  Nym, thou hast spoke the right. His heart is
 :fracted and corroborate.
 :
 :NYM  The King is a good king, but it must be as it may;
 :he passes some humors and careers.
 :
S:
S:PISTOL  Let us condole the knight, for, lambkins, we
 :

 :
 :'Fore God, his Grace is bold to trust these traitors.
 :
 :

S:EXETER
 :

 :Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,

 :That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
S:

 :
S:
 :
 :[Sound Trumpets. Enter the King of England,

 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.--
 :My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of
 :Masham,
S:
 :And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
 :
 :Think you not that the powers we bear with us
 :
 :Will cut their passage through the force of France,
 :
 :Doing the execution and the act
 :For which we have in head assembled them?
S:
 :
 :SCROOP
 :
 :No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
 :We carry not a heart with us from hence
 :That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
 :Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
S:
 :Success and conquest to attend on us.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMBRIDGE
 :
 :Never was monarch better feared and loved
 :Than is your Majesty. There's not, I think, a subject
 :That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
 :Under the sweet shade of your government.
S:
 :
 :GREY
 :
 :True. Those that were your father's enemies
 :
 :Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you
 :With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
 :And shall forget the office of our hand
S:
 :Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
 :
 :According to the weight and worthiness.
 :
 :
 :
 :SCROOP
 :So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
 :And labor shall refresh itself with hope
 :To do your Grace incessant services.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
S:We judge no less.--Uncle of Exeter,
 :
 :Enlarge the man committed yesterday
 :
 :That railed against our person. We consider
 :
 :It was excess of wine that set him on,
 :And on his more advice we pardon him.
 :
S:SCROOP
 :
 :That's mercy, but too much security.
 :
 :Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example
 :
 :Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

 :KING HENRY  O, let us yet be merciful.
 :
 :CAMBRIDGE
 :So may your Highness, and yet punish too.

S:After the taste of much correction.

 :
 :Alas, your too much love and care of me
S:Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch.
 :
S:If little faults proceeding on distemper
 :
 :Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye
 :
 :When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed, and
 :
 :digested,
 :Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
 :Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear
 :care
S:And tender preservation of our person,
 :
 :Would have him punished. And now to our French
 :
 :causes.
 :
 :Who are the late commissioners?

 :
 :We will aboard tonight.--Why how now, gentlemen?
 :
 :What see you in those papers, that you lose
S:So much complexion?--Look you, how they change.

 :Their cheeks are paper.--Why, what read you there
 :
 :That have so cowarded and chased your blood
 :
 :Out of appearance?

 :CAMBRIDGE  I do confess my fault,
 :And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.
S:
 :
 :GREY/SCROOP  To which we all appeal.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :The mercy that was quick in us but late
 :By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.
 :You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,
 :For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
S:As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.--
 :
 :See you, my princes and my noble peers,
 :
 :These English monsters. My Lord of Cambridge
 :
 :here,
 :You know how apt our love was to accord
 :To furnish him with all appurtenants
 :Belonging to his honor, and this man
 :Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired
 :And sworn unto the practices of France
S:
 :To kill us here in Hampton; to the which
 :
 :This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
 :
 :Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.--But O,
 :
S:What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,
 :
 :Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?
 :
 :Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
 :
 :That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
 :That almost mightst have coined me into gold,
 :Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use--
 :May it be possible that foreign hire
 :Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
 :That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange
S:
 :That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
 :
 :As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
 :
 :Treason and murder ever kept together,
 :
 :As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
 :Working so grossly in a natural cause
 :That admiration did not whoop at them.
 :But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
 :Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,
S:
 :And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 :
 :That wrought upon thee so preposterously
 :
 :Hath got the voice in hell for excellence.
 :
 :All other devils that suggest by treasons
 :Do botch and bungle up damnation
S:With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched
 :
 :From glist'ring semblances of piety;
 :
S:But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,
 :
 :Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
 :
 :Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
 :
 :If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus
 :Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
 :He might return to vasty Tartar back
 :And tell the legions "I can never win
 :A soul so easy as that Englishman's."
 :O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
S:
 :The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
 :
S:Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?
 :
 :Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?
 :
 :Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?
 :
 :Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
 :Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
 :Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
 :Garnished and decked in modest complement,
 :Not working with the eye without the ear,
 :And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
S:
 :Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.
 :
 :And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
 :
 :To mark the full-fraught man and best endued
 :
 :With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,
 :For this revolt of thine methinks is like
 :Another fall of man.--Their faults are open.
 :Arrest them to the answer of the law,
 :And God acquit them of their practices.
S:

 :
 :Our purposes God justly hath discovered,
 :And I repent my fault more than my death,
 :Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
 :Although my body pay the price of it.
S:
 :
 :CAMBRIDGE
 :
 :For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
 :
 :Although I did admit it as a motive
 :The sooner to effect what I intended;
 :But God be thanked for prevention,
 :Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
 :Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
 :
S:
 :GREY
 :
 :Never did faithful subject more rejoice
 :
 :At the discovery of most dangerous treason
 :
 :Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
 :Prevented from a damned enterprise.
 :My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :God quit you in His mercy. Hear your sentence:
 :
 :You have conspired against our royal person,
 :Joined with an enemy proclaimed, and from his
 :coffers
 :Received the golden earnest of our death,
 :Wherein you would have sold your king to
 :slaughter,
S:
 :His princes and his peers to servitude,
 :
 :His subjects to oppression and contempt,
 :
 :And his whole kingdom into desolation.
 :
 :Touching our person, seek we no revenge,
 :But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
 :Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
 :We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
 :Poor miserable wretches, to your death,
S:
 :The taste whereof God of His mercy give
 :
 :You patience to endure, and true repentance
 :
 :Of all your dear offenses.--Bear them hence.
 :
 :[They exit under guard.]
 :Now, lords, for France, the enterprise whereof
 :Shall be to you as us, like glorious.
 :We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
 :Since God so graciously hath brought to light
S:
 :This dangerous treason lurking in our way
 :
 :To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
 :
 :But every rub is smoothed on our way.
 :
 :Then forth, dear countrymen. Let us deliver
 :Our puissance into the hand of God,
 :Putting it straight in expedition.
S:Cheerly to sea. The signs of war advance.

 :him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers
S:and smile upon his finger's end, I knew there was
 :
 :but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen and
 :
 :he talked of green fields. "How now, Sir John?"
 :
 :quoth I. "What, man, be o' good cheer!" So he cried
 :out "God, God, God!" three or four times. Now I, to
 :comfort him, bid him he should not think of God; I
 :hoped there was no need to trouble himself with
 :any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more
S:clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and
 :
 :felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I
 :
 :felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and
 :
 :all was as cold as any stone.
 :
 :NYM  They say he cried out of sack.
 :
 :HOSTESS  Ay, that he did.
S:
 :
 :BARDOLPH  And of women.
 :
S:
 :
 :HOSTESS  Nay, that he did not.
 :
S:
 :
 :BOY  Yes, that he did, and said they were devils
 :
 :incarnate.
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  He could never abide carnation. 'Twas a
 :color he never liked.
 :
 :BOY  He said once, the devil would have him about
 :women.
S:
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  He did in some sort, indeed, handle women,
 :
 :but then he was rheumatic and talked of the Whore
 :
 :of Babylon.
 :
 :BOY  Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon
 :Bardolph's nose, and he said it was a black soul
 :burning in hell?
S:
 :
 :
S:BARDOLPH  Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that
 :
 :fire. That's all the riches I got in his service.
 :
 :
 :
 :NYM  Shall we shog? The King will be gone from
 :Southampton.
 :
 :PISTOL  Come, let's away.--My love, give me thy lips.
 :[They kiss.] Look to my chattels and my movables.
 :Let senses rule. The word is "Pitch and pay." Trust
S:
 :none, for oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
 :
S:and Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.
 :
 :Therefore, Caveto be thy counselor. Go, clear thy
 :

S:PISTOL  Touch her soft mouth, and march.

S:BARDOLPH, [kissing the Hostess]  Farewell, hostess.

S:Scene 4
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter the French King, the Dauphin, the Dukes
 :
 :of Berri and Brittany, the Constable, and others.]
 :
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :Thus comes the English with full power upon us,
 :And more than carefully it us concerns
S:
 :To answer royally in our defenses.
 :
 :Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany,
 :
 :Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
 :
 :And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
 :To line and new-repair our towns of war
 :With men of courage and with means defendant.
 :For England his approaches makes as fierce
 :As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
S:
 :It fits us then to be as provident
 :
 :As fear may teach us out of late examples
 :
 :Left by the fatal and neglected English
 :
 :Upon our fields.
 :
 :DAUPHIN  My most redoubted father,
 :It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe,
 :For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
S:
 :Though war nor no known quarrel were in question
 :
 :But that defenses, musters, preparations
 :
 :Should be maintained, assembled, and collected
 :
S:As were a war in expectation.
 :
 :Therefore I say 'tis meet we all go forth
 :
 :To view the sick and feeble parts of France.
 :
 :And let us do it with no show of fear,
 :No, with no more than if we heard that England
 :Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.
 :For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,
S:Her scepter so fantastically borne
 :
S:By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
 :
 :That fear attends her not.
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  O peace, Prince Dauphin!
 :You are too much mistaken in this king.
 :Question your Grace the late ambassadors
 :With what great state he heard their embassy,
 :How well supplied with noble councillors,
 :How modest in exception, and withal
S:
 :How terrible in constant resolution,
 :
 :And you shall find his vanities forespent
 :
 :Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
 :
 :Covering discretion with a coat of folly,
 :As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
 :That shall first spring and be most delicate.
 :
 :DAUPHIN
S:
 :Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
 :
 :But though we think it so, it is no matter.
 :
 :In cases of defense, 'tis best to weigh
 :
 :The enemy more mighty than he seems.
 :So the proportions of defense are filled,
 :Which of a weak and niggardly projection
 :Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
 :A little cloth.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE  Think we King Harry strong,
 :
 :And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
 :
 :The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us,
 :And he is bred out of that bloody strain
 :That haunted us in our familiar paths.
 :Witness our too-much-memorable shame
S:When Cressy battle fatally was struck
 :
 :And all our princes captived by the hand
 :
 :Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of
 :
 :Wales,
 :Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing
 :Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun,
 :Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
 :Mangle the work of nature and deface
 :The patterns that by God and by French fathers
S:
 :Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
 :
 :Of that victorious stock, and let us fear
 :
 :The native mightiness and fate of him.
 :
 :
S:[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :Ambassadors from Harry King of England
 :Do crave admittance to your Majesty.
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring
S:
 :them.	[Messenger exits.]
 :
 :You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.
 :
 :
 :
S:DAUPHIN
 :
 :Turn head and stop pursuit, for coward dogs
 :
S:Most spend their mouths when what they seem to
 :
 :threaten
 :
 :Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
 :
 :Take up the English short, and let them know
 :Of what a monarchy you are the head.
 :Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
 :As self-neglecting.
 :
 :[Enter Exeter, with Lords and Attendants.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE  From our brother of England?
 :
 :
 :EXETER
 :From him, and thus he greets your Majesty:
 :He wills you, in the name of God almighty,
 :That you divest yourself and lay apart
S:
 :The borrowed glories that, by gift of heaven,
 :
 :By law of nature and of nations, 'longs
 :
 :To him and to his heirs--namely, the crown
 :
 :And all wide-stretched honors that pertain
 :By custom and the ordinance of times
 :Unto the crown of France. That you may know
 :'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
 :Picked from the wormholes of long-vanished days
S:
 :Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
 :
 :He sends you this most memorable line,
 :
 :[He offers a paper.]
 :
 :In every branch truly demonstrative,
 :Willing you overlook this pedigree,
S:And when you find him evenly derived
 :
 :From his most famed of famous ancestors,
 :
 :Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
 :
 :Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
 :From him, the native and true challenger.
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE  Or else what follows?
S:
 :
 :EXETER
 :
 :Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown
 :
 :Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
 :Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
 :In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove,
 :That, if requiring fail, he will compel,
 :And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
S:Deliver up the crown and to take mercy
 :
 :On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
 :
 :Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head
 :
 :Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
 :The dead men's blood, the prived maidens'
 :groans,
 :For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers
 :That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
 :This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message--
S:
 :Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
 :
 :To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
S:For us, we will consider of this further.
 :
 :Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
 :
 :Back to our brother of England.
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN, [to Exeter]  For the Dauphin,
 :I stand here for him. What to him from England?
 :
S:EXETER
 :
 :Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
 :
 :And anything that may not misbecome
 :
 :The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
 :Thus says my king: an if your father's Highness
S:Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
 :
 :Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,
 :
 :He'll call you to so hot an answer of it
 :
 :That caves and womby vaultages of France
 :Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
 :In second accent of his ordinance.
 :
 :DAUPHIN
 :Say, if my father render fair return,
S:
 :It is against my will, for I desire
 :
 :Nothing but odds with England. To that end,
 :
S:As matching to his youth and vanity,
 :
 :I did present him with the Paris balls.
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER
S:He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
 :
 :Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.
 :
 :And be assured you'll find a difference,
 :
 :As we his subjects have in wonder found,
 :Between the promise of his greener days
 :And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
S:Even to the utmost grain. That you shall read
 :
 :In your own losses, if he stay in France.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :
 :Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.
 :
 :[Flourish.]
S:
 :
 :EXETER
 :
 :Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
 :
 :Come here himself to question our delay,
 :For he is footed in this land already.
 :
S:KING OF FRANCE
 :
 :You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions.
 :
S:A night is but small breath and little pause
 :
 :To answer matters of this consequence.

 :
 :
S:
 :[Enter Chorus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CHORUS
 :Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
 :In motion of no less celerity
 :Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
 :The well-appointed king at Dover pier
S:
 :Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet
 :
 :With silken streamers the young Phoebus
 :
 :fanning.
 :
 :Play with your fancies and in them behold,
 :Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.
 :Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give
 :To sounds confused. Behold the threaden sails,
S:Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind,
 :
 :Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,
 :
 :Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think
 :
 :You stand upon the rivage and behold
S:A city on th' inconstant billows dancing,
 :
 :For so appears this fleet majestical,
 :
 :Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
 :
 :Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
 :And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
 :Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
 :Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance,
 :For who is he whose chin is but enriched
 :With one appearing hair that will not follow
S:
 :These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
 :
 :Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
 :
 :Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
 :
 :With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
 :Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes
 :back,
 :Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
 :Katherine his daughter and with her, to dowry,
S:
S:Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
 :
 :The offer likes not, and the nimble gunner
 :
 :With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
 :
 :[Alarum, and chambers go off.]
 :And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
 :And eke out our performance with your mind.

S:
 :Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once

S:In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
 :
 :As modest stillness and humility,

 :
 :[Enter Nym, Bardolph, Pistol, and Boy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BARDOLPH  On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the
 :breach!
 :
 :NYM  Pray thee, corporal, stay. The knocks are too hot,
S:and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives.
 :
 :The humor of it is too hot; that is the very plainsong
 :
S:of it.
 :
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  "The plainsong" is most just, for humors do
 :
S:abound.
 :
S:Knocks go and come. God's vassals drop and die,
 :
 :[Sings]	   And sword and shield,
 :
 :In bloody field,
 :
 :Doth win immortal fame.
 :
 :BOY  Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would
 :give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
 :
S:PISTOL  And I.
 :
 :[Sings]	If wishes would prevail with me,
 :
 :My purpose should not fail with me,
 :
 :But thither would I hie.
 :
 :BOY [sings]	   As duly,
 :But not as truly,
 :As bird doth sing on bough.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Fluellen.
 :
 :]
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN
 :Up to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt, you cullions!
 :
 :PISTOL  Be merciful, great duke, to men of mold. Abate
 :thy rage, abate thy manly rage, abate thy rage, great
S:
 :duke. Good bawcock, 'bate thy rage. Use lenity,
 :
S:sweet chuck.
 :
 :
 :
 :NYM, [to Fluellen]  These be good humors. Your Honor
 :
 :wins bad humors.
 :[All but the Boy exit.]
 :
S:BOY  As young as I am, I have observed these three
 :
 :swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they
 :
S:three, though they would serve me, could not be
 :
 :man to me. For indeed three such antics do not
 :
 :amount to a man: for Bardolph, he is white-livered
 :
 :and red-faced, by the means whereof he faces it out
 :but fights not; for Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
 :and a quiet sword, by the means whereof he breaks
 :words and keeps whole weapons; for Nym, he hath
 :heard that men of few words are the best men, and
 :therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest he should
S:
 :be thought a coward, but his few bad words are
 :
S:matched with as few good deeds, for he never broke
 :
 :any man's head but his own, and that was against a
 :
 :post when he was drunk. They will steal anything
 :
 :and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute case, bore
 :it twelve leagues, and sold it for three halfpence.
 :Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching,
 :and in Calais they stole a fire shovel. I knew by that
 :piece of service the men would carry coals. They
 :would have me as familiar with men's pockets as
S:
 :their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes
 :
 :much against my manhood, if I should take from
 :
 :another's pocket to put into mine, for it is plain
 :
S:pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek
 :
 :some better service. Their villainy goes against my
 :
 :weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]
 :
 :
 :GOWER  Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to
S:
 :the mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak
 :
 :with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  To the mines? Tell you the Duke it is not so
 :good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines
 :is not according to the disciplines of the war. The
S:concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th'
 :
 :athversary, you may discuss unto the Duke, look
 :
 :you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.
 :
 :By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if
 :there is not better directions.
 :
 :GOWER  The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of
 :the siege is given, is altogether directed by an
S:Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
 :
 :
 :GOWER  I think it be.
S:
 :
S:FLUELLEN  By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world. I
 :
 :will verify as much in his beard. He has no more
 :
 :directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look
 :
 :you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
 :
 :[Enter Captain Macmorris, and Captain Jamy.]
 :
S:
 :
 :GOWER  Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain
 :
 :Jamy, with him.
 :
 :
S:FLUELLEN  Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman,
 :
 :that is certain, and of great expedition and
 :
 :knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
 :
 :knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will
 :maintain his argument as well as any military man
 :in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars
 :of the Romans.
 :
 :JAMY  I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
S:
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Godden to your Worship, good Captain
 :
 :James.
 :
 :
 :GOWER  How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit
 :the mines? Have the pioners given o'er?
 :
 :MACMORRIS  By Chrish, la, 'tish ill done. The work ish
S:
 :give over. The trompet sound the retreat. By my
 :
S:hand I swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill
 :
 :done. It ish give over. I would have blowed up the
 :
S:town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, 'tish ill
 :
 :done, 'tish ill done, by my hand, 'tish ill done.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,
 :
 :will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations
 :
 :with you as partly touching or concerning the
 :disciplines of the war, the Roman wars? In the way
 :of argument, look you, and friendly communication,
 :partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the
 :satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the
 :direction of the military discipline, that is the point.
S:
 :
 :
 :JAMY  It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captens bath,
 :
 :and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
 :
 :occasion, that sall I, marry.
 :
 :MACMORRIS  It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save
 :me. The day is hot, and the weather, and the wars,
 :and the King, and the dukes. It is no time to
S:
 :discourse. The town is beseeched. An the trumpet
 :
 :call us to the breach and we talk and, be Chrish, do
 :
 :nothing, 'tis shame for us all. So God sa' me, 'tis
 :
 :shame to stand still. It is shame, by my hand. And
S:there is throats to be cut, and works to be done,
 :
 :and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa' me, la.
 :
 :
 :
 :JAMY  By the Mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
 :to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or I'll lig i'
 :th' grund for it, ay, or go to death. And I'll pay 't as
 :valorously as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is the
S:breff and the long. Marry, I wad full fain heard
 :
 :some question 'tween you tway.
 :
S:
 :
S:FLUELLEN  Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under
 :
 :your correction, there is not many of your
 :
S:nation--
 :
S:
 :
 :MACMORRIS  Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a
 :
 :villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal. What
 :
 :ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
 :
S:than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I
 :
 :shall think you do not use me with that affability as,
 :
 :in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being
 :
 :as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
 :war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other
 :particularities.
 :
 :MACMORRIS  I do not know you so good a man as
 :myself. So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
S:
 :
 :
 :GOWER  Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
 :
S:
 :
 :JAMY  Ah, that's a foul fault.
 :
 :[A parley sounds.]
 :
 :
 :GOWER  The town sounds a parley.
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Captain Macmorris, when there is more
 :
 :better opportunity to be required, look you, I will
 :
 :be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of
 :war, and there is an end.

 :Scene 6
 :=======
 :[Enter Captains, English and Welsh, Gower and Fluellen.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :GOWER  How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from
 :
 :the bridge?
 :
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I assure you there is very excellent services
 :
 :committed at the bridge.
 :
 :
 :GOWER  Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
 :
 :FLUELLEN  The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as
 :Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with
 :my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and
S:
 :my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God
 :
 :be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but
 :
 :keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent
 :
S:discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at
 :
 :the pridge; I think in my very conscience he is as
 :
 :valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no
 :
 :estimation in the world, but I did see him do as
 :gallant service.
 :
 :GOWER  What do you call him?
 :
S:FLUELLEN  He is called Aunchient Pistol.
 :
 :
 :
 :GOWER  I know him not.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pistol.]
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Here is the man.
 :
S:
 :PISTOL  Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors. The
 :
S:Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some
 :
 :love at his hands.
 :
 :PISTOL  Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart and
 :of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate and giddy
 :Fortune's furious fickle wheel, that goddess blind,
 :that stands upon the rolling restless stone--
S:
S:
 :
S:FLUELLEN  By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune
 :
 :is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
 :
 :signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
 :
 :painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is
 :the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant,
 :and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you,
 :is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls
 :and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most
 :excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent
S:
 :moral.
 :
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him,
 :
 :for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be. A
 :
 :damned death! Let gallows gape for dog, let man go
 :free, and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate. But
 :Exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little
 :price. Therefore go speak; the Duke will hear thy
 :voice, and let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
 :with edge of penny cord and vile reproach. Speak,
S:
 :captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand
 :
 :your meaning.
 :
 :PISTOL  Why then, rejoice therefore.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to
S:
 :rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I
 :
 :would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and
 :
 :put him to execution, for discipline ought to be
 :
S:used.
 :
 :
 :
S:PISTOL  Die and be damned, and figo for thy friendship!
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  It is well.
 :
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  The fig of Spain!	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Very good.
 :
 :GOWER  Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal. I
 :remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I'll assure you he uttered as prave words at
S:
S:the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
 :
 :is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I
 :
 :warrant you, when time is serve.
 :
 :
S:GOWER  Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and
 :
 :then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
 :
S:into London under the form of a soldier; and such
 :
 :fellows are perfect in the great commanders'
 :
 :names, and they will learn you by rote where
 :
S:services were done--at such and such a sconce, at
 :
 :such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off
 :
S:bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms
 :
S:the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in
 :
 :the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned
 :
 :oaths; and what a beard of the general's cut
 :
 :and a horrid suit of the camp will do among
 :foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to
 :be thought on. But you must learn to know such
 :slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously
 :mistook.
 :
S:
S:FLUELLEN  I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive
 :
 :he is not the man that he would gladly make
 :
 :show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I
 :
 :will tell him my mind.
 :
 :[Drum and Colors. Enter the King of England and his
 :poor Soldiers, and Gloucester.]
S:
 :
 :Hark you, the King is coming, and I must speak
 :
 :with him from the pridge.--God pless your
 :
 :Majesty.
 :
 :KING HENRY  How now, Fluellen, cam'st thou from the
 :bridge?
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of
S:
 :Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.
 :
 :The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant
 :
 :and most prave passages. Marry, th' athversary was
 :
 :have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced
 :to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
 :pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave
 :man.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY  What men have you lost, Fluellen?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  The perdition of th' athversary hath been
 :
 :very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I
 :think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is
 :like to be executed for robbing a church, one
 :Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is
S:all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o'
 :
 :fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a
 :
S:coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but
 :
 :his nose is executed, and his fire's out.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  We would have all such offenders so cut
 :off; and we give express charge that in our marches
 :through the country there be nothing compelled
 :from the villages, nothing taken but paid for,
 :none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
 :language; for when lenity and cruelty play
S:
 :for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest
 :
 :winner.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Tucket. Enter Montjoy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MONTJOY  You know me by my habit.
 :
 :KING HENRY  Well then, I know thee. What shall I know
 :of thee?
 :
 :MONTJOY  My master's mind.
S:
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  Unfold it.
 :
 :
 :
 :MONTJOY  Thus says my king: "Say thou to Harry of
 :
 :England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
S:Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him
 :
 :we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
 :
 :thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
 :
 :ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is
S:imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his
 :
 :weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
 :
 :therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion
 :
 :the losses we have borne, the subjects we
 :have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in
 :weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under.
 :For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th'
 :effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom
 :too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
S:
 :person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless
 :
 :satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him,
 :
 :for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers,
 :
 :whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my
 :king and master; so much my office.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :What is thy name? I know thy quality.
S:
 :
 :
S:MONTJOY  Montjoy.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
 :And tell thy king I do not seek him now
 :But could be willing to march on to Calais
S:Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth,
 :
 :Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
 :
 :Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
 :
 :My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
 :My numbers lessened, and those few I have
 :Almost no better than so many French,
 :Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
 :I thought upon one pair of English legs
S:Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,
 :
 :That I do brag thus. This your air of France
 :
 :Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent.
 :
 :Go therefore, tell thy master: here I am.
S:My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
 :
 :My army but a weak and sickly guard,
 :
 :Yet, God before, tell him we will come on
 :
 :Though France himself and such another neighbor
 :Stand in our way. There's for thy labor, Montjoy.
 :[Gives money.]
 :Go bid thy master well advise himself:
 :If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,
 :We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
S:
 :Discolor. And so, Montjoy, fare you well.
 :
 :The sum of all our answer is but this:
 :
 :We would not seek a battle as we are,
 :
 :Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.
 :So tell your master.
 :
 :MONTJOY
S:I shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.
 :
S:[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :
 :I hope they will not come upon us now.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
S:March to the bridge. It now draws toward night.
 :
 :Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
 :
 :And on tomorrow bid them march away.

 :Scene 7
 :=======
 :[Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures,
 :Orleans, Dauphin, with others.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Tut, I have the best armor of the world.
 :
S:Would it were day!
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  You have an excellent armor, but let my
 :
 :horse have his due.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  It is the best horse of Europe.
 :
 :ORLEANS  Will it never be morning?
 :
S:
S:DAUPHIN  My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable,
 :
 :you talk of horse and armor?
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLEANS  You are as well provided of both as any
 :
 :prince in the world.
 :
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN  What a long night is this! I will not change
S:my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
 :
 :Ca, ha! He bounds from the earth, as if his
 :
 :entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui
 :
 :a les narines de feu. When I bestride him, I soar; I
S:am a hawk; he trots the air. The earth sings when he
 :
 :touches it. The basest horn of his hoof is more
 :
 :musical than the pipe of Hermes.
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  He's of the color of the nutmeg.
S:
 :
 :DAUPHIN  And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
 :
 :Perseus. He is pure air and fire, and the dull
 :
S:elements of earth and water never appear in him,
 :
 :but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
 :
 :him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you
 :
 :may call beasts.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and
 :excellent horse.
 :
S:DAUPHIN  It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like
 :
 :the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance
 :
 :enforces homage.
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  No more, cousin.
 :
 :DAUPHIN  Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from
 :the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb,
 :vary deserved praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as
S:
 :fluent as the sea. Turn the sands into eloquent
 :
 :tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. 'Tis
 :
 :a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a
 :
S:sovereign's sovereign to ride on, and for the world,
 :
 :familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their
 :
 :particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ
 :
 :a sonnet in his praise and began thus: "Wonder of
 :nature--"
 :
 :ORLEANS  I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's
 :mistress.
 :
S:
 :DAUPHIN  Then did they imitate that which I composed
 :
 :to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
 :
 :
 :
S:ORLEANS  Your mistress bears well.
 :
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN  Me well--which is the prescript praise and
 :
 :perfection of a good and particular mistress.
 :
S:CONSTABLE  Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress
 :
 :shrewdly shook your back.
 :
 :
 :
S:DAUPHIN  So perhaps did yours.
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Mine was not bridled.
 :
 :
S:DAUPHIN  O, then belike she was old and gentle, and
 :
 :you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose
 :
 :off, and in your strait strossers.
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  You have good judgment in horsemanship.
 :
 :DAUPHIN  Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and
 :ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
 :my horse to my mistress.
S:
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
 :
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN  I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his
 :own hair.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  I could make as true a boast as that if I had
 :a sow to my mistress.
S:
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN  "Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement,
 :
 :et la truie lavee au bourbier." Thou mak'st use
 :
 :of anything.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress,
 :or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
S:
 :
 :RAMBURES  My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in
 :
 :your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
 :
 :
S:CONSTABLE  Stars, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN  Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  And yet my sky shall not want.

 :
S:

S:ORLEANS  The Dauphin longs for morning.

S:prince.

S:
 :
 :ORLEANS  He is simply the most active gentleman of

 :France.
 :
 :
S:CONSTABLE  Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  He never did harm, that I heard of.
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Nor will do none tomorrow. He will keep
 :that good name still.
 :
 :ORLEANS  I know him to be valiant.
 :
S:
 :CONSTABLE  I was told that by one that knows him
 :
 :better than you.
 :
S:
 :
S:ORLEANS  What's he?
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Marry, he told me so himself, and he said
 :
 :he cared not who knew it.
 :
 :ORLEANS  He needs not. It is no hidden virtue in him.
S:
 :
 :CONSTABLE  By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody
 :
 :saw it but his lackey. 'Tis a hooded valor, and when
 :
S:it appears, it will bate.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  Ill will never said well.
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  I will cap that proverb with "There is
 :flattery in friendship."
 :
 :ORLEANS  And I will take up that with "Give the devil

S:
 :
 :
S:CONSTABLE  Well placed; there stands your friend for

S:"A fool's bolt is soon shot."

S:CONSTABLE  Who hath measured the ground?

 :
 :MESSENGER  The Lord Grandpre.
 :
 :
S:CONSTABLE  A valiant and most expert gentleman.--
 :
 :Would it were day! Alas, poor Harry of England! He
 :
 :longs not for the dawning as we do.
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  What a wretched and peevish fellow is this
 :King of England to mope with his fat-brained
 :followers so far out of his knowledge.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  If the English had any apprehension, they
S:
S:would run away.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  That they lack; for if their heads had any
 :
 :intellectual armor, they could never wear such
 :heavy headpieces.
 :
 :RAMBURES  That island of England breeds very valiant
 :creatures. Their mastiffs are of unmatchable
 :courage.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  Foolish curs, that run winking into the
 :
S:mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads
 :
S:crushed like rotten apples. You may as well say
 :
 :that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
 :
 :lip of a lion.
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Just, just; and the men do sympathize with
 :the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on,
 :leaving their wits with their wives. And then give
 :them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they
S:will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORLEANS  Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of
 :
 :beef.
 :
 :CONSTABLE  Then shall we find tomorrow they have
 :only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it
 :time to arm. Come, shall we about it?
 :
S:
 :ORLEANS
 :
S:It is now two o'clock. But, let me see, by ten

 :We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

S:ACT 4
 :
 :=====
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Chorus.]
 :
S:
 :
 :CHORUS
 :
 :Now entertain conjecture of a time
 :
 :When creeping murmur and the poring dark
 :Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
 :From camp to camp, through the foul womb of
 :night,
 :The hum of either army stilly sounds,
 :That the fixed sentinels almost receive
S:
 :The secret whispers of each other's watch.
 :
 :Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
 :
S:Each battle sees the other's umbered face;
 :
 :Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
 :
S:Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents
 :
 :The armorers, accomplishing the knights,
 :
S:With busy hammers closing rivets up,
 :
 :Give dreadful note of preparation.
 :
 :The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
 :
 :And, the third hour of drowsy morning named,
 :Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
 :The confident and overlusty French
 :Do the low-rated English play at dice
 :And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night,
S:Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
 :
 :So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
 :
 :Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
 :
 :Sit patiently and inly ruminate
 :The morning's danger; and their gesture sad,
 :Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,
 :Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
S:So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
 :
S:The royal captain of this ruined band
 :
 :Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
 :
 :Let him cry, "Praise and glory on his head!"
 :
 :For forth he goes and visits all his host,
 :Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,
 :And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
 :Upon his royal face there is no note
 :How dread an army hath enrounded him,
 :Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color
S:
 :Unto the weary and all-watched night,
 :
 :But freshly looks and overbears attaint
 :
 :With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,
 :
 :That every wretch, pining and pale before,
 :Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.
 :A largesse universal, like the sun,
 :His liberal eye doth give to everyone,
 :Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all
S:
 :Behold, as may unworthiness define,
 :
S:A little touch of Harry in the night.
 :
 :And so our scene must to the battle fly,
 :
 :Where, O for pity, we shall much disgrace,
 :
 :With four or five most vile and ragged foils
 :Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
 :The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
S:Minding true things by what their mock'ries be.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter the King of England, Bedford, and Gloucester.]
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:
 :Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger.
 :
 :The greater therefore should our courage be.--
 :
 :Good morrow, brother Bedford. God almighty,
 :
 :There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
 :Would men observingly distill it out.
 :For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,
 :Which is both healthful and good husbandry.
 :Besides, they are our outward consciences
S:
 :And preachers to us all, admonishing
 :
 :That we should dress us fairly for our end.
 :
 :Thus may we gather honey from the weed
 :
 :And make a moral of the devil himself.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Erpingham.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
 :A good soft pillow for that good white head
 :Were better than a churlish turf of France.
 :
S:ERPINGHAM
 :
 :Not so, my liege, this lodging likes me better,
 :
S:Since I may say "Now lie I like a king."
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :'Tis good for men to love their present pains
 :Upon example. So the spirit is eased;
 :And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt,
 :The organs, though defunct and dead before,
 :Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
 :With casted slough and fresh legerity.
S:
 :Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
 :
 :[He puts on Erpingham's cloak.]
 :
 :Brothers both,
 :
 :Commend me to the princes in our camp,
 :Do my good morrow to them, and anon
 :Desire them all to my pavilion.
 :
 :GLOUCESTER  We shall, my liege.
S:
 :
 :
 :ERPINGHAM  Shall I attend your Grace?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, my good knight.
 :Go with my brothers to my lords of England.
 :I and my bosom must debate awhile,
 :And then I would no other company.
 :
S:
 :ERPINGHAM
 :
 :The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.
 :
 :[All but the King exit.]
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:God-a-mercy, old heart, thou speak'st cheerfully.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pistol.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  Qui vous la?
 :
 :KING HENRY  A friend.
 :
S:
 :PISTOL  Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou
 :
 :base, common, and popular?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  I am a gentleman of a company.
 :
 :PISTOL  Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
 :
 :KING HENRY  Even so. What are you?
S:
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  As good a gentleman as the Emperor.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  Then you are a better than the King.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  The King's a bawcock and a heart of gold, a lad
 :
 :of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most
S:valiant. I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring I
 :
 :love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Harry le Roy.
 :
 :PISTOL  Le Roy? A Cornish name. Art thou of Cornish
 :crew?
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, I am a Welshman.
S:
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  Know'st thou Fluellen?
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  Yes.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate upon
 :
 :Saint Davy's day.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Do not you wear your dagger in your cap
 :
 :that day, lest he knock that about yours.
 :
 :
S:PISTOL  Art thou his friend?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  And his kinsman too.
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  The figo for thee then!
 :
 :KING HENRY  I thank you. God be with you.
 :
 :PISTOL  My name is Pistol called.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  It sorts well with your fierceness.
 :
S:[He steps aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]
 :
 :
 :
S:GOWER  Captain Fluellen.
 :
 :
 :
S:FLUELLEN  â€™So. In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer.
 :
 :It is the greatest admiration in the universal world
 :
 :when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and
 :
S:laws of the wars is not kept. If you would take the
 :
 :pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the
 :
 :Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is
 :
 :no tiddle taddle nor pibble babble in Pompey's
 :camp. I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies
 :of the wars and the cares of it and the forms
 :of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to
 :be otherwise.
 :
S:
 :GOWER  Why, the enemy is loud. You hear him all
 :
 :night.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
 :coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,
 :look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating
 :coxcomb, in your own conscience now?
 :
S:
 :GOWER  I will speak lower.
 :
 :
 :
S:FLUELLEN  I pray you and beseech you that you will.
 :
S:[Gower and Fluellen exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
S:Though it appear a little out of fashion,
 :
 :There is much care and valor in this Welshman.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter three Soldiers, John Bates, Alexander Court, and
 :
 :Michael Williams.]
 :
 :
 :
 :COURT  Brother John Bates, is not that the morning
S:which breaks yonder?
 :
 :
 :
 :BATES  I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire
 :
 :the approach of day.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  We see yonder the beginning of the day, but
 :I think we shall never see the end of it.--Who goes
 :there?
 :
S:
S:KING HENRY  A friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Under what captain serve you?
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
 :
S:
 :
 :WILLIAMS  A good old commander and a most kind
 :
 :gentleman. I pray you, what thinks he of our
 :
 :estate?
 :
 :KING HENRY  Even as men wracked upon a sand, that
 :look to be washed off the next tide.
 :
 :BATES  He hath not told his thought to the King?
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  No. Nor it is not meet he should, for,
 :
S:though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a
 :
 :man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to
 :
S:me. The element shows to him as it doth to me. All
 :
S:his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies
 :
 :laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man,
 :
 :and though his affections are higher mounted than
 :
 :ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like
S:wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we
 :
 :do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as
 :
S:ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him
 :
 :with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,
 :
S:should dishearten his army.
 :
 :
 :
 :BATES  He may show what outward courage he will,
 :
 :but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
 :himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would
 :he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were
S:quit here.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  By my troth, I will speak my conscience
 :
 :of the King. I think he would not wish himself
 :
 :anywhere but where he is.
 :
 :
S:BATES  Then I would he were here alone; so should he
 :
 :be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's
 :
S:lives saved.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  I dare say you love him not so ill to wish
 :
 :him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel
 :
 :other men's minds. Methinks I could not die anywhere
 :
 :so contented as in the King's company, his
 :cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
 :
S:WILLIAMS  That's more than we know.
 :
 :
 :
S:BATES  Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we
 :
 :know enough if we know we are the King's subjects.
 :
 :If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the
 :
 :King wipes the crime of it out of us.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  But if the cause be not good, the King
 :himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all
 :those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a
S:battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry
 :
 :all "We died at such a place," some swearing, some
 :
 :crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left
 :
 :poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe,
S:some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard
 :
 :there are few die well that die in a battle, for how
 :
S:can they charitably dispose of anything when blood
 :
 :is their argument? Now, if these men do not die
 :
 :well, it will be a black matter for the king that led
 :
 :them to it, who to disobey were against all proportion
S:of subjection.
 :
S:
 :
S:KING HENRY  So, if a son that is by his father sent about
 :
 :merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,
 :
 :the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,
 :
 :should be imposed upon his father that sent him.
S:Or if a servant, under his master's command transporting
 :
 :a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and
 :
 :die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
 :
 :business of the master the author of the servant's
 :damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound
 :to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the
 :father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for
 :they purpose not their death when they purpose
 :their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause
S:
 :never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of
 :
S:swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.
 :
 :Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of
 :
 :premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling
 :
 :virgins with the broken seals of perjury;
 :some, making the wars their bulwark, that have
S:before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage
 :
 :and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the
 :
 :law and outrun native punishment, though they can
 :
 :outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.
 :War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here
S:men are punished for before-breach of the King's
 :
 :laws in now the King's quarrel. Where they feared
 :
 :the death, they have borne life away; and where they
 :
 :would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided,
S:no more is the King guilty of their damnation
 :
 :than he was before guilty of those impieties for the
 :
 :which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is
 :
 :the King's, but every subject's soul is his own.
 :Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as
 :every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of
S:his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him
 :
 :advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost
 :
 :wherein such preparation was gained. And in him
 :
 :that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making
 :God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to
 :see His greatness and to teach others how they
S:should prepare.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill
 :
 :upon his own head; the King is not to answer it.
 :
 :BATES  I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet
 :I determine to fight lustily for him.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  I myself heard the King say he would not
 :
 :be ransomed.
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Ay, he said so to make us fight cheerfully,
 :but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed
 :and we ne'er the wiser.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  If I live to see it, I will never trust his
 :
 :word after.
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out
 :of an elder gun, that a poor and a private displeasure
 :can do against a monarch. You may as well go
 :about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face
 :with a peacock's feather. You'll "never trust his
S:
 :word after." Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Your reproof is something too round. I
 :
 :should be angry with you if the time were
 :
 :convenient.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  I embrace it.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  How shall I know thee again?
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear
 :
 :it in my bonnet. Then, if ever thou dar'st acknowledge
 :
 :it, I will make it my quarrel.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Here's my glove. Give me another of thine.
 :
 :KING HENRY  There.	[They exchange gloves.]
S:
 :
 :WILLIAMS  This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou
 :
 :come to me and say, after tomorrow, "This is my
 :
 :glove," by this hand I will take thee a box on the
 :ear.
 :
S:KING HENRY  If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Thou dar'st as well be hanged.
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the
 :King's company.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Keep thy word. Fare thee well.
 :
S:
 :BATES  Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We
 :
 :have French quarrels enough, if you could tell how
 :
 :to reckon.
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Indeed, the French may lay twenty
 :French crowns to one they will beat us, for they
 :bear them on their shoulders. But it is no English
S:treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the
 :
 :King himself will be a clipper.
 :
 :[Soldiers exit.]
 :
 :Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, our
 :debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins,
 :lay on the King!
S:We must bear all. O hard condition,
 :
 :Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
 :
 :Of every fool whose sense no more can feel
 :
 :But his own wringing. What infinite heart's ease
 :Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?
 :And what have kings that privates have not too,
 :Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
S:And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?
 :
 :What kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
 :
 :Of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers?
 :
S:What are thy rents? What are thy comings-in?
 :
 :O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
 :
 :What is thy soul of adoration?
 :
 :Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form,
 :Creating awe and fear in other men,
 :Wherein thou art less happy, being feared,
 :Than they in fearing?
 :What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
 :But poisoned flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
S:
 :And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
 :
S:Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
 :
 :With titles blown from adulation?
 :
 :Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
 :
 :Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's
 :knee,
 :Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
S:That play'st so subtly with a king's repose.
 :
 :I am a king that find thee, and I know
 :
 :'Tis not the balm, the scepter, and the ball,
 :
 :The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
 :The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
 :The farced title running 'fore the King,
S:The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
 :
 :That beats upon the high shore of this world;
 :
 :No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
 :
S:Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
 :
 :Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
 :
 :Who, with a body filled and vacant mind,
 :
 :Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread;
 :Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
 :But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
 :Sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night
S:Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn
 :
 :Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
 :
S:And follows so the ever-running year
 :
 :With profitable labor to his grave.
 :
 :And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
 :
 :Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
 :Had the forehand and vantage of a king.
 :The slave, a member of the country's peace,
 :Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots
 :What watch the King keeps to maintain the peace,
 :Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

S:O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.

S:Possess them not with fear. Take from them now
 :
 :The sense of reck'ning or th' opposed numbers
 :
S:Pluck their hearts from them. Not today, O Lord,
 :
 :O, not today, think not upon the fault
 :
 :My father made in compassing the crown.
 :
 :I Richard's body have interred new
 :And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
 :Than from it issued forced drops of blood.
 :Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
S:Who twice a day their withered hands hold up
 :
 :Toward heaven to pardon blood. And I have built
 :
 :Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
 :
 :Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do--
 :Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
 :Since that my penitence comes after all,
 :Imploring pardon.

S:DAUPHIN
 :
 :Montez a cheval! My horse, varlet! Lackey! Ha!

S:

 :ORLEANS  O brave spirit!

S:

 :
 :Now, my Lord Constable?
 :
S:
 :
 :CONSTABLE
 :
 :Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
 :
 :
 :DAUPHIN
 :Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
 :That their hot blood may spin in English eyes
 :And dout them with superfluous courage. Ha!
 :
S:
 :RAMBURES
 :
S:What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
 :
 :How shall we then behold their natural tears?

 :
 :
S:MESSENGER
 :
 :The English are embattled, you French peers.
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE
 :To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.
 :Do but behold yond poor and starved band,
 :And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
 :Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
 :There is not work enough for all our hands,
S:
S:Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
 :
 :To give each naked curtal ax a stain,
 :
 :That our French gallants shall today draw out
 :
S:And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on
 :
 :them,
 :
 :The vapor of our valor will o'erturn them.
 :
 :'Tis positive against all exceptions, lords,
 :That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
 :Who in unnecessary action swarm
 :About our squares of battle, were enough
 :To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
 :Though we upon this mountain's basis by
S:
 :Took stand for idle speculation,
 :
 :But that our honors must not. What's to say?
 :
 :A very little little let us do,
 :
S:And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
 :
 :The tucket sonance and the note to mount,
 :
 :For our approach shall so much dare the field
 :
 :That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
 :
 :[Enter Grandpre.]
 :
 :
 :GRANDPRE
S:
 :Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
 :
 :Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,
 :
 :Ill-favoredly become the morning field.
 :
S:Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
 :
 :And our air shakes them passing scornfully.
 :
 :Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host
 :
 :And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.
 :The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
S:With torch staves in their hand, and their poor jades
 :
S:Lob down their heads, drooping the hides and hips,
 :
 :The gum down-roping from their pale dead eyes,
 :
 :And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit
 :
 :Lies foul with chawed grass, still and motionless.
 :And their executors, the knavish crows,
 :Fly o'er them all, impatient for their hour.
 :Description cannot suit itself in words
 :To demonstrate the life of such a battle
S:In life so lifeless, as it shows itself.
 :
 :
 :
 :CONSTABLE
 :
 :They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
S:

S:Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,
 :
 :And give their fasting horses provender,
 :
 :And after fight with them?
 :
 :
S:CONSTABLE
 :
 :I stay but for my guard. On, to the field!

 :I will the banner from a trumpet take
 :
 :And use it for my haste. Come, come away.

 :If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,

 :Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with

S:
S:And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,

 :
S:

 :
 :Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today.

S:[Salisbury exits.]

 :
 :[Enter the King of England.]
 :
S:
 :
 :WESTMORELAND  O, that we now had here
 :
 :But one ten thousand of those men in England
 :
 :That do no work today.
 :
 :KING HENRY  What's he that wishes so?
 :My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin.
 :If we are marked to die, we are enough
 :To do our country loss; and if to live,
S:
S:The fewer men, the greater share of honor.
 :
 :God's will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
 :
 :By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
 :
S:Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
 :
 :It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
 :
 :Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
 :
 :But if it be a sin to covet honor,
 :I am the most offending soul alive.
 :No, 'faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
 :God's peace, I would not lose so great an honor
 :As one man more, methinks, would share from me,
 :For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
S:
 :Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
 :
 :That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
 :
 :Let him depart. His passport shall be made,
 :
 :And crowns for convoy put into his purse.
 :We would not die in that man's company
 :That fears his fellowship to die with us.
 :This day is called the feast of Crispian.
 :He that outlives this day and comes safe home
S:
 :Will stand o' tiptoe when this day is named
 :
 :And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
 :
S:He that shall see this day, and live old age,
 :
S:Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors
 :
 :And say "Tomorrow is Saint Crispian."
 :
 :Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
 :
 :Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
S:But he'll remember with advantages
 :
 :What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
 :
 :Familiar in his mouth as household words,
 :
 :Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
 :Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
 :Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
 :This story shall the good man teach his son,
 :And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
 :From this day to the ending of the world,
S:
 :But we in it shall be remembered--
 :
 :We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
 :
 :For he today that sheds his blood with me
 :
S:Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
 :
 :This day shall gentle his condition;
 :
 :And gentlemen in England now abed
 :
 :Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
 :And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
 :That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
 :
S:[Enter Salisbury.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SALISBURY
 :My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.
 :The French are bravely in their battles set,
 :And will with all expedience charge on us.
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:
 :All things are ready if our minds be so.
 :
 :
 :
 :WESTMORELAND
 :
 :Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
 :
S:
 :WESTMORELAND
 :
 :God's will, my liege, would you and I alone,
 :
 :Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Why, now thou hast unwished five thousand men,
 :Which likes me better than to wish us one.--
 :You know your places. God be with you all.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Tucket. Enter Montjoy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MONTJOY
 :Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
 :If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
S:Before thy most assured overthrow.
 :
S:For certainly thou art so near the gulf
 :
 :Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,
 :
 :The Constable desires thee thou wilt mind
 :
 :Thy followers of repentance, that their souls
S:May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
 :
 :From off these fields where, wretches, their poor
 :
S:bodies
 :
 :Must lie and fester.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Who hath sent thee now?
 :
S:MONTJOY  The Constable of France.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :I pray thee bear my former answer back.
 :Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
 :Good God, why should they mock poor fellows
 :thus?
 :The man that once did sell the lion's skin
 :While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.
S:
 :A many of our bodies shall no doubt
 :
 :Find native graves, upon the which, I trust,
 :
 :Shall witness live in brass of this day's work.
 :
 :And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
 :Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
 :They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet
 :them
 :And draw their honors reeking up to heaven,
S:
 :Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
 :
S:The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
 :
 :Mark, then, abounding valor in our English,
 :
 :That being dead, like to the bullet's crazing,
 :
S:Break out into a second course of mischief,
 :
 :Killing in relapse of mortality.
 :
S:Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable
 :
 :We are but warriors for the working day;
 :
 :Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched
 :
 :With rainy marching in the painful field.
S:There's not a piece of feather in our host--
 :
 :Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
 :
 :And time hath worn us into slovenry.
 :
 :But, by the Mass, our hearts are in the trim,
 :And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
 :They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
S:The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
 :
 :And turn them out of service. If they do this,
 :
 :As, if God please, they shall, my ransom then
 :
 :Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labor.
 :Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.
 :They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints,
 :Which, if they have, as I will leave 'em them,
 :Shall yield them little, tell the Constable.
 :
S:
 :MONTJOY
 :
 :I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well.
 :
S:Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  I fear thou wilt once more come again
 :
 :for a ransom.	[Montjoy exits.]
 :[Enter York.
 :]
 :
S:YORK, [kneeling]
 :
 :My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
 :
S:The leading of the vaward.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Take it, brave York.	[York rises.]
 :Now, soldiers, march away,
S:And how Thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.

S:

 :

 :FRENCH SOLDIER  O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de

 :
S:

 :I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty

S:

 :
S:this be if he durst steal anything adventurously. I

 :Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast,

 :Upon these words I came and cheered him up.

 :And with a feeble grip, says "Dear my lord,
 :Commend my service to my sovereign."
 :So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck
S:

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Fluellen and Gower.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Kill the poys and the luggage! 'Tis expressly
 :against the law of arms. 'Tis as arrant a piece of
 :knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your
S:conscience now, is it not?
 :
 :
 :
 :GOWER  'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive, and
 :
 :the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha'
 :done this slaughter. Besides, they have burned
 :and carried away all that was in the King's tent,
 :wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused
 :every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
S:gallant king!
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain
 :
 :Gower. What call you the town's name where
S:Alexander the Pig was born?
 :
 :
 :
 :GOWER  Alexander the Great.
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Why, I pray you, is not "pig" great? The pig,
S:or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
 :
 :magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the
 :
 :phrase is a little variations.
 :
S:
 :
 :GOWER  I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
 :
 :His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I
 :
 :take it.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is
 :porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of
 :the 'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
 :between Macedon and Monmouth, that the
S:
 :situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in
 :
 :Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at
 :
 :Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is
 :
 :out of my prains what is the name of the other river.
 :But 'tis all one; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my
 :fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark
 :Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is
 :come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in
S:
 :all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in
 :
 :his rages and his furies and his wraths and his
 :
 :cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his
 :
 :indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in
 :his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you,
 :kill his best friend, Cleitus.
 :
S:GOWER  Our king is not like him in that. He never
 :
 :killed any of his friends.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  It is not well done, mark you now, to take
 :the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and
 :finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons
 :of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in
 :his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth,
S:being in his right wits and his good judgments,
 :
 :turned away the fat knight with the great-belly
 :
 :doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries
 :
 :and mocks--I have forgot his name.
 :
 :GOWER  Sir John Falstaff.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  That is he. I'll tell you, there is good men
 :porn at Monmouth.
S:
 :
 :
 :GOWER  Here comes his Majesty.
 :
 :

S:

 :If they'll do neither, we will come to them

S:Enforced from the old Assyrian slings.
 :
 :Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,

 :
 :GLOUCESTER
 :His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
S:
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY
 :
 :How now, what means this, herald? Know'st thou
 :
 :not
 :
 :That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
 :Com'st thou again for ransom?
 :
 :MONTJOY  No, great king.
 :I come to thee for charitable license,
 :That we may wander o'er this bloody field
S:
 :To book our dead and then to bury them,
 :
 :To sort our nobles from our common men,
 :
S:For many of our princes--woe the while!--
 :
 :Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
 :
 :So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
 :
 :In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds
S:Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage
 :
 :Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
 :
 :Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
 :
S:To view the field in safety and dispose
 :
 :Of their dead bodies.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  I tell thee truly, herald,
S:I know not if the day be ours or no,
 :
 :For yet a many of your horsemen peer
 :
 :And gallop o'er the field.
 :
 :
 :MONTJOY  The day is yours.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
 :What is this castle called that stands hard by?
S:
 :
 :
 :MONTJOY  They call it Agincourt.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
 :
 :Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Your grandfather of famous memory, an 't
 :please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward
 :the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the
 :chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in
S:France.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  They did, Fluellen.
 :
 :
S:FLUELLEN  Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties
 :
 :is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good
 :
 :service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing
 :
 :leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty
 :know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the
 :service. And I do believe your Majesty takes no
 :scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day.
 :
S:KING HENRY
 :
 :I wear it for a memorable honor,
 :
 :For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  All the water in Wye cannot wash your
 :Majesty's Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell
S:you that. God pless it and preserve it as long as it
 :
 :pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Thanks, good my countryman.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  By Jeshu, I am your Majesty's countryman,
 :I care not who know it. I will confess it to all the
 :'orld. I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty,
S:praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an
 :
 :honest man.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :God keep me so.--Our heralds, go with him.
 :
 :Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
 :On both our parts.
 :[Montjoy, English Heralds, and Gower exit.]
 :
 :[Enter Williams.]
S:
 :
 :Call yonder fellow hither.
 :
 :
 :
 :EXETER  Soldier, you must come to the King.
 :
 :KING HENRY  Soldier, why wear'st thou that glove in thy
 :cap?
 :
 :WILLIAMS  An 't please your Majesty, 'tis the gage of
S:
 :one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  An Englishman?
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  An 't please your Majesty, a rascal that
 :swaggered with me last night, who, if alive and ever
 :dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take
 :him a box o' th' ear, or if I can see my glove in his
S:
 :cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would
 :
 :wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit
 :this soldier keep his oath?
 :
 :FLUELLEN  He is a craven and a villain else, an 't
 :please your Majesty, in my conscience.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  It may be his enemy is a gentleman of
 :
 :great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Though he be as good a gentleman as the
 :
 :devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is
 :
 :necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow
S:and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his
 :
 :reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as
 :
 :ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His
 :
 :earth, in my conscience, la.
 :
 :KING HENRY  Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou
 :meet'st the fellow.
 :
S:WILLIAMS  So I will, my liege, as I live.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Who serv'st thou under?
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Under Captain Gower, my liege.
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge
 :and literatured in the wars.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Call him hither to me, soldier.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  I will, my liege.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY, [giving Fluellen Williams's glove]  Here,
 :
 :Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me, and stick it in
 :
 :thy cap. When Alencon and myself were down
S:together, I plucked this glove from his helm. If any
 :
 :man challenge this, he is a friend to Alencon and an
 :
 :enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,
 :
 :apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
 :
 :FLUELLEN, [putting the glove in his cap]  Your Grace
 :does me as great honors as can be desired in the
 :hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that
 :has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at
S:
 :this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an
 :
 :please God of His grace that I might see.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Know'st thou Gower?
 :
S:FLUELLEN  He is my dear friend, an please you.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to
 :
 :my tent.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I will fetch him.	[He exits.]
 :
 :KING HENRY
S:My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,
 :
 :Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.
 :
 :The glove which I have given him for a favor
 :
 :May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.
 :It is the soldier's. I by bargain should
 :Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick.
 :If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
 :By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
 :Some sudden mischief may arise of it,
S:
 :For I do know Fluellen valiant
 :
S:And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
 :
 :And quickly will return an injury.
 :
 :Follow, and see there be no harm between them.--
 :
 :Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

 :
 :
 :
 :
S:FLUELLEN, [to Gower]  God's will and His pleasure,
 :
 :captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the
 :
 :King. There is more good toward you peradventure
 :
 :than is in your knowledge to dream of.
 :
 :WILLIAMS, [to Fluellen, pointing to the glove in his own
 :hat]  Sir, know you this glove?
 :
S:FLUELLEN  Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  I know this, and thus I challenge it.
 :
 :[Strikes him.]
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  'Sblood, an arrant traitor as any 's in the

 :universal world, or in France, or in England!
 :
 :
 :GOWER, [to Williams]  How now, sir? You villain!
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Do you think I'll be forsworn?
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Stand away, Captain Gower. I will give treason
S:
 :his payment into plows, I warrant you.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  I am no traitor.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  That's a lie in thy throat.--I charge you in

 :Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.
 :
 :WILLIAMS  My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow
 :of it. And he that I gave it to in change promised to
 :wear it in his cap. I promised to strike him if he did.
S:I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have
 :
 :been as good as my word.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty's
S:manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly,
 :
 :lousy knave it is. I hope your Majesty is pear me

 :this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty is give
 :me, in your conscience now.
 :
S:KING HENRY, [to Williams]  Give me thy glove, soldier.
 :
 :Look, here is the fellow of it.
 :
S:'Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike,
 :
 :And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
 :
 :
 :

S:for it, if there is any martial law in the world.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY, [to Williams]  How canst thou make me
 :
 :satisfaction?
 :
 :WILLIAMS  All offenses, my lord, come from the heart.
 :Never came any from mine that might offend your
 :Majesty.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY  It was ourself thou didst abuse.
 :
 :
 :
 :WILLIAMS  Your Majesty came not like yourself. You
 :
S:appeared to me but as a common man; witness the
 :
 :night, your garments, your lowliness. And what
 :
 :your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech
 :
 :you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had
S:you been as I took you for, I made no offense.
 :
 :Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.

S:Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns
 :
 :And give it to this fellow.--Keep it, fellow,
 :
 :And wear it for an honor in thy cap
 :

 :And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

 :FLUELLEN  By this day and this light, the fellow has
 :mettle enough in his belly.--Hold, there is twelvepence
 :for you, and I pray you to serve God and keep
S:
 :you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and

S:dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for

 :Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,

 :
 :So swift a pace hath thought that even now
 :
 :You may imagine him upon Blackheath,
 :
 :Where that his lords desire him to have borne
 :His bruised helmet and his bended sword
 :Before him through the city. He forbids it,

 :
S:
 :
 :GOWER  Nay, that's right. But why wear you your leek
 :
 :today? Saint Davy's day is past.
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  There is occasions and causes why and
 :wherefore in all things. I will tell you ass my

S:
 :a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to
 :
 :me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look

S:
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave,

S:

 :FLUELLEN  You say very true, scald knave, when God's
 :
 :will is. I will desire you to live in the meantime and
 :
 :eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce for it. [Strikes
 :him.] You called me yesterday "mountain squire,"
 :but I will make you today a squire of low degree. I
 :pray you, fall to. If you can mock a leek, you can eat
 :a leek.
 :
S:
 :GOWER  Enough, captain. You have astonished him.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  I say I will make him eat some part of my
 :
 :leek, or I will peat his pate four days.--Bite, I pray
 :you. It is good for your green wound and your
 :ploody coxcomb.
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  Must I bite?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of
S:question, too, and ambiguities.
 :
 :
 :
 :PISTOL  By this leek, I will most horribly revenge.
 :
S:[Fluellen threatens him.] I eat and eat, I swear--
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more
 :
 :sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to
 :swear by.
S:
 :
 :PISTOL  Quiet thy cudgel. Thou dost see I eat.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.
 :Nay, pray you throw none away. The skin is good for
 :your broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to
 :see leeks hereafter, I pray you mock at 'em, that is
 :all.
 :
S:
 :PISTOL  Good.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat
 :
S:to heal your pate.
 :
 :

 :PISTOL  Me, a groat?
 :
 :
 :FLUELLEN  Yes, verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I

 :eat.

S:

 :
 :FLUELLEN  If I owe you anything, I will pay you in

 :trophy of predeceased valor, and dare not avouch in

 :News have I that my Doll is dead i' th' spital of a
S:malady of France, and there my rendezvous is quite

 :With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors
 :
 :To bring your most imperial Majesties
 :Unto this bar and royal interview,
 :Your Mightiness on both parts best can witness.
 :Since, then, my office hath so far prevailed
 :That face to face and royal eye to eye
S:
S:You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me
 :
 :If I demand before this royal view
 :
S:What rub or what impediment there is
 :
 :Why that the naked, poor, and mangled peace,
 :
 :Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,
 :
 :Should not in this best garden of the world,
 :Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
 :Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
 :And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
 :Corrupting in its own fertility.
 :Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
S:
 :Unpruned, dies. Her hedges, even-pleached,
 :
 :Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
 :
 :Put forth disordered twigs. Her fallow leas
 :
 :The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory
S:Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
 :
 :That should deracinate such savagery.
 :
S:The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
 :
 :The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,
 :
 :Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank,
 :
 :Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems
S:But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs,
 :
 :Losing both beauty and utility.
 :
 :And all our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,
 :
S:Defective in their natures, grow to wildness.
 :
 :Even so our houses and ourselves and children
 :
 :Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
 :
 :The sciences that should become our country,
 :But grow like savages, as soldiers will
S:That nothing do but meditate on blood,
 :
 :To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire,
 :
 :And everything that seems unnatural.
 :
 :Which to reduce into our former favor
 :You are assembled, and my speech entreats
 :That I may know the let why gentle peace
 :Should not expel these inconveniences
 :And bless us with her former qualities.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,
 :
 :Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections
 :
S:Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
 :
 :With full accord to all our just demands,
 :
 :Whose tenors and particular effects
 :
 :You have, enscheduled briefly, in your hands.
 :
 :BURGUNDY
S:The King hath heard them, to the which as yet
 :
 :There is no answer made.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Well then, the peace which you before so urged
 :Lies in his answer.
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :I have but with a cursitory eye
S:
 :O'erglanced the articles. Pleaseth your Grace
 :
S:To appoint some of your council presently
 :
 :To sit with us once more with better heed
 :
 :To resurvey them, we will suddenly
 :
 :Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Brother, we shall.--Go, uncle Exeter,
 :And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
S:Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King,
 :
 :And take with you free power to ratify,
 :
 :Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
 :
 :Shall see advantageable for our dignity,
 :Anything in or out of our demands,
 :And we'll consign thereto.--Will you, fair sister,
 :Go with the princes or stay here with us?
 :
 :QUEEN OF FRANCE
S:
 :Our gracious brother, I will go with them.
 :
 :Haply a woman's voice may do some good
 :
 :When articles too nicely urged be stood on.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
 :
 :She is our capital demand, comprised
 :Within the forerank of our articles.
 :
 :QUEEN OF FRANCE
 :She hath good leave.
 :[All but Katherine, and the King of England,
S:
 :and Alice exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Fair Katherine, and most fair,
 :
S:Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
 :
S:Such as will enter at a lady's ear
 :
 :And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE  Your Majesty shall mock at me. I cannot
 :
 :speak your England.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  O fair Katherine, if you will love me
 :
 :soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to
 :
 :hear you confess it brokenly with your English
 :tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
 :
S:KATHERINE  Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell wat is "like
 :
 :me."
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  An angel is like you, Kate, and you are
 :like an angel.
 :
 :KATHERINE, [to Alice]  Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable a
 :les anges?
 :
S:
 :ALICE  Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grace, ainsi dit-il.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not
 :
 :blush to affirm it.
 :
 :KATHERINE  O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont
 :pleines de tromperies.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY, [to Alice]  What says she, fair one? That the
 :
 :tongues of men are full of deceits?
 :
 :
 :
 :ALICE  Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
 :deceits; dat is de Princess.
 :
 :KING HENRY  The Princess is the better Englishwoman.--
S:I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy
 :
 :understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no
 :
S:better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst
 :
 :find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I
 :
 :had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways
 :
 :to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you."
 :Then if you urge me farther than to say "Do you, in
 :faith?" I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i'
 :faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say
 :you, lady?
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE  Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Marry, if you would put me to verses or
 :
 :to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me.
 :
 :For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and
 :for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a
 :reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a
 :lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with
 :my armor on my back, under the correction of
S:bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a
 :
 :wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my
 :
 :horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher
 :
 :and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God,
 :Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,
 :nor I have no cunning in protestation, only
 :downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor
 :never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of
S:this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning,
 :
 :that never looks in his glass for love of
 :
S:anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I
 :
 :speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for
 :
 :this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is
 :
 :true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee
 :too. And while thou liv'st, dear Kate, take a fellow of
 :plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must
 :do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in
 :other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,
 :that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they
S:
 :do always reason themselves out again. What? A
 :
 :speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a
 :
 :good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black
 :
 :beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,
 :a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but
 :a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or
 :rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright
 :and never changes but keeps his course truly. If
S:
 :thou would have such a one, take me. And take me,
 :
 :take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what
 :
 :say'st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and
 :
 :fairly, I pray thee.
 :
 :KATHERINE  Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of
 :France?
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, it is not possible you should love the
 :
 :enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you
 :
 :should love the friend of France, for I love France
 :so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will
 :have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine
S:and I am yours, then yours is France and you are
 :
 :mine.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  I cannot tell wat is dat.
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, Kate? I will tell thee in French,
 :which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a
 :new-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly
S:to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de
 :
 :France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi--let
 :
 :me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc
 :
 :votre est France, et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for
S:me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so
 :
 :much more French. I shall never move thee in
 :
 :French, unless it be to laugh at me.
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous
 :parlez, il est meilleur que l'anglais lequel je parle.
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, faith, is 't not, Kate, but thy speaking
S:of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must
 :
 :needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost
 :
 :thou understand thus much English? Canst thou
 :
 :love me?
 :
 :KATHERINE  I cannot tell.
 :
 :KING HENRY  Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I'll
 :ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at
S:
 :night, when you come into your closet, you'll question
 :
 :this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate,
 :
 :you will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you
 :
 :love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me
 :mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I
 :love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I
 :have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I
S:get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore
 :
 :needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou
 :
 :and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound
 :
 :a boy, half French, half English, that shall go
S:to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
 :
 :Shall we not? What say'st thou, my fair flower de
 :
S:luce?
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  I do not know dat.
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to
 :promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will
S:endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and
 :
 :for my English moiety, take the word of a king and
 :
 :a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine
 :
 :du monde, mon tres cher et divin deesse?
 :
 :KATHERINE  Your Majeste 'ave fausse French enough to
S:deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  Now fie upon my false French. By mine
 :
 :honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which
 :
 :honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood
 :
 :begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding
 :the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now
 :beshrew my father's ambition! He was thinking of
 :civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created
 :with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that
S:when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in
 :
S:faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.
 :
 :My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of
 :
 :beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou
 :
 :hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt
S:wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And
 :
 :therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have
 :
 :me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the
 :
S:thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,
 :
 :take me by the hand, and say "Harry of England, I
 :
 :am thine," which word thou shalt no sooner bless
 :
 :mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud "England
 :is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
 :Plantagenet is thine," who, though I speak it before
S:his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou
 :
 :shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your
 :
 :answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and
 :
 :thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,
 :break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt
 :thou have me?
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE  Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall
 :please him, Kate.
S:
 :
S:KATHERINE  Den it sall also content me.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you
 :
 :my queen.
 :
 :KATHERINE  Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma
 :foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur,
 :en baisant la main d' une--Notre Seigneur!--
 :indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon
S:
 :tres puissant seigneur.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
 :
 :
S:KATHERINE  Les dames et demoiselles, pour etre baisees
 :
 :devant leurs noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Madam my interpreter, what says she?
 :
S:ALICE  Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
 :
 :France--I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  To kiss.
 :
 :ALICE  Your Majeste entendre bettre que moi.
 :
 :KING HENRY  It is not a fashion for the maids in France
 :to kiss before they are married, would she say?
S:
 :
 :
 :ALICE  Oui, vraiment.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING HENRY  O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great
 :
 :kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined
 :
 :within the weak list of a country's fashion. We are
 :
 :the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that
 :follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults,
S:as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of
 :
 :your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore,
 :
 :patiently and yielding. [He kisses her.] You have
 :
 :witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence
 :in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues
 :of the French council, and they should sooner
 :persuade Harry of England than a general petition
 :of monarchs.
 :
S:
 :[Enter the French power, the French King and Queen
 :
 :and Burgundy, and the English Lords Westmoreland
 :
S:and Exeter.]
 :
 :Here comes your father.
 :
S:
 :
 :BURGUNDY  God save your Majesty. My royal cousin,
 :
 :teach you our princess English?
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  I would have her learn, my fair cousin,
 :how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
 :
 :BURGUNDY  Is she not apt?
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY  Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition
 :
 :is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice
 :
 :nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so
 :
 :conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will
 :appear in his true likeness.
 :
 :BURGUNDY  Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I
 :answer you for that. If you would conjure in her,
S:
 :you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in
 :
 :his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.
 :
 :Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet rosed
 :
 :over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny
 :the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked
 :seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a
 :maid to consign to.
 :
S:
 :KING HENRY  Yet they do wink and yield, as love is
 :
 :blind and enforces.
 :
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY  They are then excused, my lord, when they
 :see not what they do.
S:
 :
 :KING HENRY  Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to
 :
 :consent winking.
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY  I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if
 :you will teach her to know my meaning, for maids
S:well summered and warm kept are like flies at
 :
 :Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their
 :
 :eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
 :
 :before would not abide looking on.
 :
 :KING HENRY  This moral ties me over to time and a hot
S:summer. And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin,
 :
 :in the latter end, and she must be blind too.
 :
 :
 :
 :BURGUNDY  As love is, my lord, before it loves.
 :
 :KING HENRY  It is so. And you may, some of you, thank
S:love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair
 :
 :French city for one fair French maid that stands in
 :
 :my way.
 :
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE  Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively,
 :the cities turned into a maid, for they are all
S:girdled with maiden walls that war hath never
 :
 :entered.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Shall Kate be my wife?
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE  So please you.
 :
 :KING HENRY  I am content, so the maiden cities you
S:talk of may wait on her. So the maid that stood in
 :
 :the way for my wish shall show me the way to my
 :
 :will.
 :
 :
S:KING OF FRANCE
 :
 :We have consented to all terms of reason.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY  Is 't so, my lords of England?
 :
 :WESTMORELAND
S:The King hath granted every article,
 :
 :His daughter first, and, in sequel, all,
 :
 :According to their firm proposed natures.
 :
 :
 :EXETER
 :Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
 :Where your Majesty demands that the King of
 :France, having any occasion to write for matter of
 :grant, shall name your Highness in this form and
S:
 :with this addition, in French: Notre tres cher fils
 :
 :Henri, roi d' Angleterre, heritier de France; and thus
 :
 :in Latin: Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, rex
 :
 :Angliae et hoeres Franciae.
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :Nor this I have not, brother, so denied
 :But your request shall make me let it pass.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance,
 :
 :Let that one article rank with the rest,
 :And thereupon give me your daughter.
 :
 :KING OF FRANCE
 :Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
S:
 :Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms
 :
 :Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
 :
 :With envy of each other's happiness,
 :
 :May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
 :Plant neighborhood and Christian-like accord
 :In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
 :His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
 :
S:
 :LORDS  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :
 :Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all
 :That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
S:[He kisses her. Flourish.]
 :
 :
 :
S:QUEEN OF FRANCE
 :
 :God, the best maker of all marriages,
 :
 :Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.
 :
 :As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
 :So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
 :That never may ill office or fell jealousy,
 :Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
 :Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
S:To make divorce of their incorporate league,
 :
 :That English may as French, French Englishmen,
 :
 :Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
 :
 :
 :ALL  Amen.
 :
 :KING HENRY
 :Prepare we for our marriage; on which day,
 :My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
S:
 :And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
 :
S:Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,
 :
 :And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.
