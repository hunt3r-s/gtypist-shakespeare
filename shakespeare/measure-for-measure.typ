 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords, and Attendants.]
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE  Escalus.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  My lord.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Of government the properties to unfold
 :
 :Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,
 :Since I am put to know that your own science
 :Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
S:My strength can give you. Then no more remains
 :
 :But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
 :
 :And let them work. The nature of our people,
 :
 :Our city's institutions, and the terms
 :For common justice, you're as pregnant in
 :As art and practice hath enriched any
S:That we remember. There is our commission,
 :
 :[He hands Escalus a paper.]
 :
 :From which we would not have you warp.--Call
 :
 :hither,
S:I say, bid come before us Angelo.
 :
 :[An Attendant exits.]
 :
 :What figure of us think you he will bear?
 :
 :For you must know, we have with special soul
 :Elected him our absence to supply,
 :Lent him our terror, dressed him with our love,
 :And given his deputation all the organs
 :Of our own power. What think you of it?
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :
 :If any in Vienna be of worth
 :
 :To undergo such ample grace and honor,
 :It is Lord Angelo.
 :
 :[Enter Angelo.]
 :
S:
 :
S:DUKE  Look where he comes.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :Always obedient to your Grace's will,
S:I come to know your pleasure.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  Angelo,
 :
 :There is a kind of character in thy life
 :That to th' observer doth thy history
 :Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
 :Are not thine own so proper as to waste
 :Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
 :Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
S:
 :Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
 :
 :Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
 :
 :As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched
 :
 :But to fine issues, nor nature never lends
 :The smallest scruple of her excellence
S:But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
 :
 :Herself the glory of a creditor,
 :
 :Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
 :
 :To one that can my part in him advertise.
 :Hold, therefore, Angelo.
 :In our remove be thou at full ourself.
 :Mortality and mercy in Vienna
 :Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
 :Though first in question, is thy secondary.
S:
 :Take thy commission.	[He hands Angelo a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Now, good my lord,
 :
 :Let there be some more test made of my mettle
S:Before so noble and so great a figure
 :
 :Be stamped upon it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  No more evasion.
 :We have with a leavened and prepared choice
 :Proceeded to you. Therefore, take your honors.
 :Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
 :That it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned
 :Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
S:
 :As time and our concernings shall importune,
 :
 :How it goes with us, and do look to know
 :
 :What doth befall you here. So fare you well.
 :
 :To th' hopeful execution do I leave you
 :Of your commissions.
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Yet give leave, my lord,
 :
 :That we may bring you something on the way.
 :
 :
 :DUKE  My haste may not admit it.
 :Nor need you, on mine honor, have to do
 :With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,
 :So to enforce or qualify the laws
 :As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand.
S:
 :I'll privily away. I love the people,
 :
 :But do not like to stage me to their eyes.
 :
 :Though it do well, I do not relish well
 :
 :Their loud applause and aves vehement,
 :Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
 :That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
 :
 :ANGELO
S:
S:The heavens give safety to your purposes.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :
 :Lead forth and bring you back in happiness.
 :
 :
S:DUKE  I thank you. Fare you well.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS, [to Angelo]
 :
 :I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
 :
 :To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
 :
 :To look into the bottom of my place.
 :A power I have, but of what strength and nature
S:I am not yet instructed.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
 :And we may soon our satisfaction have
S:Touching that point.
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  I'll wait upon your Honor.

S:Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to
 :composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
 :the dukes fall upon the King.
 :
S:
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Heaven grant us its peace, but not
 :
 :the King of Hungary's!
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Amen.
 :
 :LUCIO  Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate
S:that went to sea with the ten commandments but
 :
 :scraped one out of the table.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  "Thou shalt not steal"?
 :
 :LUCIO  Ay, that he razed.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Why, 'twas a commandment to command
 :the Captain and all the rest from their functions!
S:
 :They put forth to steal. There's not a soldier of
 :
 :us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish
 :
 :the petition well that prays for peace.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  I never heard any soldier dislike it.
 :
S:LUCIO  I believe thee, for I think thou never wast where
 :
 :grace was said.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  No? A dozen times at least.
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN  What? In meter?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  In any proportion or in any language.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  I think, or in any religion.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
 :controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a
 :wicked villain, despite of all grace.
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN  Well, there went but a pair of shears
 :
 :between us.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  I grant, as there may between the lists and the
 :velvet. Thou art the list.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  And thou the velvet. Thou art good
 :velvet; thou 'rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I
 :had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled,
S:
 :as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
 :
 :feelingly now?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  I think thou dost, and indeed with most painful
 :feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own
 :confession, learn to begin thy health, but, whilst I
 :live, forget to drink after thee.
 :
S:
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  I think I have done myself wrong,
 :
S:have I not?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Yes, that thou hast, whether thou
 :
 :art tainted or free.
 :
 :[Enter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.]
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation
S:
 :comes! I have purchased as many diseases under
 :
 :her roof as come to--
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  To what, I pray?
 :
 :LUCIO  Judge.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  To three thousand dolors a year.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Ay, and more.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  A French crown more.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Thou art always figuring diseases in
 :me, but thou art full of error. I am sound.
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  Nay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound
 :
 :as things that are hollow. Thy bones are hollow.
 :
 :Impiety has made a feast of thee.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN, [to Bawd]  How now, which of your
 :hips has the most profound sciatica?
 :
 :BAWD  Well, well. There's one yonder arrested and
S:
 :carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Who's that, I pray thee?
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.
 :
S:
 :BAWD  Nay, but I know 'tis so. I saw him arrested, saw
 :
S:him carried away; and, which is more, within these
 :
 :three days his head to be chopped off.
 :
S:
 :
S:LUCIO  But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so!
 :
 :Art thou sure of this?
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam
 :Julietta with child.
 :
S:LUCIO  Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet
 :
 :me two hours since, and he was ever precise in
 :
 :promise-keeping.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Besides, you know, it draws something
 :near to the speech we had to such a purpose.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  But most of all agreeing with the
 :proclamation.
S:
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  Away. Let's go learn the truth of it.
 :
 :[Lucio and Gentlemen exit.]
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,
 :what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am
 :custom-shrunk.
 :
 :[Enter Pompey.]
S:
 :
 :
 :How now? What's the news with you?
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Yonder man is carried to prison.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Well, what has he done?
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  A woman.
 :
 :BAWD  But what's his offense?
 :
 :POMPEY  Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
S:
 :
 :
 :BAWD  What? Is there a maid with child by him?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  No, but there's a woman with maid by him.
 :You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?
 :
 :BAWD  What proclamation, man?
 :
S:
 :POMPEY  All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be
 :
 :plucked down.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAWD  And what shall become of those in the city?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  They shall stand for seed. They had gone down
 :
 :too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.
 :
S:BAWD  But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs
 :
 :be pulled down?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  To the ground, mistress.
 :
 :BAWD  Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
 :What shall become of me?
 :
 :POMPEY  Come, fear not you. Good counselors lack no
S:
 :clients. Though you change your place, you need
 :
S:not change your trade. I'll be your tapster still.
 :
S:Courage. There will be pity taken on you. You that
 :
 :have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
 :
 :will be considered.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet, and Officers.]
 :
 :
 :BAWD  What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's
 :withdraw.
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost
 :
 :to prison. And there's Madam Juliet.
 :
 :[Bawd and Pompey exit.]
 :
 :CLAUDIO, [to Provost]
 :Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
S:Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :
 :I do it not in evil disposition,
 :But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
 :
 :CLAUDIO
 :Thus can the demigod Authority
S:Make us pay down for our offense, by weight,
 :
 :The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
 :
 :On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Lucio and Second Gentleman.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO
 :Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this
 :restraint?
 :
 :CLAUDIO
S:
 :From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty.
 :
 :As surfeit is the father of much fast,
 :
 :So every scope by the immoderate use
 :
 :Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
 :Like rats that raven down their proper bane,
 :A thirsty evil, and when we drink, we die.
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I
 :
 :would send for certain of my creditors. And yet, to
 :
 :say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of
 :freedom as the mortality of imprisonment. What's
 :thy offense, Claudio?
 :
S:CLAUDIO
 :
 :What but to speak of would offend again.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  What, is 't murder?
 :
S:CLAUDIO  No.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  Lechery?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Call it so.
 :
 :
S:PROVOST  Away, sir. You must go.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO
 :
 :One word, good friend.--Lucio, a word with you.
 :
 :LUCIO  A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery
 :so looked after?
 :
 :CLAUDIO
S:
S:Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
 :
S:I got possession of Julietta's bed.
 :
 :You know the lady. She is fast my wife,
 :
S:Save that we do the denunciation lack
 :
 :Of outward order. This we came not to
 :
 :Only for propagation of a dower
 :
 :Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
 :From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
S:Till time had made them for us. But it chances
 :
 :The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
 :
 :With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO
 :With child, perhaps?
 :
S:CLAUDIO  Unhappily, even so.
 :
 :And the new deputy now for the Duke--
 :
 :Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
 :
S:Or whether that the body public be
 :
 :A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
 :
 :Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
 :
 :He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
 :Whether the tyranny be in his place
 :Or in his eminence that fills it up,
 :I stagger in--but this new governor
 :Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
 :Which have, like unscoured armor, hung by th' wall
S:
S:So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
 :
 :And none of them been worn; and for a name
 :
 :Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
 :
S:Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on
 :
 :thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may
 :sigh it off. Send after the Duke and appeal to him.
 :
 :CLAUDIO
 :I have done so, but he's not to be found.
 :I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
S:
 :This day my sister should the cloister enter
 :
S:And there receive her approbation.
 :
 :Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
 :
 :Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
 :
 :To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
 :I have great hope in that, for in her youth
S:There is a prone and speechless dialect
 :
 :Such as move men. Besides, she hath prosperous art
 :
 :When she will play with reason and discourse,
 :
 :And well she can persuade.
 :
 :LUCIO  I pray she may, as well for the encouragement of
 :the like, which else would stand under grievous
 :imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
 :would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
S:
 :game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  I thank you, good friend Lucio.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Within two hours.
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Come, officer, away.

 :
 :[Enter Duke and Friar Thomas.]
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :No, holy father, throw away that thought.
S:
S:Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
 :
 :Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
 :
 :To give me secret harbor hath a purpose
 :
 :More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
 :Of burning youth.
 :
 :FRIAR THOMAS  May your Grace speak of it?
 :
 :DUKE
S:
 :My holy sir, none better knows than you
 :
 :How I have ever loved the life removed,
 :
 :And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
 :
 :Where youth and cost witless bravery keeps.
 :I have delivered to Lord Angelo,
 :A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
 :My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
 :And he supposes me traveled to Poland,
S:
S:For so I have strewed it in the common ear,
 :
 :And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
 :
 :You will demand of me why I do this.
 :
S:
 :
 :FRIAR THOMAS  Gladly, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
 :
 :The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
 :
 :Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,
 :Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
 :That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
S:Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch
 :
 :Only to stick it in their children's sight
 :
S:For terror, not to use--in time the rod
 :
 :More mocked than feared--so our decrees,
 :
 :Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,
 :
 :And liberty plucks justice by the nose,
 :The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
 :Goes all decorum.
 :
 :FRIAR THOMAS  It rested in your Grace
 :To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased,
S:
 :And it in you more dreadful would have seemed
 :
S:Than in Lord Angelo.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  I do fear, too dreadful.
 :
 :Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
 :'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
 :For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done
 :When evil deeds have their permissive pass
 :And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my
 :father,
S:
 :I have on Angelo imposed the office,
 :
 :Who may in th' ambush of my name strike home,
 :
 :And yet my nature never in the fight
 :
 :To do in slander. And to behold his sway
 :I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
 :Visit both prince and people. Therefore I prithee
 :Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
 :How I may formally in person bear
S:
 :Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
 :
 :At our more leisure shall I render you.
 :
 :Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise,
 :
 :Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses
 :That his blood flows or that his appetite
 :Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
S:If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

S:
 :
 :
S:LUCIO
 :
 :Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
 :
 :Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Woe me, for what?
 :
 :LUCIO
 :For that which, if myself might be his judge,
 :He should receive his punishment in thanks:
S:
 :He hath got his friend with child.
 :
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :Sir, make me not your story.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  'Tis true.
 :I would not, though 'tis my familiar sin
 :With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
 :Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so.
 :I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
S:
 :By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
 :
 :And to be talked with in sincerity
 :
 :As with a saint.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
 :
S:LUCIO
 :
 :Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
 :
 :Your brother and his lover have embraced;
 :
 :As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
 :That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
 :To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
 :Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:
 :Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Is she your cousin?
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Adoptedly, as schoolmaids change their names
 :By vain though apt affection.
 :
S:
 :LUCIO  She it is.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :O, let him marry her!
 :
 :LUCIO  This is the point.
 :The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
 :Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
S:
 :In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
 :
 :By those that know the very nerves of state,
 :
 :His givings-out were of an infinite distance
 :
 :From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
 :And with full line of his authority,
 :Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
 :Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
 :The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
S:
 :But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
 :
 :With profits of the mind: study and fast.
 :
 :He--to give fear to use and liberty,
 :
 :Which have for long run by the hideous law
 :As mice by lions--hath picked out an act
 :Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
 :Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,
 :And follows close the rigor of the statute
S:
 :To make him an example. All hope is gone
 :
 :Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
 :
 :To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of business
 :
S:'Twixt you and your poor brother.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Doth he so
 :
 :Seek his life?
 :
S:LUCIO  Has censured him already,
 :
 :And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant
 :
 :For 's execution.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Alas, what poor ability's in me
 :To do him good?
 :
 :LUCIO  Assay the power you have.
S:
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :My power? Alas, I doubt--
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Our doubts are traitors
 :And makes us lose the good we oft might win
 :By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo
 :And let him learn to know, when maidens sue
 :Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
 :All their petitions are as freely theirs
S:
 :As they themselves would owe them.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  I'll see what I can do.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  But speedily!
 :
S:ISABELLA  I will about it straight,
 :
 :No longer staying but to give the Mother
 :
S:Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
 :
 :Commend me to my brother. Soon at night
 :
 :I'll send him certain word of my success.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO
 :I take my leave of you.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Good sir, adieu.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:ANGELO
 :
 :We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
 :
 :Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
 :
 :And let it keep one shape till custom make it
 :Their perch and not their terror.
 :
 :ESCALUS  Ay, but yet
 :Let us be keen and rather cut a little
 :Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
S:
 :Whom I would save had a most noble father.
 :
S:Let but your Honor know,
 :
 :Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
 :
 :That, in the working of your own affections,
 :
 :Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing,
 :Or that the resolute acting of your blood
 :Could have attained th' effect of your own purpose,
 :Whether you had not sometime in your life
 :Erred in this point which now you censure him,
 :And pulled the law upon you.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
S:'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
 :
 :Another thing to fall. I not deny
 :
 :The jury passing on the prisoner's life
 :
 :May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
 :Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to
 :justice,
 :That justice seizes. What knows the laws
 :That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
S:The jewel that we find, we stoop and take 't
 :
 :Because we see it; but what we do not see,
 :
S:We tread upon and never think of it.
 :
 :You may not so extenuate his offense
 :
 :For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
 :
 :When I that censure him do so offend,
 :Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
 :And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
 :
 :[Enter Provost.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :
 :Be it as your wisdom will.
 :
 :ANGELO  Where is the Provost?
S:
 :
 :PROVOST
 :
 :Here, if it like your Honor.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  See that Claudio
 :Be executed by nine tomorrow morning.
 :Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared,
 :For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
 :[Provost exits.]
S:
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :
 :Well, heaven forgive him and forgive us all.
 :
S:Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall.
 :
 :Some run from brakes of ice and answer none,
 :
 :And some condemned for a fault alone.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Elbow and Officers, with Froth
 :and Pompey.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Officers]  Come, bring them away. If these
 :
 :be good people in a commonweal that do nothing
 :but use their abuses in common houses, I know no
 :law. Bring them away.
 :
S:ANGELO  How now, sir, what's your name? And what's
 :
 :the matter?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  If it please your Honor, I am the poor duke's
 :constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon
S:justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
 :
 :Honor two notorious benefactors.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they?
 :Are they not malefactors?
 :
 :ELBOW  If it please your Honor, I know not well what
 :they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure
 :of, and void of all profanation in the world that
S:
 :good Christians ought to have.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Angelo]  This comes off well. Here's a wise
 :
 :officer.
 :
 :
S:ANGELO, [to Elbow]  Go to. What quality are they of?
 :
 :Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak,
 :
 :Elbow?
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  He cannot, sir. He's out at elbow.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  What are you, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel bawd; one that
 :serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they
S:say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she
 :
 :professes a hothouse, which I think is a very ill
 :
S:house too.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  How know you that?
 :
 :
S:ELBOW  My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and
 :
 :your Honor--
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  How? Thy wife?
 :
 :ELBOW  Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest
 :woman--
 :
S:ESCALUS  Dost thou detest her therefore?
 :
S:
 :
 :ELBOW  I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she
 :,
 :
 :that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity
 :
 :of her life, for it is a naughty house.
 :
 :ESCALUS  How dost thou know that, constable?
 :
S:ELBOW  Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a
 :
S:woman cardinally given, might have been accused
 :
 :in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness
 :
 :there.
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  By the woman's means?
 :
 :ELBOW  Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as
S:she spit in his face, so she defied him.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY, [to Escalus]  Sir, if it please your Honor, this is
 :
 :not so.
 :
 :ELBOW  Prove it before these varlets here, thou honorable
 :man, prove it.
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Angelo]  Do you hear how he misplaces?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, she came in great with child, and longing,
 :saving your Honor's reverence, for stewed prunes.
S:Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
 :
 :distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish
 :
 :of some threepence; your Honors have seen such
 :
 :dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good
 :dishes--
 :
 :ESCALUS  Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.
 :
 :POMPEY  No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
S:
 :the right. But to the point: as I say, this Mistress
 :
 :Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied,
 :
 :
 :and longing, as I said, for prunes; and
S:having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth
 :
 :here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said,
 :
 :and, as I say, paying for them very honestly--for, as
 :
 :you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence
 :again--
 :
 :FROTH  No, indeed.
 :
 :POMPEY  Very well. You being then, if you be remembered,
S:
 :cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes--
 :
 :
 :
 :FROTH  Ay, so I did indeed.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be
 :remembered, that such a one and such a one were
 :past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept
S:very good diet, as I told you--
 :
 :
 :
 :FROTH  All this is true.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Why, very well then--
 :
 :ESCALUS  Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose:
 :what was done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to
 :complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, your Honor cannot come to that yet.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  No, sir, nor I mean it not.
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, but you shall come to it, by your Honor's
 :leave. And I beseech you, look into Master Froth
 :here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year, whose
S:
 :father died at Hallowmas--was 't not at Hallowmas,
 :
 :Master Froth?
 :
 :
 :
S:FROTH  All-hallond Eve.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Why, very well. I hope here be truths.--He,
 :
 :sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir--[To Froth.]
S:'Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you
 :
S:have a delight to sit, have you not?
 :
 :
 :
 :FROTH  I have so, because it is an open room, and good
 :
S:for winter.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Why, very well then. I hope here be truths.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO, [to Escalus]
 :This will last out a night in Russia
 :When nights are longest there. I'll take my leave,
 :And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
 :Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
S:
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS
 :
 :I think no less. Good morrow to your Lordship
 :
S:[Angelo exits.]
 :
 :Now, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow's wife,
 :
 :once more?
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Once, sir? There was nothing done to her
 :
 :once.
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Escalus]  I beseech you, sir, ask him what
 :this man did to my wife.
 :
S:POMPEY, [to Escalus]  I beseech your Honor, ask me.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's
S:face.--Good Master Froth, look upon his Honor.
 :
S:'Tis for a good purpose.--Doth your Honor mark
 :
 :his face?
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Ay, sir, very well.
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Well, I do so.
 :
 :POMPEY  Doth your Honor see any harm in his face?
 :
 :ESCALUS  Why, no.
 :
S:
 :POMPEY  I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the
 :
 :worst thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the
 :
 :worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do
 :
 :the Constable's wife any harm? I would know that
 :of your Honor.
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  He's in the right, constable. What say you to
 :
 :it?
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  First, an it like you, the house is a respected
 :house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his
 :mistress is a respected woman.
 :
 :POMPEY  By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
S:
 :person than any of us all.
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The
 :
 :time is yet to come that she was ever respected with
 :man, woman, or child.
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, she was respected with him before he
 :
S:married with her.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity?
 :
 :Is this true?
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Pompey]  O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O
 :thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I
 :was married to her?--If ever I was respected with
 :her, or she with me, let not your Worship think me
S:
 :the poor duke's officer.--Prove this, thou wicked
 :
 :Hannibal, or I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have
 :
 :your action of slander too.
 :
S:
 :
 :ELBOW  Marry, I thank your good Worship for it. What
 :
 :is 't your Worship's pleasure I shall do with this
 :
 :wicked caitiff?
 :
 :ESCALUS  Truly, officer, because he hath some offenses
 :in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst,
 :let him continue in his courses till thou know'st
 :what they are.
S:
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Marry, I thank your Worship for it. [To Pompey.]
 :
 :Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what's
 :
S:come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou
 :
 :varlet, thou art to continue.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Froth]  Where were you born, friend?
S:
 :
S:FROTH  Here in Vienna, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
 :
 :
 :FROTH  Yes, an 't please you, sir.
 :
 :ESCALUS  So. [To Pompey.] What trade are you of, sir?
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  Your mistress' name?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Mistress Overdone.
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  Hath she had any more than one husband?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Nine, sir. Overdone by the last.
 :
 :ESCALUS  Nine?--Come hither to me, Master Froth.
 :Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
 :tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
S:will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
 :
 :more of you.
 :
 :
 :
 :FROTH  I thank your Worship. For mine own part, I
 :never come into any room in a taphouse but I am
 :drawn in.
 :
 :ESCALUS  Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell.
 :[Froth exits.]
S:
 :Come you hither to me, Master Tapster. What's your
 :
 :name, Master Tapster?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Pompey.
 :
 :ESCALUS  What else?
 :
 :POMPEY  Bum, sir.
S:
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing
 :
 :about you, so that in the beastliest sense you are
 :
 :Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd,
 :
 :Pompey, howsoever you color it in being a tapster,
S:are you not? Come, tell me true. It shall be the
 :
 :better for you.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
 :
 :ESCALUS  How would you live, Pompey? By being a
 :bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it
 :a lawful trade?
 :
S:
 :POMPEY  If the law would allow it, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it
 :
S:shall not be allowed in Vienna.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Does your Worship mean to geld and splay all
 :
 :the youth of the city?
 :
 :ESCALUS  No, Pompey.
 :
 :POMPEY  Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to 't
 :then. If your Worship will take order for the drabs
S:
 :and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell
 :
S:you. It is but heading and hanging.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  If you head and hang all that offend that way
 :
 :but for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
 :commission for more heads. If this law hold in
 :Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it after
 :threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to
 :pass, say Pompey told you so.
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  Thank you, good Pompey. And in requital of
 :
 :your prophecy, hark you: I advise you let me not
 :
 :find you before me again upon any complaint
S:whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I
 :
 :do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent and prove
 :
 :a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I
 :
 :shall have you whipped. So, for this time, Pompey,
 :fare you well.
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  I thank your Worship for your good counsel.
 :
 :[Aside.] But I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune
 :
 :shall better determine.
S:Whip me? No, no, let carman whip his jade.
 :
 :The valiant heart's not whipped out of his trade.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  Come hither to me, Master Elbow. Come
 :
 :hither, Master Constable. How long have you been
 :
S:in this place of constable?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Seven year and a half, sir.
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  I thought, by the readiness in the office, you
 :had continued in it some time. You say seven years
 :together?
 :
 :ELBOW  And a half, sir.
S:
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do
 :
 :you wrong to put you so oft upon 't. Are there not
 :
 :men in your ward sufficient to serve it?
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As
 :they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for
 :them. I do it for some piece of money and go
S:through with all.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Look you bring me in the names of some six
 :
S:or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.
 :
S:
 :
 :ELBOW  To your Worship's house, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  To my house. Fare you well.
 :[Elbow and Officers exit.]
 :[To Justice.] What's o'clock, think you?
 :
 :JUSTICE  Eleven, sir.
 :
S:
 :ESCALUS  I pray you home to dinner with me.
 :
 :
 :
 :JUSTICE  I humbly thank you.
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :It grieves me for the death of Claudio,
 :But there's no remedy.
 :
S:
 :JUSTICE
 :
S:Lord Angelo is severe.
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  It is but needful.
 :
 :Mercy is not itself that oft looks so.
 :
 :Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
 :
 :But yet, poor Claudio. There is no remedy.
S:Come, sir.

S:

 :PROVOST
 :
 :Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?

S:
 :Under your good correction, I have seen

S:What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?

S:If not already.

S:ISABELLA

 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]
 :Give 't not o'er so. To him again, entreat him,
S:Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown.
 :
 :You are too cold. If you should need a pin,
 :
 :You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
 :
S:To him, I say.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [to Angelo]
 :
 :Must he needs die?
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Maiden, no remedy.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,
 :And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :I will not do 't.
S:
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA  But can you if you would?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :Look what I will not, that I cannot do.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:But might you do 't and do the world no wrong
 :
 :If so your heart were touched with that remorse
 :
 :As mine is to him?
 :
 :
S:ANGELO  He's sentenced. 'Tis too late.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  You are too cold.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Too late? Why, no. I that do speak a word
 :May call it back again. Well believe this:
 :No ceremony that to great ones longs,
 :Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
S:
 :The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe
 :
S:Become them with one half so good a grace
 :
 :As mercy does.
 :
 :If he had been as you, and you as he,
 :
 :You would have slipped like him, but he like you
 :Would not have been so stern.
 :
S:ANGELO  Pray you begone.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :I would to heaven I had your potency,
 :And you were Isabel. Should it then be thus?
 :No. I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
 :And what a prisoner.
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  Ay, touch him; there's the
S:
S:vein.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
 :And you but waste your words.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA  Alas, alas!
 :
 :Why all the souls that were were forfeit once,
 :
 :And He that might the vantage best have took
 :Found out the remedy. How would you be
 :If He which is the top of judgment should
 :But judge you as you are? O, think on that,
 :And mercy then will breathe within your lips
 :Like man new-made.
S:
 :
 :
S:ANGELO  Be you content, fair maid.
 :
 :It is the law, not I, condemn your brother.
 :
 :Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
 :
 :It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Tomorrow? O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
 :He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
 :We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven
S:
 :With less respect than we do minister
 :
 :To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink
 :
 :you.
 :
S:Who is it that hath died for this offense?
 :
 :There's many have committed it.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  Ay, well said.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
 :Those many had not dared to do that evil
S:If the first that did th' edict infringe
 :
S:Had answered for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
 :
S:Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
 :
 :Looks in a glass that shows what future evils--
 :
S:Either now, or by remissness new-conceived,
 :
 :And so in progress to be hatched and born--
 :
 :Are now to have no successive degrees
 :
 :But, ere they live, to end.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Yet show some pity.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :I show it most of all when I show justice,
S:
 :For then I pity those I do not know,
 :
 :Which a dismissed offense would after gall,
 :
 :And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
 :
S:Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
 :
 :Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
 :
 :And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
 :
 :To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous
 :
 :To use it like a giant.
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  That's well said.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Could great men thunder
 :As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
S:
 :For every pelting, petty officer
 :
 :Would use his heaven for thunder,
 :
 :Nothing but thunder. Merciful heaven,
 :
 :Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
 :Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,
 :Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,
 :Dressed in a little brief authority,
 :Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
S:
 :His glassy essence, like an angry ape
 :
 :Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
 :
 :As makes the angels weep, who with our spleens
 :
S:Would all themselves laugh mortal.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]
 :
 :O, to him, to him, wench. He will relent.
 :He's coming. I perceive 't.
 :
 :PROVOST, [aside]  Pray heaven she win him.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:
 :We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
 :
S:Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
 :
 :But in the less, foul profanation.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]
 :Thou 'rt i' th' right, girl. More o' that.
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :That in the captain's but a choleric word
 :Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]
 :
 :Art avised o' that? More on 't.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :Why do you put these sayings upon me?
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:
 :Because authority, though it err like others,
 :
S:Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
 :
 :That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,
 :
 :Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
 :
 :That's like my brother's fault. If it confess
 :A natural guiltiness such as is his,
 :Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
S:Against my brother's life.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO, [aside]  She speaks, and 'tis such sense
 :
 :That my sense breeds with it.	[He begins to exit.]
 :Fare you well.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Gentle my lord, turn back.
S:
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Hark how I'll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.
 :
 :ANGELO  How? Bribe me?
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
S:Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  You had marred all else.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
 :Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
 :As fancy values them, but with true prayers
 :That shall be up at heaven and enter there
S:
 :Ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,
 :
 :From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
 :
 :To nothing temporal.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Well, come to me tomorrow.
 :
 :LUCIO, [aside to Isabella]  Go to, 'tis well; away.
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :Heaven keep your Honor safe.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO, [aside]  Amen.
 :For I am that way going to temptation
 :Where prayers cross.
 :
 :ISABELLA  At what hour tomorrow
S:
 :Shall I attend your Lordship?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  At any time 'fore noon.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Save your Honor.
 :[She exits, with Lucio and Provost.]
 :
 :ANGELO  From thee, even from thy virtue.
S:
 :What's this? What's this? Is this her fault or mine?
 :
 :The tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?
 :
 :Not she, nor doth she tempt; but it is I
 :
 :That, lying by the violet in the sun,
 :Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
 :Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
S:That modesty may more betray our sense
 :
 :Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground
 :
 :enough,
 :
 :Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
 :And pitch our evils there? O fie, fie, fie!
 :What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
 :Dost thou desire her foully for those things
 :That make her good? O, let her brother live.
 :Thieves for their robbery have authority
S:
 :When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her
 :
S:That I desire to hear her speak again
 :
 :And feast upon her eyes? What is 't I dream on?
 :
 :O cunning enemy that, to catch a saint,
 :
 :With saints dost bait thy hook. Most dangerous
 :Is that temptation that doth goad us on
S:To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet
 :
 :With all her double vigor, art and nature,
 :
 :Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid
 :
 :Subdues me quite. Ever till now
 :When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.

 :=======
S:[Enter Duke, disguised as a Friar, and Provost.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Hail to you, provost, so I think you are.
 :
S:PROVOST
 :
 :I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Bound by my charity and my blest order,
 :I come to visit the afflicted spirits
 :Here in the prison. Do me the common right
S:To let me see them, and to make me know
 :
S:The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
 :
 :To them accordingly.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
S:I would do more than that if more were needful.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Juliet.]
 :
 :
 :Look, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine,
 :Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
 :Hath blistered her report. She is with child,
 :And he that got it, sentenced--a young man,
 :More fit to do another such offense
S:
 :Than die for this.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :When must he die?
 :
 :PROVOST  As I do think, tomorrow.
 :[To Juliet.] I have provided for you. Stay awhile
 :And you shall be conducted.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, to Juliet]
 :
 :Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
 :
 :
 :JULIET
 :I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
S:
 :I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
 :
 :And try your penitence, if it be sound
 :
 :Or hollowly put on.
 :
 :
 :JULIET  I'll gladly learn.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Love you the man that wronged you?
 :
S:
 :JULIET
 :
 :Yes, as I love the woman that wronged him.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :So then it seems your most offenseful act
 :Was mutually committed?
 :
 :JULIET  Mutually.
S:
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIET
 :I do confess it and repent it, father.
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
 :
S:As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
 :
 :Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not
 :
 :heaven,
 :
 :Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
 :But as we stand in fear--
 :
 :JULIET
 :I do repent me as it is an evil,
S:And take the shame with joy.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  There rest.
 :
 :Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,
 :
 :And I am going with instruction to him.
 :
S:Grace go with you. Benedicite.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIET
 :
 :Must die tomorrow? O injurious love
 :That respites me a life, whose very comfort
S:Is still a dying horror.

S:Scene 4
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Angelo.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :When I would pray and think, I think and pray
 :To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
 :Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
S:
 :Anchors on Isabel. God in my mouth,
 :
 :As if I did but only chew His name,
 :
S:And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
 :
 :Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
 :
 :Is, like a good thing being often read,
 :
 :Grown sere and tedious. Yea, my gravity,
S:Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
 :
 :Could I with boot change for an idle plume
 :
 :Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
 :
 :How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
 :Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
S:To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
 :
 :Let's write "good angel" on the devil's horn.
 :
 :'Tis not the devil's crest. [Knock within.] How now,
 :
S:who's there?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
 :One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
 :
 :ANGELO
S:
 :Teach her the way. [Servant exits.] O heavens,
 :
 :Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
 :
 :Making both it unable for itself
 :
 :And dispossessing all my other parts
 :Of necessary fitness?
 :So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,
 :Come all to help him, and so stop the air
 :By which he should revive. And even so
S:
 :The general subject to a well-wished king
 :
 :Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
 :
 :Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
 :
 :Must needs appear offense.
 :
 :[Enter Isabella.]
 :
 :How now, fair maid?
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  I am come to know your pleasure.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANGELO
 :
 :That you might know it would much better please me
 :
S:Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
 :
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA  Even so. Heaven keep your Honor.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :Yet may he live a while. And it may be
 :As long as you or I. Yet he must die.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Under your sentence?
 :
S:ANGELO  Yea.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,
 :Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
 :That his soul sicken not.
 :
S:ANGELO
 :
S:Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
 :
 :To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
 :
 :A man already made, as to remit
 :
 :Their saucy sweetness that do coin God's image
S:In stamps that are forbid. 'Tis all as easy
 :
 :Falsely to take away a life true made
 :
 :As to put metal in restrained means
 :
 :To make a false one.
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in Earth.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly:
 :Which had you rather, that the most just law
 :Now took your brother's life, or, to redeem him,
S:Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
 :
 :As she that he hath stained?
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Sir, believe this:
 :I had rather give my body than my soul.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins
 :Stand more for number than for accompt.
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  How say you?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :Nay, I'll not warrant that, for I can speak
 :Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
S:I, now the voice of the recorded law,
 :
 :Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life.
 :
 :Might there not be a charity in sin
 :
 :To save this brother's life?
 :
 :ISABELLA  Please you to do 't,
 :I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
S:It is no sin at all, but charity.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANGELO
 :
 :Pleased you to do 't, at peril of your soul,
 :
 :Were equal poise of sin and charity.
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :That I do beg his life, if it be sin
 :
 :Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,
 :
 :If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
 :To have it added to the faults of mine
 :And nothing of your answer.
 :
 :ANGELO  Nay, but hear me.
 :Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are
S:
 :ignorant,
 :
 :Or seem so, crafty, and that's not good.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Let me be ignorant and in nothing good,
 :But graciously to know I am no better.
 :
 :ANGELO
S:
 :Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
 :
 :When it doth tax itself, as these black masks
 :
 :Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
 :
 :Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me.
 :To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
 :Your brother is to die.
 :
 :ISABELLA  So.
S:
S:
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :And his offense is so, as it appears,
 :
 :Accountant to the law upon that pain.
 :
S:ISABELLA  True.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :Admit no other way to save his life--
 :As I subscribe not that, nor any other--
 :But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
 :Finding yourself desired of such a person
 :Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
S:Could fetch your brother from the manacles
 :
 :Of the all-binding law, and that there were
 :
 :No earthly mean to save him but that either
 :
 :You must lay down the treasures of your body
 :To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,
 :What would you do?
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :As much for my poor brother as myself.
S:
 :That is, were I under the terms of death,
 :
 :Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies
 :
 :And strip myself to death as to a bed
 :
S:That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
 :
 :My body up to shame.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Then must your brother die.
 :
 :ISABELLA  And 'twere the cheaper way.
 :Better it were a brother died at once
 :Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
 :Should die forever.
S:
 :
 :
S:ANGELO
 :
 :Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
 :
 :That you have slandered so?
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
 :
 :Are of two houses. Lawful mercy
 :
 :Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,
 :And rather proved the sliding of your brother
 :A merriment than a vice.
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :O, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,
 :
 :To have what we would have, we speak not what we
 :mean.
 :I something do excuse the thing I hate
 :For his advantage that I dearly love.
 :
S:
 :ANGELO
 :
 :We are all frail.
 :
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA  Else let my brother die,
 :
S:If not a fedary but only he
 :
 :Owe and succeed thy weakness.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Nay, women are frail too.
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
S:Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
 :
 :Women--help, heaven--men their creation mar
 :
 :In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,
 :
 :For we are soft as our complexions are,
 :And credulous to false prints.
 :
 :ANGELO  I think it well.
 :And from this testimony of your own sex,
S:Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
 :
 :Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
 :
 :I do arrest your words. Be that you are--
 :
 :That is, a woman. If you be more, you're none.
 :If you be one, as you are well expressed
 :By all external warrants, show it now
 :By putting on the destined livery.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:
 :I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,
 :
 :Let me entreat you speak the former language.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Plainly conceive I love you.
 :
 :ISABELLA  My brother did love Juliet,
 :And you tell me that he shall die for 't.
 :
S:
 :ANGELO
 :
 :He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :I know your virtue hath a license in 't
 :Which seems a little fouler than it is
 :To pluck on others.
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Believe me, on mine honor,
 :
 :My words express my purpose.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Ha! Little honor to be much believed,
 :And most pernicious purpose. Seeming, seeming!
 :I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for 't.
S:Sign me a present pardon for my brother
 :
 :Or with an outstretched throat I'll tell the world
 :
 :aloud
 :
 :What man thou art.
 :
 :ANGELO  Who will believe thee, Isabel?
 :My unsoiled name, th' austereness of my life,
 :My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state
 :Will so your accusation overweigh
S:
 :That you shall stifle in your own report
 :
 :And smell of calumny. I have begun,
 :
 :And now I give my sensual race the rein.
 :
 :Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
 :Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
 :That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother
 :By yielding up thy body to my will,
S:Or else he must not only die the death,
 :
 :But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
 :
S:To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,
 :
 :Or by the affection that now guides me most,
 :
 :I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
 :
 :Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
 :[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
 :
 :Who would believe me? O, perilous mouths,
 :That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue,
 :Either of condemnation or approof,
 :Bidding the law make curtsy to their will,
 :Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
 :To follow as it draws. I'll to my brother.
S:
 :Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
 :
 :Yet hath he in him such a mind of honor
 :
 :That, had he twenty heads to tender down
 :
 :On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
 :Before his sister should her body stoop
 :To such abhorred pollution.
 :Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die.
 :More than our brother is our chastity.
S:
S:I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
 :
 :And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

 :
 :Be absolute for death. Either death or life

S:If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
 :
 :That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
 :
 :Servile to all the skyey influences
 :
 :That doth this habitation where thou keep'st
 :Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death's fool,
 :For him thou labor'st by thy flight to shun,
 :And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble,
 :For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
 :Are nursed by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means
S:
 :valiant,
 :
 :For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
 :
 :Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
 :
 :And that thou oft provok'st, yet grossly fear'st

 :For thou exists on many a thousand grains
 :That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,
 :For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
S:
 :And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain,
 :
 :For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
 :
 :After the moon. If thou art rich, thou 'rt poor,
 :
 :For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
 :Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
 :And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,
 :For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
S:The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
 :
 :Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum
 :
 :For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor
 :
 :age,
 :But as it were an after-dinner's sleep
 :Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth
 :Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
 :Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
 :Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty
S:
 :To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
 :
 :That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
 :
 :Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
 :
 :That makes these odds all even.
 :
 :CLAUDIO  I humbly thank you.
 :To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
 :And seeking death, find life. Let it come on.
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [within]
 :
 :What ho! Peace here, grace, and good company.
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :Who's there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, to Claudio]
S:
 :Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Most holy sir, I thank you.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Isabella.]
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA, [to Provost]
 :
 :My business is a word or two with Claudio.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
S:And very welcome.--Look, signior, here's your
 :
 :sister.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Provost, a word with you.
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  As many as you please.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, aside to Provost]
 :Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be
 :concealed.
 :[Duke and Provost exit.]
 :
S:CLAUDIO  Now, sister, what's the comfort?
 :
S:
 :
S:ISABELLA  Why,
 :
 :As all comforts are, most good, most good indeed.
 :
 :Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
 :
 :Intends you for his swift ambassador,
 :Where you shall be an everlasting leiger;
 :Therefore your best appointment make with speed.
 :Tomorrow you set on.
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Is there no remedy?
S:
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :None but such remedy as, to save a head,
 :
 :To cleave a heart in twain.
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  But is there any?
 :
 :ISABELLA  Yes, brother, you may live.
 :There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
 :If you'll implore it, that will free your life
S:
 :But fetter you till death.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Perpetual durance?
 :
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
 :
S:Though all the world's vastidity you had,
 :
 :To a determined scope.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  But in what nature?
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :In such a one as, you consenting to 't,
S:Would bark your honor from that trunk you bear
 :
 :And leave you naked.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Let me know the point.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake
 :
 :Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
 :
 :And six or seven winters more respect
 :
 :Than a perpetual honor. Dar'st thou die?
 :The sense of death is most in apprehension,
S:And the poor beetle that we tread upon
 :
 :In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
 :
S:As when a giant dies.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Why give you me this shame?
 :
 :Think you I can a resolution fetch
 :From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
 :I will encounter darkness as a bride,
 :And hug it in mine arms.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :There spake my brother! There my father's grave
 :
S:Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.
 :
 :Thou art too noble to conserve a life
 :
 :In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy--
 :
 :Whose settled visage and deliberate word
 :Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
S:As falcon doth the fowl--is yet a devil.
 :
 :His filth within being cast, he would appear
 :
 :A pond as deep as hell.
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  The prenzie Angelo?
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
 :The damned'st body to invest and cover
S:
 :In prenzie guards. Dost thou think, Claudio,
 :
 :If I would yield him my virginity
 :
 :Thou mightst be freed?
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  O heavens, it cannot be!
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Yes, he would give 't thee; from this rank offense,
S:
 :So to offend him still. This night's the time
 :
 :That I should do what I abhor to name,
 :
 :Or else thou diest tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Thou shalt not do 't.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA  O, were it but my life,
 :
 :I'd throw it down for your deliverance
 :
 :As frankly as a pin.
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Thanks, dear Isabel.
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Yes. Has he affections in him
 :
 :That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose,
 :
S:When he would force it? Sure it is no sin,
 :
 :Or of the deadly seven it is the least.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Which is the least?
 :
 :CLAUDIO
 :If it were damnable, he being so wise,
 :Why would he for the momentary trick
 :Be perdurably fined? O, Isabel--
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :What says my brother?
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Death is a fearful thing.
 :
 :ISABELLA  And shamed life a hateful.
 :
S:
 :CLAUDIO
 :
 :Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,
 :
 :To lie in cold obstruction and to rot,
 :
 :This sensible warm motion to become
 :A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
 :To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
 :In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice,
 :To be imprisoned in the viewless winds
S:
 :And blown with restless violence round about
 :
 :The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
 :
 :Of those that lawless and incertain thought
 :
 :Imagine howling--'tis too horrible.
 :The weariest and most loathed worldly life
 :That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment
 :Can lay on nature is a paradise
 :To what we fear of death.
S:
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Alas, alas!
 :
 :
 :
S:CLAUDIO  Sweet sister, let me live.
 :
 :What sin you do to save a brother's life,
 :
 :Nature dispenses with the deed so far
 :
 :That it becomes a virtue.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA  O, you beast!
 :
 :O faithless coward, O dishonest wretch,
 :
 :Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
 :Is 't not a kind of incest to take life
 :From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
 :Heaven shield my mother played my father fair,
 :For such a warped slip of wilderness
S:Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance;
 :
 :Die, perish. Might but my bending down
 :
S:Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
 :
 :I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
 :
 :No word to save thee.
 :
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Nay, hear me, Isabel--
 :
S:ISABELLA  O, fie, fie, fie!
 :
 :Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
 :
 :Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd.
 :
 :'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
 :
S:CLAUDIO  O, hear me, Isabella--
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Duke as a Friar.]
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar, to Isabella]
 :
 :Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
 :
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA  What is your will?
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Might you dispense with your leisure, I
 :
 :would by and by have some speech with you. The
 :
 :satisfaction I would require is likewise your own
 :benefit.
 :
S:ISABELLA  I have no superfluous leisure. My stay must
 :
 :be stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you
 :
 :awhile.
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, taking Claudio aside]  Son, I have overhear
 :d
 :what hath passed between you and your
 :sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;
 :only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practice
S:
 :his judgment with the disposition of natures. She,
 :
 :having the truth of honor in her, hath made him
 :
 :that gracious denial which he is most glad to
 :
 :receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this
S:to be true. Therefore prepare yourself to death. Do
 :
 :not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are
 :
 :fallible. Tomorrow you must die. Go to your knees
 :
 :and make ready.
S:
 :
 :CLAUDIO  Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of
 :
 :love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  Hold you there. Farewell.--Provost, a
 :
 :word with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Provost.]
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  What's your will, father?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  That now you are come, you will be
S:
 :gone. Leave me awhile with the maid. My mind
 :
S:promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by
 :
 :my company.
 :
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  In good time.	[He exits, with Claudio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, to Isabella]  The hand that hath made
S:you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is
 :
 :cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness,
 :
 :but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall
 :
 :keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo
S:hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my
 :
 :understanding; and but that frailty hath examples
 :
 :for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will
 :
 :you do to content this substitute and to save your
 :brother?
 :
 :ISABELLA  I am now going to resolve him. I had rather
 :my brother die by the law than my son should be
 :unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good
S:
 :duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I
 :
S:can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
 :
 :discover his government.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as
 :
 :the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation:
 :
 :he made trial of you only. Therefore, fasten
S:your ear on my advisings. To the love I have in doing
 :
 :good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself
 :
 :believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor
 :
 :wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother
S:from the angry law, do no stain to your own
 :
 :gracious person, and much please the absent duke,
 :
 :if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing
 :
 :of this business.
 :
 :ISABELLA  Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to
 :do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my
 :spirit.
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Virtue is bold, and goodness never
 :
 :fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the
 :
 :sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried
 :
 :at sea?
 :
 :ISABELLA  I have heard of the lady, and good words
S:went with her name.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  She should this Angelo have married,
 :
 :was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed.
 :Between which time of the contract and
S:limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was
 :
 :wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the
 :
 :dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell
 :
 :to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble
 :and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever
 :most kind and natural; with him, the portion and
S:sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with
 :
 :both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming
 :
 :Angelo.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  Left her in her tears and dried not one
 :
 :of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows
 :
 :whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in
 :
 :few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which
 :she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her
 :tears, is washed with them but relents not.
 :
 :ISABELLA  What a merit were it in death to take this
S:poor maid from the world! What corruption in this
 :
 :life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this
 :
 :can she avail?
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  It is a rupture that you may easily heal,
 :and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but
 :keeps you from dishonor in doing it.
 :
S:ISABELLA  Show me how, good father.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  This forenamed maid hath yet in her
 :
 :the continuance of her first affection. His unjust
S:unkindness, that in all reason should have
 :
 :quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the
 :
S:current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to
 :
 :Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience,
 :
S:agree with his demands to the point. Only
 :
 :refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay
 :
 :with him may not be long, that the time may have all
 :
 :shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to
S:convenience. This being granted in course, and
 :
 :now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid
 :
 :to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If
 :
 :the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
S:compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is
 :
 :your brother saved, your honor untainted, the poor
 :
 :Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy
 :
 :scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his
S:attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may,
 :
 :the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit
 :
 :from reproof. What think you of it?
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  The image of it gives me content already, and
 :I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  It lies much in your holding up. Haste
 :you speedily to Angelo. If for this night he entreat
S:
 :you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I
 :
 :will presently to Saint Luke's. There at the moated
 :
 :grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that place
 :
S:call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo that it may
 :
 :be quickly.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well,
 :good father.
S:[She exits. The Duke remains.]

 :Scene 2
 :
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Elbow, Pompey, and Officers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Nay, if there be no remedy for it
 :but that you will needs buy and sell men and
 :women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink
S:brown and white bastard.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, aside]  O heavens, what stuff is here?
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries,
 :the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed
 :by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm,
 :and furred with fox and lambskins too, to signify
 :that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for
S:
 :the facing.
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Come your way, sir.--Bless you, good father
 :
 :friar.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  And you, good brother father. What
S:offense hath this man made you, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir,
 :
 :we take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found
 :upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
 :sent to the Deputy.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, to Pompey]
 :
 :Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
 :
 :The evil that thou causest to be done,
 :That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
 :What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
S:From such a filthy vice; say to thyself,
 :
 :From their abominable and beastly touches
 :
S:I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
 :
 :Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
 :
 :So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet,
 :sir, I would prove--
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
S:
 :Thou wilt prove his.--Take him to prison, officer.
 :
 :Correction and instruction must both work
 :
 :Ere this rude beast will profit.
 :
S:
 :
 :ELBOW  He must before the Deputy, sir; he has given
 :
 :him warning. The Deputy cannot abide a whoremaster.
 :
 :If he be a whoremonger and comes before
S:him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :That we were all, as some would seem to be,
 :From our faults, as faults from seeming, free.
 :
 :ELBOW  His neck will come to your waist--a cord, sir.
 :
S:[Enter Lucio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  I spy comfort, I cry bail. Here's a gentleman
S:and a friend of mine.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of
 :
 :Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there
S:none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman,
 :
 :to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket
 :
 :and extracting it clutched? What reply, ha? What
 :
S:sayst thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is 't not
 :
 :drowned i' th' last rain, ha? What sayst thou, trot? Is
 :
 :the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad
 :
 :and few words? Or how? The trick of it?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, aside]  Still thus, and thus; still worse.
 :
 :LUCIO, [to Pompey]  How doth my dear morsel, thy
 :mistress? Procures she still, ha?
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and
 :
 :she is herself in the tub.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Why, 'tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so.
S:
 :
 :Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd, an
 :
 :unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going to
 :
 :prison, Pompey?
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  Yes, faith, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go say I
S:sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be
 :the due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he,
 :doubtless, and of antiquity too. Bawd born.--
 :Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
 :Pompey. You will turn good husband now,
S:
 :Pompey; you will keep the house.
 :
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  I hope, sir, your good Worship will be my bail.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the
 :wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage.
 :If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is
S:the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.--Bless you, friar.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  And you.
 :
 :
S:LUCIO, [to Pompey]  Does Bridget paint still, Pompey,
 :
 :ha?
 :
 :
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Come your ways, sir, come.
 :
 :POMPEY, [to Lucio]  You will not bail me, then, sir?
 :
 :LUCIO  Then, Pompey, nor now.--What news abroad,
 :friar? What news?
S:
 :
 :
 :ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Come your ways, sir, come.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
 :[Elbow, Pompey, and Officers exit.]
 :What news, friar, of the Duke?
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  I know none. Can you tell me of any?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;
 :other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think
S:you?
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  I know not where, but wheresoever, I
 :
 :wish him well.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal
 :from the state and usurp the beggary he was never
 :born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence.
 :He puts transgression to 't.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  He does well in 't.
S:
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm
 :
 :in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  It is too general a vice, and severity
S:must cure it.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
 :
S:it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirp it quite,
 :
S:friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say
 :
 :this Angelo was not made by man and woman after
 :
 :this downright way of creation. Is it true, think
 :
 :you?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  How should he be made, then?
 :
 :LUCIO  Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some,
S:that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is
 :
 :certain that when he makes water, his urine is
 :
S:congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a
 :
 :motion generative, that's infallible.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
S:
 :
S:LUCIO  Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
 :
 :rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
 :
 :man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
 :
 :Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting
 :a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the
 :nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the
 :sport, he knew the service, and that instructed him
 :to mercy.
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  I never heard the absent duke much
 :
 :detected for women. He was not inclined that way.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  O, sir, you are deceived.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  'Tis not possible.
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty;
 :
 :and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The
 :
 :Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too,
 :that let me inform you.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  You do him wrong, surely.
 :
S:LUCIO  Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
 :
 :Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his
 :
S:withdrawing.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  What, I prithee, might be the cause?
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  No, pardon. 'Tis a secret must be locked within
S:the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you
 :
 :understand: the greater file of the subject held the
 :
 :Duke to be wise.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Wise? Why, no question but he was.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Either this is envy in you, folly, or
 :
 :mistaking. The very stream of his life and the
 :
S:business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted
 :
 :need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be
 :
 :but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he
 :
 :shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman,
 :and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully. Or,
 :if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in
 :your malice.
 :
 :LUCIO  Sir, I know him, and I love him.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Love talks with better knowledge, and
 :
 :knowledge with dearer love.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Come, sir, I know what I know.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  I can hardly believe that, since you
 :know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke
S:
S:return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you
 :
 :to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
 :
 :have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am
 :
 :bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?
 :
 :LUCIO  Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  He shall know you better, sir, if I may
S:live to report you.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  I fear you not.
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  O, you hope the Duke will return no
 :more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.
 :But indeed I can do you little harm; you'll
 :forswear this again.
 :
S:
 :LUCIO  I'll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me,
 :
S:friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio
 :
 :die tomorrow or no?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Why should he die, sir?
 :
 :LUCIO  Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
 :the Duke we talk of were returned again. This
 :ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
S:continency. Sparrows must not build in his house
 :
 :eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet
 :
 :would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would
 :
S:never bring them to light Would he were returned.
 :
 :Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
 :
 :Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The
 :
S:Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
 :
 :Fridays. He's now past it, yet--and I say to thee--
 :
 :he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt
 :
 :brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :DUKE
 :No might nor greatness in mortality
 :Can censure scape. Back-wounding calumny
S:
 :The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
 :
 :Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
 :
 :But who comes here?
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Escalus, Provost, Officers, and Mistress
 :
 :Overdone, a Bawd.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Officers]  Go, away with her to prison.
 :
 :BAWD  Good my lord, be good to me. Your Honor is
 :accounted a merciful man, good my lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit
 :
 :in the same kind? This would make mercy
 :
 :swear and play the tyrant.
 :
S:PROVOST  A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it
 :
 :please your Honor.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD, [to Escalus]  My lord, this is one Lucio's information
 :
 :against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was
 :with child by him in the Duke's time; he promised
 :her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
 :come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself, and see
S:
 :how he goes about to abuse me.
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let
 :
 :him be called before us. Away with her to prison.--
 :
 :Go to, no more words.	[Officers exit with Bawd.]
 :
S:Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered.
 :
S:Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished
 :
 :with divines and have all charitable preparation. If
 :
 :my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so
 :
 :with him.
 :
 :PROVOST  So please you, this friar hath been with him,
S:and advised him for th' entertainment of death.
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  Good even, good father.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Bliss and goodness on you.
 :
S:
 :
S:ESCALUS  Of whence are you?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Not of this country, though my chance is now
S:To use it for my time. I am a brother
 :
 :Of gracious order, late come from the See
 :
 :In special business from his Holiness.
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  What news abroad i' th' world?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  None but that there is so great a fever
 :
 :on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it.
 :Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to
 :be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be
 :constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth
S:enough alive to make societies secure, but security
 :
 :enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon
 :
 :this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news
 :
 :is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I pray you,
 :sir, of what disposition was the Duke?
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  One that, above all other strifes, contended
 :
 :especially to know himself.
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  What pleasure was he given to?
 :
S:ESCALUS  Rather rejoicing to see another merry than
 :
 :merry at anything which professed to make him
 :
 :rejoice--a gentleman of all temperance. But leave
 :
 :we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove
 :prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find
 :Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that
S:you have lent him visitation.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  He professes to have received no
 :
 :sinister measure from his judge but most willingly
 :
 :humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet
 :
 :had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
 :frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by
 :my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now
 :is he resolved to die.
 :
 :ESCALUS  You have paid the heavens your function and
S:
 :the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
 :
 :labored for the poor gentleman to the extremest
 :
 :shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I
 :
 :found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
 :he is indeed Justice.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  If his own life answer the straitness of
 :his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if
S:
 :he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Peace be with you.
S:[Escalus and Provost exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
S:He who the sword of heaven will bear
 :
 :Should be as holy as severe,
 :
 :Pattern in himself to know,
 :
 :Grace to stand, and virtue go;
S:More nor less to others paying
 :
 :Than by self-offenses weighing.
 :
 :Shame to him whose cruel striking
 :
 :Kills for faults of his own liking.
S:Twice treble shame on Angelo,
 :
 :To weed my vice, and let his grow.
 :
 :O, what may man within him hide,
 :
 :Though angel on the outward side!
 :How may likeness made in crimes,
 :Making practice on the times,
S:To draw with idle spiders' strings
 :
 :Most ponderous and substantial things.
 :
 :Craft against vice I must apply.
 :
S:With Angelo tonight shall lie
 :
S:His old betrothed but despised.
 :
 :So disguise shall, by th' disguised,

S:Pay with falsehood false exacting
 :
 :And perform an old contracting.

 :
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  You have not been inquired after. I have sat

S:

 :[Enter Isabella.]

S:DUKE, [as Friar]  I do constantly believe you. The time is

 :
 :MARIANA  I am always bound to you.	[She exits.]
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Very well met, and welcome.
 :
 :What is the news from this good deputy?
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :He hath a garden circummured with brick,
S:Whose western side is with a vineyard backed;
 :
 :And to that vineyard is a planched gate
 :
 :That makes his opening with this bigger key.
 :
 :This other doth command a little door

 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
S:
 :But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :I have ta'en a due and wary note upon 't.
 :With whispering and most guilty diligence,
S:In action all of precept, he did show me
 :
 :The way twice o'er.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Are there no other tokens
 :Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark,
 :And that I have possessed him my most stay
S:
 :Can be but brief, for I have made him know
 :
S:I have a servant comes with me along
 :
 :That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
 :
 :I come about my brother.
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  'Tis well borne up.
 :
 :I have not yet made known to Mariana
 :
 :A word of this.--What ho, within; come forth.

 :[To Mariana.] I pray you be acquainted with this

S:She comes to do you good.

 :Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
S:

 :Take then this your companion by the hand,
 :
 :Who hath a story ready for your ear.
 :I shall attend your leisure. But make haste.
 :The vaporous night approaches.
 :
 :MARIANA, [to Isabella]  Will 't please you walk aside?
S:
 :[Isabella and Mariana exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :O place and greatness, millions of false eyes
 :
 :Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report
 :Run with these false, and, most contrarious, quest
 :Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit
 :Make thee the father of their idle dream
 :And rack thee in their fancies.

S:DUKE, [as Friar]  Welcome. How agreed?

 :Scene 2
 :=======
S:[Enter Provost, Pompey, and Officer.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's
 :head?
 :
 :POMPEY  If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be
S:a married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
 :
 :cut off a woman's head.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield
 :me a direct answer. Tomorrow morning are to die
 :Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a
 :common executioner, who in his office lacks a
 :helper. If you will take it on you to assist him, it
 :shall redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall
S:
 :have your full time of imprisonment and your
 :
 :deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for you have
 :
 :been a notorious bawd.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of
 :mind, but yet I will be content to be a lawful
 :hangman. I would be glad to receive some instruction
 :from my fellow partner.
S:
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  What ho, Abhorson!--Where's Abhorson
 :
 :there?
 :
 :
S:[Enter Abhorson.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ABHORSON  Do you call, sir?
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you tomorrow
 :
S:in your execution. If you think it meet, compound
 :
 :with him by the year and let him abide here
 :
 :with you; if not, use him for the present and dismiss
 :
 :him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he
 :hath been a bawd.
 :
 :ABHORSON  A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit
 :our mystery.
 :
S:
 :PROVOST  Go to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will
 :
 :turn the scale.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Pray, sir, by your good favor--for surely, sir, a
 :good favor you have, but that you have a hanging
 :look--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
 :
 :ABHORSON  Ay, sir, a mystery.
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery;
 :
 :and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
 :
S:using painting, do prove my occupation a
 :
 :mystery; but what mystery there should be in hanging,
 :
 :if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
 :
 :
 :ABHORSON  Sir, it is a mystery.
 :
 :POMPEY  Proof?
 :
 :ABHORSON  Every true man's apparel fits your thief. If it
S:
S:be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
 :
 :big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief
 :
 :thinks it little enough. So every true man's apparel
 :
 :fits your thief.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Provost.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Are you agreed?
 :
 :POMPEY  Sir, I will serve him, for I do find your hangman
 :is a more penitent trade than your bawd. He
 :doth oftener ask forgiveness.
S:
S:
 :
 :PROVOST, [to Abhorson]  You, sirrah, provide your block
 :
 :and your axe tomorrow, four o'clock.
 :
 :
 :ABHORSON, [to Pompey]  Come on, bawd. I will instruct
 :thee in my trade. Follow.
 :
 :POMPEY  I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have
S:occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
 :
 :me yare. For truly, sir, for your kindness, I owe
 :
 :you a good turn.	[Pompey and Abhorson exit.]
 :
 :
S:PROVOST, [to Officer]
 :
 :Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.
 :
 :[Officer exits.]
 :
 :Th' one has my pity; not a jot the other,
S:Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Claudio, with Officer.]
 :
 :
 :Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death.
 :'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow
 :Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
 :
 :CLAUDIO
S:
 :As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labor
 :
 :When it lies starkly in the traveler's bones.
 :
 :He will not wake.
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Who can do good on him?
 :Well, go, prepare yourself. [Knock within.] But hark,
 :what noise?--
S:Heaven give your spirits comfort. [Claudio exits,
 :
 :with Officer.] [Knock within.] By and by!--
 :
 :I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
 :
 :For the most gentle Claudio.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Duke, as a Friar.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Welcome, father.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
 :
 :Envelop you, good provost. Who called here of late?
 :
 :PROVOST
 :None since the curfew rung.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Not Isabel?
S:
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  No.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  They will, then, ere 't be long.
 :
 :PROVOST  What comfort is for Claudio?
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :There's some in hope.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  It is a bitter deputy.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Not so, not so. His life is paralleled
 :
 :Even with the stroke and line of his great justice.
 :He doth with holy abstinence subdue
 :That in himself which he spurs on his power
S:To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that
 :
 :Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous,
 :
S:But this being so, he's just. [Knock within.] Now are
 :
 :they come.	[Provost exits.]
 :
 :This is a gentle provost. Seldom when
 :
 :The steeled jailer is the friend of men.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Provost. Knocking continues.]
 :
 :
 :
 :How now, what noise? That spirit's possessed with
 :haste
S:That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :
 :There he must stay until the officer
 :Arise to let him in. He is called up.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
S:But he must die tomorrow?
 :
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  None, sir, none.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
 :
 :You shall hear more ere morning.
 :
 :PROVOST  Happily
 :You something know, yet I believe there comes
 :No countermand. No such example have we.
 :Besides, upon the very siege of justice
S:
 :Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
 :
 :Professed the contrary.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :This is his Lordship's man.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  And here comes Claudio's pardon.
S:
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER, [giving Provost a paper]  My lord hath sent
 :
 :you this note, and by me this further charge: that
 :
 :you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
 :neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.
 :Good morrow, for, as I take it, it is almost day.
 :
 :PROVOST  I shall obey him.	[Provost reads message.]
S:
 :[Messenger exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [aside]
 :
 :This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
 :For which the pardoner himself is in.
 :Hence hath offense his quick celerity
 :When it is borne in high authority.
 :When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
S:
 :That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
 :
 :[As Friar.] Now, sir, what news?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me
 :remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
 :putting-on, methinks strangely; for he hath
 :not used it before.
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Pray you let's hear.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST, [reads the letter.]
 :
 :Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio
 :be executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon
 :Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have
 :Claudio's head sent me by five. Let this be duly
 :performed with a thought that more depends on it
S:
 :than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your
 :
 :office, as you will answer it at your peril.
 :
 :What say you to this, sir?
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  What is that Barnardine who is to be
 :executed in th' afternoon?
 :
S:PROVOST  A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and
 :
 :bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  How came it that the absent duke had
 :
 :not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed
 :
 :him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
 :
 :PROVOST  His friends still wrought reprieves for him;
 :and indeed his fact, till now in the government of
 :Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  It is now apparent?
 :
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Hath he borne himself penitently in
 :prison? How seems he to be touched?
 :
 :PROVOST  A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully
 :but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and
 :fearless of what's past, present, or to come; insensible
S:
 :of mortality and desperately mortal.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  He wants advice.
 :
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  He will hear none. He hath evermore had the
 :
 :liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape
 :
 :hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not
 :many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked
 :him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed
 :him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not moved him
 :at all.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  More of him anon. There is written in
 :
 :your brow, provost, honesty and constancy; if I read
 :
 :it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the
 :boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
 :Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
 :no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo, who hath
S:sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
 :
 :manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite, for
 :
 :the which you are to do me both a present and a
 :
S:dangerous courtesy.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Pray, sir, in what?
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  In the delaying death.
 :
 :PROVOST  Alack, how may I do it, having the hour
 :limited, and an express command, under penalty,
 :to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may
S:
 :make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
 :
 :smallest.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  By the vow of mine order I warrant
 :you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this
 :Barnardine be this morning executed and his head
S:borne to Angelo.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Angelo hath seen them both and will discover
 :
 :the favor.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  O, death's a great disguiser, and you
 :may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and
 :say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared
 :before his death. You know the course is common.
S:
 :If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks
 :
 :and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I
 :
 :will plead against it with my life.
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Were you sworn to the Duke or to the
 :Deputy?
S:
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  To him and to his substitutes.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  You will think you have made no
 :offense if the Duke avouch the justice of your
 :dealing?
 :
 :PROVOST  But what likelihood is in that?
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet
 :
S:since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity,
 :
 :nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will
 :
 :go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of
 :
S:you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
 :
 :Duke. [He shows the Provost a paper.] You know the
 :
 :character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange
 :
 :to you.
 :
 :PROVOST  I know them both.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  The contents of this is the return of the
 :Duke; you shall anon overread it at your pleasure,
S:
S:where you shall find within these two days he will
 :
S:be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for
 :
 :he this very day receives letters of strange tenor,
 :
 :perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering
 :
 :into some monastery, but by chance nothing of
 :what is writ. Look, th' unfolding star calls up the
S:shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how
 :
 :these things should be. All difficulties are but easy
 :
 :when they are known. Call your executioner, and
 :
 :off with Barnardine's head. I will give him a present
 :shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are
 :amazed, but this shall absolutely resolve you.
S:[He gives the Provost the paper.]
 :
 :Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

 :POMPEY  I am as well acquainted here as I was in our
 :house of profession. One would think it were Mistress
 :Overdone's own house, for here be many of
S:her old customers. First, here's young Master Rash.
 :
 :He's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
 :
 :ginger, ninescore and seventeen pounds, of which
 :
 :he made five marks ready money. Marry, then
S:ginger was not much in request, for the old women
 :
 :were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper,
 :
S:at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some
 :
 :four suits of peach-colored satin, which now
 :
 :peaches him a beggar. Then have we here young
 :
 :Dizzy and young Master Deep-vow, and Master
 :Copper-spur and Master Starve-lackey the rapier-and-dagger
 :man, and young Drop-heir that killed
 :lusty Pudding, and Master Forth-light the tilter, and
 :brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveler, and wild
 :Half-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more,
S:
 :all great doers in our trade, and are now "for the
 :
S:Lord's sake."
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Abhorson.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ABHORSON  Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
 :
 :POMPEY, [calling]  Master Barnardine, you must rise
 :and be hanged, Master Barnardine.
S:
 :
 :
 :ABHORSON, [calling]  What ho, Barnardine!
 :
 :
 :
 :BARNARDINE, [within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes
 :that noise there? What are you?
 :
 :POMPEY, [calling to Barnardine offstage]  Your friends,
S:sir, the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise
 :
 :and be put to death.
 :
 :
 :
 :BARNARDINE, [within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am
S:sleepy.
 :
S:
 :
 :ABHORSON, [to Pompey]  Tell him he must awake, and
 :
 :that quickly too.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY, [calling]  Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till
 :you are executed, and sleep afterwards.
 :
 :ABHORSON  Go in to him, and fetch him out.
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  He is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his
 :
 :straw rustle.
 :
S:
 :
 :ABHORSON  Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Very ready, sir.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Barnardine.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BARNARDINE  How now, Abhorson? What's the news
 :with you?
 :
 :ABHORSON  Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into
 :your prayers, for, look you, the warrant's come.
S:
 :
 :
 :BARNARDINE  You rogue, I have been drinking all night.
 :
 :I am not fitted for 't.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  O, the better, sir, for he that drinks all night
S:and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the
 :
 :sounder all the next day.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Duke, as a Friar.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:ABHORSON, [to Barnardine]  Look you, sir, here comes
 :
 :your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, to Barnardine]  Sir, induced by my
 :charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I
 :am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with
 :you.
 :
S:BARNARDINE  Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all
 :
 :night, and I will have more time to prepare me, or
 :
 :they shall beat out my brains with billets. I will not
 :
 :consent to die this day, that's certain.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  O, sir, you must. And therefore I
 :
 :beseech you look forward on the journey you shall
 :
 :go.
 :
 :BARNARDINE  I swear I will not die today for any man's
 :persuasion.
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  But hear you--
 :
 :
 :
 :BARNARDINE  Not a word. If you have anything to say to
 :
 :me, come to my ward, for thence will not I today.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
 :After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
S:
 :[Abhorson and Pompey exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Provost.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
S:A creature unprepared, unmeet for death,
 :
 :And to transport him in the mind he is
 :
S:Were damnable.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  Here in the prison, father,
 :
 :There died this morning of a cruel fever
 :One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
 :A man of Claudio's years, his beard and head
 :Just of his color. What if we do omit
 :This reprobate till he were well inclined,
 :And satisfy the Deputy with the visage
S:
 :Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
 :Dispatch it presently. The hour draws on
S:Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done
 :
 :And sent according to command, whiles I
 :
 :Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :This shall be done, good father, presently.
 :But Barnardine must die this afternoon,
 :And how shall we continue Claudio,
 :To save me from the danger that might come
S:
 :If he were known alive?
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]  Let this be done:
 :
 :Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and
 :
 :Claudio.
 :
 :Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
 :To yonder generation, you shall find
S:Your safety manifested.
 :
 :
 :
S:PROVOST  I am your free dependent.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
 :[Provost exits.]
 :
 :DUKE
 :Now will I write letters to Angelo--
S:The Provost he shall bear them--whose contents
 :
 :Shall witness to him I am near at home
 :
 :And that by great injunctions I am bound
 :
 :To enter publicly. Him I'll desire
 :To meet me at the consecrated fount
 :A league below the city; and from thence,
 :By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
 :We shall proceed with Angelo.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Provost, carrying a head.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :
 :Here is the head. I'll carry it myself.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Convenient is it. Make a swift return,
 :For I would commune with you of such things
 :That want no ear but yours.
S:
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  I'll make all speed.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [within]  Peace, ho, be here.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
 :
 :If yet her brother's pardon be come hither.
 :But I will keep her ignorant of her good
 :To make her heavenly comforts of despair
 :When it is least expected.
 :
S:[Enter Isabella.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Ho, by your leave.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
 :
S:ISABELLA
 :
 :The better, given me by so holy a man.
 :
 :Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother's pardon?
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :He hath released him, Isabel, from the world.
 :His head is off, and sent to Angelo.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :Nay, but it is not so.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  It is no other.
 :
S:Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :You shall not be admitted to his sight.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:
 :Unhappy Claudio, wretched Isabel,
 :
 :Injurious world, most damned Angelo!
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.
 :Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.
 :Mark what I say, which you shall find
S:By every syllable a faithful verity.
 :
 :The Duke comes home tomorrow--nay, dry your
 :
S:eyes.
 :
 :One of our convent, and his confessor,
 :
 :Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
 :
 :Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
 :Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
 :There to give up their power. If you can, pace your
 :wisdom
 :In that good path that I would wish it go,
 :And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
S:
 :Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
 :
 :And general honor.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  I am directed by you.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar, showing her a paper]
 :This letter, then, to Friar Peter give.
 :'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
S:
 :Say, by this token, I desire his company
 :
 :At Mariana's house tonight. Her cause and yours
 :
 :I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
 :
S:Before the Duke, and to the head of Angelo
 :
 :Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
 :
 :I am combined by a sacred vow
 :
 :And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
 :[He hands her the paper.]
 :Command these fretting waters from your eyes
S:With a light heart. Trust not my holy order
 :
 :If I pervert your course.--Who's here?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucio.]
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Good even, friar, where's the Provost?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Not within, sir.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  O, pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
 :
 :thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to
 :
 :dine and sup with water and bran. I dare not for my
 :head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me to
 :'t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By
 :my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old
 :fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home,
S:
 :he had lived.	[Isabella exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Sir, the Duke is marvelous little beholdin
 :g
 :to your reports, but the best is, he lives not
 :in them.
 :
 :LUCIO  Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do.
 :He's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare
 :
 :you well.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Nay, tarry, I'll go along with thee. I can tell thee
 :pretty tales of the Duke.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  You have told me too many of him
S:
 :already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were
 :
 :enough.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  I was once before him for getting a wench with
 :child.
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Did you such a thing?
 :
S:
 :LUCIO  Yes, marry, did I, but I was fain to forswear it.
 :
 :They would else have married me to the rotten
 :
 :medlar.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Sir, your company is fairer than honest.
 :
 :Rest you well.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If
S:bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it.
 :
 :Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr. I shall stick.

 :=======
 :[Enter Angelo and Escalus.]
 :
 :
S:
 :ESCALUS  Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched
 :
 :other.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  In most uneven and distracted manner. His
 :
 :actions show much like to madness. Pray heaven his
 :
 :wisdom be not tainted. And why meet him at the
S:gates and deliver our authorities there?
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  I guess not.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  And why should we proclaim it in an hour
 :before his entering, that if any crave redress of
 :injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the
 :street?
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch
 :
S:of complaints, and to deliver us from devices
 :
 :hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
 :
 :against us.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  Well, I beseech you let it be proclaimed.
 :Betimes i' th' morn, I'll call you at your house. Give
 :notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
 :him.
 :
S:
 :ESCALUS  I shall, sir. Fare you well.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Good night.	[Escalus exits.]
 :
 :This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
 :
 :And dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid,
S:And by an eminent body that enforced
 :
 :The law against it. But that her tender shame
 :
 :Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
 :
 :How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,
 :For my authority bears of a credent bulk
 :That no particular scandal once can touch
 :But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
 :Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
 :Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge
S:
 :By so receiving a dishonored life
 :
 :With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.
 :
 :Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
 :
 :Nothing goes right. We would, and we would not.

 :=======
 :[Enter Duke, Varrius, Lords, Angelo, Escalus, Lucio,
 :Provost, Officers, and Citizens at several doors.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [to Angelo]
 :
 :My very worthy cousin, fairly met.
 :[To Escalus.] Our old and faithful friend, we are
 :glad to see you.
 :
 :ANGELO, ESCALUS
 :Happy return be to your royal Grace.
S:
 :

S:
 :ANGELO  You make my bonds still greater.
 :
 :
 :

 :
S:O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it
 :
 :To lock it in the wards of covert bosom

S:A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time

S:That outward courtesies would fain proclaim

 :FRIAR PETER, [to Isabella]
S:
 :Now is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [kneeling]
 :
S:Justice, O royal duke. Vail your regard
 :
 :Upon a wronged--I would fain have said, a maid.
 :
 :O worthy prince, dishonor not your eye
 :
 :By throwing it on any other object
 :Till you have heard me in my true complaint
 :And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.
 :
 :DUKE
 :Relate your wrongs. In what, by whom? Be brief.
S:
 :Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.
 :
 :Reveal yourself to him.
 :
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA  O worthy duke,
 :
 :You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
 :
 :Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak
 :
 :Must either punish me, not being believed,
 :Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me,
 :here.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.
S:
 :She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
 :
 :Cut off by course of justice.
 :
 :
 :
S:ISABELLA, [standing]  By course of justice!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
 :
 :ISABELLA
S:Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak.
 :
 :That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
 :
 :That Angelo's a murderer, is 't not strange?
 :
 :That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
 :An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
 :Is it not strange, and strange?
 :
 :DUKE  Nay, it is ten times strange.
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :It is not truer he is Angelo
 :
 :Than this is all as true as it is strange.
 :
 :Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth
 :To th' end of reck'ning.
 :
 :DUKE  Away with her. Poor soul,
S:She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
 :There is another comfort than this world,
 :That thou neglect me not with that opinion
 :That I am touched with madness. Make not
 :impossible
S:That which but seems unlike. 'Tis not impossible
 :
 :But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
 :
 :May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
 :
 :As Angelo. Even so may Angelo,
 :In all his dressings, caracts, titles, forms,
S:Be an archvillain. Believe it, royal prince,
 :
S:If he be less, he's nothing, but he's more,
 :
 :Had I more name for badness.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE  By mine honesty,
 :
 :If she be mad--as I believe no other--
 :
 :Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
 :Such a dependency of thing on thing,
 :As e'er I heard in madness.
 :
 :ISABELLA  O gracious duke,
S:Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
 :
 :For inequality, but let your reason serve
 :
 :To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
 :
 :And hide the false seems true.
 :
 :DUKE  Many that are not mad
 :Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you
 :say?
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
S:I am the sister of one Claudio,
 :
 :Condemned upon the act of fornication
 :
S:To lose his head, condemned by Angelo.
 :
 :I, in probation of a sisterhood,
 :
 :Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
 :
 :As then the messenger--
 :
 :LUCIO, [to Duke]  That's I, an 't like your Grace.
 :I came to her from Claudio and desired her
 :To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
S:For her poor brother's pardon.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [to Duke]  That's he indeed.
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [to Lucio]
 :You were not bid to speak.
 :
 :LUCIO  No, my good lord,
 :Nor wished to hold my peace.
S:
 :
 :
S:DUKE  I wish you now, then.
 :
 :Pray you take note of it, and when you have
 :
 :A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
 :
 :Be perfect.
 :
 :LUCIO  I warrant your Honor.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :The warrant's for yourself. Take heed to 't.
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
 :
 :LUCIO  Right.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :It may be right, but you are i' the wrong
 :
 :To speak before your time.--Proceed.
 :
 :ISABELLA  I went
 :To this pernicious caitiff deputy--
 :
 :DUKE
S:
 :That's somewhat madly spoken.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  Pardon it;
 :
 :The phrase is to the matter.
 :
 :DUKE
 :Mended again. The matter; proceed.
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :In brief, to set the needless process by:
 :
 :How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,
 :How he refelled me, and how I replied--
 :For this was of much length--the vile conclusion
 :I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
 :He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
 :To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
S:
 :Release my brother; and after much debatement,
 :
 :My sisterly remorse confutes mine honor,
 :
 :And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
 :
 :His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
 :For my poor brother's head.
 :
 :DUKE  This is most likely!
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :O, that it were as like as it is true!
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what
 :
 :thou speak'st,
 :
 :Or else thou art suborned against his honor
S:In hateful practice. First, his integrity
 :
 :Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
 :
 :That with such vehemency he should pursue
 :
 :Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
 :He would have weighed thy brother by himself
 :And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.
S:Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
 :
 :Thou cam'st here to complain.
 :
S:
 :
 :ISABELLA  And is this all?
 :
 :Then, O you blessed ministers above,
 :
 :Keep me in patience, and with ripened time
 :Unfold the evil which is here wrapped up
 :In countenance. Heaven shield your Grace from
 :woe,
 :As I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go.
 :
S:
 :DUKE
 :
 :I know you'd fain be gone.--An officer!
 :
 :[An Officer comes forward.]
 :
 :To prison with her. Shall we thus permit
 :A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
 :On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.--
 :Who knew of your intent and coming hither?
 :
S:
 :ISABELLA
 :
 :One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
 :
 :[Officer exits with Isabella.]
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
 :
S:LUCIO
 :
 :My lord, I know him. 'Tis a meddling friar.
 :
 :I do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord,
 :
 :For certain words he spake against your Grace
S:In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE

 :Words against me? This' a good friar, belike.
 :And to set on this wretched woman here
 :Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
 :
 :LUCIO
 :But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
S:
 :I saw them at the prison. A saucy friar,
 :
 :A very scurvy fellow.
 :
 :
 :
 :FRIAR PETER, [to Duke]  Blessed be your royal Grace.
 :I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
 :Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman
 :Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
 :Who is as free from touch or soil with her
S:
 :As she from one ungot.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  We did believe no less.
 :
 :Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
 :
 :FRIAR PETER
 :I know him for a man divine and holy,
 :Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
S:
 :As he's reported by this gentleman;
 :
 :And on my trust, a man that never yet
 :
 :Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIO
 :
S:My lord, most villainously, believe it.
 :
 :
 :
S:FRIAR PETER
 :
 :Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
 :
 :But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
 :
 :Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
 :Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
 :Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither
 :To speak as from his mouth, what he doth know
 :Is true and false, and what he with his oath
 :And all probation will make up full clear
S:
 :Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman,
 :
 :To justify this worthy nobleman,
 :
 :So vulgarly and personally accused,
 :
S:Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
 :
 :Till she herself confess it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  Good friar, let's hear it.--
 :Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
 :O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!--
S:Give us some seats.--Come, cousin Angelo,
 :
S:In this I'll be impartial. Be you judge
 :
 :Of your own cause.	[Duke and Angelo are seated.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Mariana, veiled.]
 :
 :Is this the witness, friar?
 :First, let her show her face, and after speak.
 :
 :MARIANA
S:
S:Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face
 :
 :Until my husband bid me.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  What, are you married?
 :
S:MARIANA  No, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  Are you a maid?
 :
S:
 :
 :MARIANA  No, my lord.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE  A widow, then?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  Neither, my lord.
 :
 :DUKE  Why you are nothing, then, neither maid, widow,
 :nor wife?
 :
 :LUCIO  My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them
S:
 :are neither maid, widow, nor wife.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE  Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause
 :
 :to prattle for himself.
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  Well, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
S:MARIANA
 :
 :My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,
 :
 :And I confess besides I am no maid.
 :
 :I have known my husband, yet my husband
 :Knows not that ever he knew me.
 :
 :LUCIO  He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.
 :
 :DUKE  For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so
S:
S:too.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  Well, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
 :
 :MARIANA  Now I come to 't, my lord.
 :She that accuses him of fornication
 :In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband,
S:
 :And charges him, my lord, with such a time
 :
 :When, I'll depose, I had him in mine arms
 :
 :With all th' effect of love.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Charges she more than me?
 :
S:
 :
 :MARIANA  Not that I know.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE  No? You say your husband.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIANA
 :
 :Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
 :Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
 :But knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel's.
 :
 :ANGELO
 :This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARIANA
 :
 :My husband bids me. Now I will unmask.
 :
 :[She removes her veil.]
 :This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
 :Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on.
 :This is the hand which, with a vowed contract,
S:Was fast belocked in thine. This is the body
 :
 :That took away the match from Isabel
 :
 :And did supply thee at thy garden house
 :
 :In her imagined person.
 :
 :DUKE, [to Angelo]  Know you this woman?
 :
 :LUCIO  Carnally, she says.
 :
S:
 :DUKE  Sirrah, no more.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  Enough, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
 :
 :My lord, I must confess I know this woman,
 :And five years since there was some speech of
 :marriage
 :Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,
 :Partly for that her promised proportions
 :Came short of composition, but in chief
S:
 :For that her reputation was disvalued
 :
 :In levity. Since which time of five years
 :
 :I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
 :
 :Upon my faith and honor.
 :
 :MARIANA, [kneeling, to Duke]  Noble prince,
 :As there comes light from heaven and words from
 :breath,
S:
 :As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
 :
 :I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
 :
 :As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
 :
S:But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden house
 :
 :He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
 :
 :Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
 :
 :Or else forever be confixed here
 :A marble monument.
 :
 :ANGELO  I did but smile till now.
 :Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice.
 :My patience here is touched. I do perceive
S:
 :These poor informal women are no more
 :
 :But instruments of some more mightier member
 :
 :That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
 :
 :To find this practice out.
 :
 :DUKE  Ay, with my heart,
 :And punish them to your height of pleasure.--
 :Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
S:
 :Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy
 :
 :oaths,
 :
 :Though they would swear down each particular
 :
S:saint,
 :
 :Were testimonies against his worth and credit
 :
 :That's sealed in approbation?--You, Lord Escalus,
 :
 :Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
 :To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
 :[The Duke rises. Escalus is seated.]
 :There is another friar that set them on.
 :Let him be sent for.
 :
S:
 :FRIAR PETER
 :
 :Would he were here, my lord, for he indeed
 :
 :Hath set the women on to this complaint;
 :
 :Your provost knows the place where he abides,
 :And he may fetch him.
 :
 :DUKE, [to Provost]  Go, do it instantly.
 :[Provost exits.]
S:
 :[To Angelo.] And you, my noble and well-warranted
 :
 :cousin,
 :
 :Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
 :
S:Do with your injuries as seems you best
 :
 :In any chastisement. I for a while
 :
 :Will leave you; but stir not you till you have
 :
 :Well determined upon these slanderers.
 :
 :ESCALUS  My lord, we'll do it throughly.	[Duke exits.]
 :Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar
 :Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
 :
S:
 :LUCIO  Cucullus non facit monachum, honest in nothing
 :
 :but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most
 :
 :villainous speeches of the Duke.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCALUS  We shall entreat you to abide here till he
 :
 :come, and enforce them against him. We shall find
 :
 :this friar a notable fellow.
 :
 :LUCIO  As any in Vienna, on my word.
 :
 :ESCALUS  Call that same Isabel here once again. I would
 :speak with her.	[An Attendant exits.]
S:
 :[To Angelo.] Pray you, my lord, give me leave to
 :
 :question. You shall see how I'll handle her.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  Not better than he, by her own report.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Say you?
 :
 :
S:LUCIO  Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
 :
 :she would sooner confess; perchance publicly she'll
 :
 :be ashamed.
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  I will go darkly to work with her.
 :
 :LUCIO  That's the way, for women are light at midnight.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Duke as a Friar, Provost, and Isabella,
 :
 :with Officers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Isabella]  Come on, mistress. Here's a gentlewo
 :man
 :denies all that you have said.
 :
S:
 :LUCIO  My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here
 :
 :with the Provost.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  In very good time. Speak not you to him till
 :we call upon you.
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  Mum.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to disguised Duke]  Come, sir, did you set
S:these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have
 :
 :confessed you did.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :'Tis false.
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  How? Know you where you are?
 :
S:DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Respect to your great place, and let the devil
 :
 :Be sometime honored for his burning throne.
 :
 :Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :The Duke's in us, and we will hear you speak.
 :Look you speak justly.
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]
 :
 :Boldly, at least.--But, O, poor souls,
 :
 :Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
S:Good night to your redress. Is the Duke gone?
 :
 :Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust
 :
 :Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
 :
 :And put your trial in the villain's mouth
 :Which here you come to accuse.
 :
 :LUCIO
 :This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
 :
S:
 :ESCALUS, [to disguised Duke]
 :
 :Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
 :
 :Is 't not enough thou hast suborned these women
 :
S:To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
 :
 :And in the witness of his proper ear,
 :
 :To call him villain? And then to glance from him
 :
 :To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?--
 :Take him hence. To th' rack with him. We'll touse
 :him
 :Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
 :What? "Unjust"?
 :
S:
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Be not so hot. The Duke
 :
 :Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
 :
 :Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,
 :
 :Nor here provincial. My business in this state
 :Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
 :Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
 :Till it o'errun the stew. Laws for all faults,
 :But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
S:
 :Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
 :
 :As much in mock as mark.
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS  Slander to th' state!
 :Away with him to prison.
 :
 :ANGELO, [to Lucio]
S:What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
 :
 :Is this the man that you did tell us of?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  'Tis he, my lord.--Come hither, Goodman Baldpate.
 :Do you know me?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  I remember you, sir, by the sound of
 :your voice. I met you at the prison in the absence of
S:the Duke.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  O, did you so? And do you remember what you
 :
 :said of the Duke?
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Most notedly, sir.
 :
 :LUCIO  Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger,
 :a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to
S:
 :be?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  You must, sir, change persons with me
 :
 :ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so
 :of him, and much more, much worse.
S:
 :
 :LUCIO  O, thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by
 :
S:the nose for thy speeches?
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  I protest I love the Duke as I love
 :
 :myself.
S:
 :
 :ANGELO  Hark how the villain would close now, after
 :
 :his treasonable abuses!
 :
 :
S:ESCALUS  Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away
 :
 :with him to prison. Where is the Provost? [Provost
 :
 :comes forward.] Away with him to prison. Lay bolts
 :
 :enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away
S:with those giglets too, and with the other confederate
 :
 :companion.
 :
 :[Provost seizes the disguised Duke.]
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [as Friar]  Stay, sir, stay awhile.
 :
 :ANGELO  What, resists he?--Help him, Lucio.
 :
 :LUCIO, [to the disguised Duke]  Come, sir, come, sir,
S:
 :come, sir. Foh, sir! Why you bald-pated, lying rascal,
 :
 :you must be hooded, must you? Show your knave's
 :
 :visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting
 :
 :face, and be hanged an hour! Will 't not off?
 :[He pulls off the friar's hood, and reveals the Duke.]
 :[Angelo and Escalus stand.]
 :
 :DUKE
S:
 :Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke.--
 :
 :First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
 :
 :[To Lucio.] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and
 :
 :you
S:Must have a word anon.--Lay hold on him.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  This may prove worse than hanging.
 :
 :
 :DUKE, [to Escalus]
 :What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.
 :We'll borrow place of him. [To Angelo.] Sir, by your
 :leave.
 :Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence
S:
 :That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
 :
 :Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
 :
 :And hold no longer out.
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  O my dread lord,
 :I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
S:To think I can be undiscernible,
 :
 :When I perceive your Grace, like power divine,
 :
 :Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good prince,
 :
 :No longer session hold upon my shame,
 :But let my trial be mine own confession.
 :Immediate sentence then and sequent death
 :Is all the grace I beg.
 :
 :DUKE  Come hither, Mariana.
S:
 :[Mariana stands and comes forward.]
 :
 :[To Angelo.] Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this
 :
 :woman?
 :
 :
 :ANGELO  I was, my lord.
 :
 :DUKE
S:Go take her hence and marry her instantly.
 :
 :[To Friar Peter.] Do you the office, friar, which
 :
 :consummate,
 :
 :Return him here again.--Go with him, provost.
S:[Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS
 :
 :My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonor
S:Than at the strangeness of it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  Come hither, Isabel.
 :
 :Your friar is now your prince. As I was then
 :Advertising and holy to your business,
 :Not changing heart with habit, I am still
 :Attorneyed at your service.
 :
 :ISABELLA  O, give me pardon
S:
 :That I, your vassal, have employed and pained
 :
 :Your unknown sovereignty.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE  You are pardoned,
 :
 :Isabel.
 :
 :And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
 :
 :Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart,
S:And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
 :
 :Laboring to save his life, and would not rather
 :
S:Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
 :
 :Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
 :
 :It was the swift celerity of his death,
 :
 :Which I did think with slower foot came on,
 :That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.
 :That life is better life past fearing death
S:Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
 :
 :So happy is your brother.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA  I do, my lord.
 :
 :[Enter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost.]
 :
 :
 :DUKE
S:
S:For this new-married man approaching here,
 :
 :Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged
 :
 :Your well-defended honor, you must pardon
 :
S:For Mariana's sake. But as he adjudged your
 :
 :brother--
 :
 :Being criminal in double violation
 :
 :Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
S:Thereon dependent for your brother's life--
 :
 :The very mercy of the law cries out
 :
 :Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
 :
 :"An Angelo for Claudio, death for death."
 :Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
 :Like doth quit like, and measure still for
S:measure.--
 :
 :Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
 :
S:Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee
 :
 :vantage.
 :
 :We do condemn thee to the very block
 :
 :Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like
S:haste.--
 :
 :Away with him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  O my most gracious lord,
S:I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :It is your husband mocked you with a husband.
S:Consenting to the safeguard of your honor,
 :
 :I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,
 :
 :For that he knew you, might reproach your life
 :
 :And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
S:Although by confiscation they are ours,
 :
 :We do instate and widow you with all
 :
 :To buy you a better husband.
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  O my dear lord,
 :I crave no other nor no better man.
 :
 :DUKE
 :Never crave him. We are definitive.
S:
 :
 :
S:MARIANA, [kneeling]
 :
 :Gentle my liege--
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE  You do but lose your labor.--
 :Away with him to death. [To Lucio.] Now, sir, to
 :you.
 :
 :MARIANA
 :O, my good lord.--Sweet Isabel, take my part.
S:
 :Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
 :
 :I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Against all sense you do importune her.
 :Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
 :Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
 :And take her hence in horror.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  Isabel,
 :
 :Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me,
 :
 :Hold up your hands, say nothing. I'll speak all.
 :They say best men are molded out of faults,
S:And, for the most, become much more the better
 :
 :For being a little bad. So may my husband.
 :
 :O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
 :
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :He dies for Claudio's death.
 :
 :
 :
 :ISABELLA, [kneeling]  Most bounteous sir,
 :Look, if it please you, on this man condemned
 :As if my brother lived. I partly think
 :A due sincerity governed his deeds
 :Till he did look on me. Since it is so,
S:Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
 :
 :In that he did the thing for which he died.
 :
 :For Angelo,
 :
 :His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
S:And must be buried but as an intent
 :
 :That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects,
 :
S:Intents but merely thoughts.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIANA  Merely, my lord.
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Your suit's unprofitable. Stand up, I say.
S:[They stand.]
 :
 :I have bethought me of another fault.--
 :
 :Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
 :
 :At an unusual hour?
 :
 :PROVOST  It was commanded so.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Had you a special warrant for the deed?
 :
 :
 :PROVOST
 :No, my good lord, it was by private message.
 :
 :DUKE
 :For which I do discharge you of your office.
S:
 :Give up your keys.
 :
S:
 :
 :PROVOST  Pardon me, noble lord.
 :
 :I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,
 :
 :Yet did repent me after more advice,
S:For testimony whereof, one in the prison
 :
 :That should by private order else have died,
 :
 :I have reserved alive.
 :
 :
 :DUKE  What's he?
 :
S:PROVOST  His name is Barnardine.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
S:Go fetch him hither. Let me look upon him.
 :
 :[Provost exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ESCALUS, [to Angelo]
 :I am sorry one so learned and so wise
 :As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,
S:Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
 :
 :And lack of tempered judgment afterward.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANGELO
S:I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
 :
 :And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
 :
 :That I crave death more willingly than mercy.
 :
 :'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
 :
 :[Enter Barnardine and Provost, Claudio, muffled,
 :and Juliet.]
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE, [to Provost]
 :
 :Which is that Barnardine?
 :
 :
 :PROVOST  This, my lord.
 :
 :DUKE
 :There was a friar told me of this man.--
S:Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul
 :
 :That apprehends no further than this world,
 :
 :And squar'st thy life according. Thou 'rt condemned.
 :
 :But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
 :And pray thee take this mercy to provide
 :For better times to come.--Friar, advise him.
 :I leave him to your hand.--What muffled fellow's
 :that?
 :
S:
 :PROVOST
 :
S:This is another prisoner that I saved
 :
 :Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,
 :
 :As like almost to Claudio as himself.
 :
 :[He unmuffles Claudio.]
 :
 :DUKE, [to Isabella]
 :If he be like your brother, for his sake
 :Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,
 :Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
S:
 :He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
 :
 :By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
 :
 :Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.--
 :
 :Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
 :Look that you love your wife, her worth worth
 :yours.
 :I find an apt remission in myself.
 :And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
S:
 :[To Lucio.] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a
 :
 :coward,
 :
 :One all of luxury, an ass, a madman.
 :
 :Wherein have I so deserved of you
S:That you extol me thus?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the
 :
 :trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had
 :rather it would please you I might be whipped.
 :
 :DUKE  Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.--
 :Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
 :If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow--
S:
 :As I have heard him swear himself there's one
 :
 :Whom he begot with child--let her appear,
 :
 :And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,
 :
 :Let him be whipped and hanged.
 :
S:LUCIO  I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a
 :
S:whore. Your Highness said even now I made you a
 :
 :duke. Good my lord, do not recompense me in
 :
 :making me a cuckold.
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Upon mine honor, thou shalt marry her.
S:Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal
 :
 :Remit thy other forfeits.--Take him to prison,
 :
 :And see our pleasure herein executed.
 :
 :
 :LUCIO  Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
 :whipping, and hanging.
 :
 :DUKE  Slandering a prince deserves it.
 :[Officers take Lucio away.]
S:
 :She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.--
 :
 :Joy to you, Mariana.--Love her, Angelo.
 :
 :I have confessed her, and I know her virtue.--
 :
 :Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness.
 :There's more behind that is more gratulate.--
 :Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy.
 :We shall employ thee in a worthier place.--
 :Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
S:
 :The head of Ragozine for Claudio's.
 :
 :Th' offense pardons itself.--Dear Isabel,
 :
 :I have a motion much imports your good,
 :
 :Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
 :What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.--
 :So, bring us to our palace, where we'll show
 :What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.
 :[They exit.]
