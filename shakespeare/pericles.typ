S:1 Chorus
 :
 :========
 :
 :[Enter Gower.]
 :
 :
 :
S:GOWER
 :
 :To sing a song that old was sung,
 :
 :From ashes ancient Gower is come,
 :
 :Assuming man's infirmities
 :To glad your ear and please your eyes.
 :It hath been sung at festivals,
 :On ember eves and holy days,
 :And lords and ladies in their lives
 :Have read it for restoratives.
S:
 :The purchase is to make men glorious,
 :
 :Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
 :
 :If you, born in these latter times
 :
S:When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes,
 :
 :And that to hear an old man sing
 :
 :May to your wishes pleasure bring,
 :
 :I life would wish, and that I might
 :Waste it for you like taper light.
S:This Antioch, then: Antiochus the Great
 :
 :Built up this city for his chiefest seat,
 :
 :The fairest in all Syria.
 :
 :I tell you what mine authors say.
 :This king unto him took a peer,
 :Who died and left a female heir
 :So buxom, blithe, and full of face
 :As heaven had lent her all his grace;
 :With whom the father liking took
S:
 :And her to incest did provoke.
 :
 :Bad child, worse father! To entice his own
 :
S:To evil should be done by none.
 :
 :But custom what they did begin
 :
 :Was with long use accounted no sin.
 :
 :The beauty of this sinful dame
 :Made many princes thither frame
 :To seek her as a bedfellow,
 :In marriage pleasures playfellow;
 :Which to prevent he made a law
 :To keep her still, and men in awe,
S:
 :That whoso asked her for his wife,
 :
 :His riddle told not, lost his life.
 :
 :So for her many a wight did die,
 :
 :As yon grim looks do testify.
 :[He indicates heads above the stage.]
 :What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
 :I give my cause, who best can justify.

 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles, and followers.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :
 :Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received
 :
 :The danger of the task you undertake.
 :
 :PERICLES
 :I have, Antiochus, and with a soul
 :Emboldened with the glory of her praise
 :Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
S:
 :
 :
S:ANTIOCHUS
 :
 :Music!	[Music sounds offstage.]
 :
 :Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride
 :
 :For embracements even of Jove himself,
 :At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,
 :Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,
 :The senate house of planets all did sit
 :To knit in her their best perfections.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Antiochus' daughter.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:PERICLES
 :
 :See where she comes, appareled like the spring,
 :
 :Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
 :
 :Of every virtue gives renown to men!
 :Her face the book of praises, where is read
 :Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
 :Sorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath
 :Could never be her mild companion.
S:You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
 :
 :That have inflamed desire in my breast
 :
 :To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
 :
S:Or die in th' adventure, be my helps,
 :
 :As I am son and servant to your will,
 :
 :To compass such a boundless happiness.
 :
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :Prince Pericles--
 :
S:PERICLES
 :
 :That would be son to great Antiochus.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :
 :Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
 :
 :With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touched;
 :For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard.
 :Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
 :Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
 :And which without desert, because thine eye
S:Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.
 :
S:[He points to the heads.]
 :
 :Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
 :
 :Drawn by report, advent'rous by desire,
 :
 :Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
 :That, without covering save yon field of stars,
 :Here they stand martyrs slain in Cupid's wars,
 :And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
 :For going on death's net, whom none resist.
 :
S:
 :PERICLES
 :
 :Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
 :
 :My frail mortality to know itself,
 :
 :And by those fearful objects to prepare
 :This body, like to them, to what I must.
S:For death remembered should be like a mirror
 :
 :Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
 :
 :I'll make my will, then, and as sick men do
 :
 :Who know the world, see heaven but, feeling woe,
 :Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
 :So I bequeath a happy peace to you
 :And all good men, as every prince should do;
 :My riches to the earth from whence they came,
 :[To the Daughter.] But my unspotted fire of love to
S:
 :you.--
 :
S:Thus ready for the way of life or death,
 :
 :I wait the sharpest blow.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :Scorning advice, read the conclusion, then:
 :Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
 :As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.
 :
 :DAUGHTER
S:
 :Of all 'sayed yet, mayst thou prove prosperous;
 :
 :Of all 'sayed yet, I wish thee happiness.
 :
S:
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
S:Like a bold champion I assume the lists,
 :
 :Nor ask advice of any other thought
 :
S:But faithfulness and courage.
 :
 :[He reads the Riddle:]
 :
 :I am no viper, yet I feed
 :
 :On mother's flesh which did me breed.
 :I sought a husband, in which labor
 :I found that kindness in a father.
 :He's father, son, and husband mild;
 :I mother, wife, and yet his child.
 :How they may be, and yet in two,
S:
 :As you will live resolve it you.
 :
S:[Aside.] Sharp physic is the last! But, O you powers
 :
 :That gives heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
 :
 :Why cloud they not their sights perpetually
 :
 :If this be true which makes me pale to read it?
 :Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still
 :Were not this glorious casket stored with ill.
S:But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;
 :
S:For he's no man on whom perfections wait
 :
 :That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
 :
 :You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings
 :
 :Who, fingered to make man his lawful music,
 :Would draw heaven down and all the gods to
 :hearken;
 :But, being played upon before your time,
S:Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
 :
 :Good sooth, I care not for you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
S:Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
 :
 :For that's an article within our law
 :
 :As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired.
 :
 :Either expound now or receive your sentence.
S:
 :
 :PERICLES  Great king,
 :
 :Few love to hear the sins they love to act.
 :
 :'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
 :Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
 :He's more secure to keep it shut than shown.
 :For vice repeated is like the wand'ring wind,
 :Blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself;
S:And yet the end of all is bought thus dear:
 :
 :The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
 :
 :To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
 :
 :Copped hills towards heaven, to tell the Earth is
 :thronged
 :By man's oppression, and the poor worm doth die
 :for 't.
 :Kings are Earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
 :And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
S:
 :It is enough you know; and it is fit,
 :
 :What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
 :
 :All love the womb that their first being bred;
 :
 :Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS, [aside]
S:Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the
 :
 :meaning.
 :
 :But I will gloze with him.--Young Prince of Tyre,
 :
 :Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
 :Your exposition misinterpreting,
S:We might proceed to cancel of your days,
 :
S:Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
 :
 :As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.
 :
 :Forty days longer we do respite you,
 :
 :If by which time our secret be undone,
 :This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son.
 :And until then, your entertain shall be
 :As doth befit our honor and your worth.
 :[All except Pericles exit.]
 :
S:
 :PERICLES
 :
 :How courtesy would seem to cover sin
 :
S:When what is done is like an hypocrite,
 :
 :The which is good in nothing but in sight.
 :
 :If it be true that I interpret false,
 :
 :Then were it certain you were not so bad
S:As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
 :
 :Where now you're both a father and a son
 :
 :By your untimely claspings with your child,
 :
 :Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father,
S:And she an eater of her mother's flesh
 :
 :By the defiling of her parents' bed;
 :
 :And both like serpents are, who, though they feed
 :
 :On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
 :Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men
 :Blush not in actions blacker than the night
 :Will 'schew no course to keep them from the light.
 :One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
S:Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
 :
 :Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
 :
 :Ay, and the targets to put off the shame.
 :
 :Then, lest my life be cropped to keep you clear,
S:By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Antiochus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS  He hath found the meaning,
 :For which we mean to have his head.
 :He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
 :Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
S:
 :In such a loathed manner.
 :
 :And therefore instantly this prince must die,
 :
 :For by his fall my honor must keep high.--
 :
 :Who attends us there?
 :
 :[Enter Thaliard.]
 :
 :
S:
 :THALIARD  Doth your Highness call?
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :
 :Thaliard, you are of our chamber, Thaliard,
 :
 :And our mind partakes her private actions
 :To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness
S:We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,
 :
 :Here's poison, and here's gold. [He gives poison and
 :
 :money.] We hate the Prince
 :
 :Of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not
 :To ask the reason why: because we bid it.
 :Say, is it done?
 :
 :THALIARD  My lord, 'tis done.
 :
S:
 :ANTIOCHUS  Enough.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
 :
S:MESSENGER  My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS, [to Thaliard]  As thou wilt live, fly after,
 :
 :and like an arrow shot from a well-experienced
 :archer hits the mark his eye doth level at, so thou
 :never return unless thou say Prince Pericles is
 :dead.
 :
 :THALIARD  My lord, if I can get him within my pistol's
S:
 :length, I'll make him sure enough. So, farewell to
 :
 :your Highness.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIOCHUS
 :

 :My heart can lend no succor to my head.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter Pericles with an Attendant.]
S:
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
 :Let none disturb us. [(Attendant exits.)] Why should
 :this change of thoughts,
 :The sad companion dull-eyed Melancholy,
 :Be my so used a guest as not an hour
 :In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night,
 :The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me
S:
 :quiet?
 :
S:Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun
 :
 :them;
 :
 :And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,
 :
 :Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.
 :Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
 :Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
 :Then it is thus: the passions of the mind
 :That have their first conception by misdread
 :Have after-nourishment and life by care;
S:
 :And what was first but fear what might be done
 :
 :Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.
 :
 :And so with me. The great Antiochus,
 :
 :'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
 :Since he's so great can make his will his act,
 :Will think me speaking though I swear to silence;
 :Nor boots it me to say I honor him
 :If he suspect I may dishonor him.
S:
 :And what may make him blush in being known,
 :
S:He'll stop the course by which it might be known.
 :
 :With hostile forces he'll o'er-spread the land,
 :
S:And with th' ostent of war will look so huge
 :
 :Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
 :
 :Our men be vanquished ere they do resist,
 :
 :And subjects punished that ne'er thought offense;
S:Which care of them, not pity of myself,
 :
 :Who am no more but as the tops of trees
 :
 :Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
 :
 :Makes both my body pine and soul to languish
 :And punish that before that he would punish.

 :[Enter Helicanus and all the Lords to Pericles.]

S:

 :FIRST LORD

 :Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast.

S:SECOND LORD
 :
 :And keep your mind till you return to us
 :
 :Peaceful and comfortable.
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
 :They do abuse the King that flatter him,
 :For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
 :The thing the which is flattered, but a spark
S:
 :To which that wind gives heat and stronger glowing;
 :
 :Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
 :
 :Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.
 :
S:When Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace,
 :
 :He flatters you, makes war upon your life.

S:
 :Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,

S:Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,

 :That ministers a potion unto me
 :
 :That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
 :
 :Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
 :Where, as thou know'st, against the face of death
 :I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
 :From whence an issue I might propagate,
 :Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
 :Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder,
S:
 :The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest,
 :
S:Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
 :
 :Seemed not to strike, but smooth. But thou know'st
 :
 :this:
 :
 :'Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss;
 :Which fear so grew in me I hither fled
 :Under the covering of a careful night,
 :Who seemed my good protector; and, being here,
 :Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
 :I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants' fears
S:
 :Decrease not but grow faster than the years;
 :
 :And should he doubt, as no doubt he doth,
 :
 :That I should open to the list'ning air
 :
 :How many worthy princes' bloods were shed
 :To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
 :To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
 :And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;
 :When all, for mine--if I may call 't--offense,
S:
 :Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence;
 :
 :Which love to all--of which thyself art one,
 :
 :Who now reproved'st me for 't--
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  Alas, sir!
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
S:
 :Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
 :
S:How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
 :
 :And finding little comfort to relieve them,
 :
 :I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
 :Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
 :And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
 :Who either by public war or private treason
S:
 :Will take away your life.
 :
 :Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
 :
 :Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
 :
S:Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.

S:We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,

 :PERICLES
S:Tyre, I now look from thee, then, and to Tarsus
 :
 :Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee,
 :
 :And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
 :
 :The care I had and have of subjects' good
 :On thee I lay, whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
 :I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath.
S:Who shuns not to break one will crack both.

 :
 :[Enter Cleon the Governor of Tarsus, with his wife
 :
S:Dionyza and others.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON
S:My Dionyza, shall we rest us here
 :
 :And, by relating tales of others' griefs,
 :
 :See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
 :For who digs hills because they do aspire
 :Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
S:O, my distressed lord, even such our griefs are.
 :
 :Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
 :
S:But like to groves, being topped, they higher rise.
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEON  O Dionyza,
 :
 :Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
 :
 :Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
 :
 :Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes
 :Into the air, our eyes do weep till lungs
 :Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that
 :If heaven slumber while their creatures want,
 :They may awake their helpers to comfort them.
S:I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
 :
 :And, wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA  I'll do my best, sir.
 :
 :CLEON
 :This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
 :A city on whom Plenty held full hand,
 :For Riches strewed herself even in her streets;
S:
 :Whose towers bore heads so high they kissed the
 :
 :clouds,
 :
 :And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
 :
S:Whose men and dames so jetted and adorned,
 :
 :Like one another's glass to trim them by;
 :
 :Their tables were stored full to glad the sight,
 :
 :And not so much to feed on as delight;
 :All poverty was scorned, and pride so great,
 :The name of help grew odious to repeat.
 :
 :DIONYZA  O, 'tis too true.
 :
S:
 :CLEON
 :
 :But see what heaven can do by this our change:
 :
 :These mouths who but of late earth, sea, and air
 :
 :Were all too little to content and please,
 :Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
 :As houses are defiled for want of use,
 :They are now starved for want of exercise.
 :Those palates who not yet two savors younger
S:
 :Must have inventions to delight the taste,
 :
 :Would now be glad of bread and beg for it.
 :
 :Those mothers who, to nuzzle up their babes,
 :
 :Thought naught too curious, are ready now
 :To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
 :So sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife
 :Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
 :Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping;
S:
S:Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
 :
S:Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
 :
 :Is not this true?
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
S:
 :
S:CLEON
 :
 :O, let those cities that of Plenty's cup
 :
 :And her prosperities so largely taste,
 :
 :With their superfluous riots, hear these tears.
 :The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
 :
 :[Enter a Lord.]
 :
 :
S:
 :LORD  Where's the Lord Governor?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON  Here.
 :
 :Speak out thy sorrows, which thee bring'st in haste,
 :For comfort is too far for us to expect.
 :
S:LORD
 :
 :We have descried upon our neighboring shore
 :
 :A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
 :
 :
 :CLEON  I thought as much.
S:One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
 :
 :That may succeed as his inheritor;
 :
 :And so in ours. Some neighboring nation,
 :
 :Taking advantage of our misery,
 :Hath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power
 :To beat us down, the which are down already,
 :And make a conquest of unhappy men,
 :Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
 :
S:
 :LORD
 :
 :That's the least fear, for, by the semblance
 :
 :Of their white flags displayed, they bring us peace
 :
 :And come to us as favorers, not as foes.
 :
S:CLEON
 :
 :Thou speak'st like him's untutored to repeat
 :
 :"Who makes the fairest show means most deceit."
 :
S:But bring they what they will and what they can,
 :
 :What need we fear?
 :
 :The ground's the lowest, and we are halfway there.
 :
 :Go tell their general we attend him here,
 :To know for what he comes and whence he comes
 :And what he craves.
 :
 :LORD  I go, my lord.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
S:CLEON
 :
 :Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
 :
 :If wars, we are unable to resist.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pericles with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Lord Governor, for so we hear you are,
S:
 :Let not our ships and number of our men
 :
 :Be like a beacon fired t' amaze your eyes.
 :
 :We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre
 :
 :And seen the desolation of your streets;
S:Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
 :
 :But to relieve them of their heavy load;
 :
 :And these our ships, you happily may think
 :
 :Are like the Trojan horse was stuffed within
 :With bloody veins expecting overthrow,
S:Are stored with corn to make your needy bread
 :
 :And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL, [kneeling]
 :The gods of Greece protect you, and we'll pray for
 :you.
 :
 :PERICLES  Arise, I pray you, rise.
 :We do not look for reverence, but for love,
S:
 :And harborage for ourself, our ships, and men.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON, [rising, with the others]
 :
 :The which when any shall not gratify
 :Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
 :Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
 :The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
 :Till when--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen--
S:
S:Your Grace is welcome to our town and us.
 :

 :
 :Which welcome we'll accept, feast here awhile,
 :Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

S:I'll show you those in troubles reign,

 :Losing a mite, a mountain gain.

S:Should house him safe is wracked and split,

 :By waves from coast to coast is tossed.

 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
 :Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
 :Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man
 :Is but a substance that must yield to you,
 :And I, as fits my nature, do obey you.
S:Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,
 :
 :Washed me from shore to shore, and left my breath
 :
 :Nothing to think on but ensuing death.
 :
S:Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
 :
 :To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;

 :
 :[Enter three Fishermen.]
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  What ho, Pilch!
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  Ha, come and bring away the nets!
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  What, Patchbreech, I say!
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  What say you, master?
S:
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Look how thou stirr'st now! Come
 :
S:away, or I'll fetch thee with a wanion.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  Faith, master, I am thinking of the
 :
 :poor men that were cast away before us even now.
S:
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart
 :
 :to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help
 :
 :them, when, welladay, we could scarce help
 :ourselves!
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  Nay, master, said not I as much
 :when I saw the porpoise how he bounced and tumbled?
 :They say they're half fish, half flesh. A plague
S:
 :on them! They ne'er come but I look to be washed.
 :
 :Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST FISHERMAN  Why, as men do a-land: the great
 :
 :ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich
 :
S:misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: he plays
 :
S:and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him and
 :
 :at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such
 :
 :whales have I heard on a' the land, who never leave
 :
 :gaping till they swallowed the whole parish--
 :church, steeple, bells and all.
S:
 :
 :PERICLES, [aside]  A pretty moral.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  But, master, if I had been the sexton,
 :I would have been that day in the belfry.
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  Why, man?
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  Because he should have swallowed
S:
 :me too. And when I had been in his belly, I would
 :
 :have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should
 :
 :never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and
 :
 :parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
 :were of my mind--
 :
S:PERICLES, [aside]  Simonides?
 :
S:
 :
 :THIRD FISHERMAN  We would purge the land of these
 :
 :drones that rob the bee of her honey.
 :
 :
S:PERICLES, [aside]
 :
 :How from the finny subject of the sea
 :
S:These fishers tell the infirmities of men,
 :
 :And from their wat'ry empire recollect
 :
 :All that may men approve or men detect!--
 :
 :Peace be at your labor, honest fishermen.
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  Honest good fellow, what's that? If
 :it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and
 :nobody look after it!
 :
S:
 :PERICLES
 :
 :May see the sea hath cast upon your coast--
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  What a drunken knave was the sea
 :to cast thee in our way!
 :
 :PERICLES
 :A man whom both the waters and the wind
S:
 :In that vast tennis court hath made the ball
 :
S:For them to play upon entreats you pity him.
 :
 :He asks of you that never used to beg.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's
 :them in our country of Greece gets more with begging
 :than we can do with working.
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN, [to Pericles]  Canst thou catch any
 :fishes, then?
S:
S:
 :
 :PERICLES  I never practiced it.
 :
 :
 :
S:SECOND FISHERMAN  Nay, then, thou wilt starve sure,
 :
 :for here's nothing to be got nowadays unless thou
 :
 :canst fish for 't.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :What I have been I have forgot to know,
 :But what I am want teaches me to think on:
 :A man thronged up with cold. My veins are chill
 :And have no more of life than may suffice
S:
 :To give my tongue that heat to ask your help--
 :
 :Which, if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
 :
 :For that I am a man, pray you see me buried.
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Die, quotha? Now gods forbid 't, an I
 :have a gown. Here, come, put it on; keep thee
 :warm. [Pericles puts on the garment.] Now, afore
 :me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home,
S:
 :and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting
 :
 :days, and, moreo'er, puddings and flapjacks, and
 :
 :thou shalt be welcome.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  I thank you, sir.
 :
S:SECOND FISHERMAN  Hark you, my friend. You said you
 :
S:could not beg?
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  I did but crave.
 :
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  But crave? Then I'll turn craver
 :too, and so I shall 'scape whipping.
 :
 :PERICLES  Why, are your beggars whipped, then?
 :
S:
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  O, not all, my friend, not all; for if
 :
 :all your beggars were whipped, I would wish no
 :
 :better office than to be beadle.--But, master, I'll go
 :
S:draw up the net.	[He exits with Third Fisherman.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES, [aside]
 :
 :How well this honest mirth becomes their labor!
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Hark you, sir, do you know where
S:you are?
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Not well.
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Why, I'll tell you. This is called Pentapol
 :is,
 :and our king the good Simonides.
 :
 :PERICLES  "The good Simonides" do you call him?
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be called
 :
 :for his peaceable reign and good government.
 :
 :
S:PERICLES  He is a happy king, since he gains from his
 :
 :subjects the name of "good" by his government.
 :
 :How far is his court distant from this shore?
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Marry, sir, half a day's journey. And
 :I'll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow
 :is her birthday; and there are princes and knights
 :come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney
 :for her love.
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I
 :
 :could wish to make one there.
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  O, sir, things must be as they may;
 :and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal
 :for his wife's soul.
 :
S:
 :[Enter the two other Fishermen, drawing up a net.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  Help, master, help! Here's a fish
S:hangs in the net like a poor man's right in the law:
 :
 :'twill hardly come out. Ha! Bots on 't, 'tis come at
 :
 :last, and 'tis turned to a rusty armor.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :An armor, friends? I pray you let me see it.
 :[They pull out the armor.]
S:Thanks, Fortune, yet, that after all thy crosses
 :
 :Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
 :
 :And though it was mine own, part of my heritage
 :
 :Which my dead father did bequeath to me
 :With this strict charge even as he left his life,
 :"Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
 :'Twixt me and death," and pointed to this brace,
 :"For that it saved me, keep it. In like necessity--
 :The which the gods protect thee from--may 't
S:
 :defend thee."
 :
S:It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it,
 :
 :Till the rough seas, that spares not any man,
 :
 :Took it in rage, though calmed have given 't again.
 :
 :I thank thee for 't; my shipwrack now's no ill
S:Since I have here my father gave in his will.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  What mean you, sir?
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
 :For it was sometime target to a king;
 :I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
 :And for his sake I wish the having of it,
S:
 :And that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court,
 :
 :Where with it I may appear a gentleman.
 :
 :And if that ever my low fortune's better,
 :
 :I'll pay your bounties; till then, rest your debtor.
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
 :
 :PERICLES
S:
 :I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST FISHERMAN  Why, do 'ee take it, and the gods give
 :
 :thee good on 't.
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  Ay, but hark you, my friend, 'twas
 :we that made up this garment through the rough
 :seams of the waters. There are certain condolements,
S:
 :certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll
 :
 :remember from whence you had them.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Believe 't, I will.	[He puts on the armor.]
 :By your furtherance I am clothed in steel,
 :And spite of all the rupture of the sea,
 :This jewel holds his biding on my arm.
 :Unto thy value I will mount myself
S:
 :Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
 :
 :Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
 :
 :Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
 :
S:Of a pair of bases.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND FISHERMAN  We'll sure provide. Thou shalt have
 :

 :Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :
S:[Enter the King Simonides, Thaisa, Marshal, Ladies,
 :
 :Lords, Attendants, and Knights in armor, from tilting.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES  Knights,
 :To say you're welcome were superfluous.
S:To place upon the volume of your deeds,
 :
 :As in a title page, your worth in arms
 :
S:Were more than you expect or more than 's fit,
 :
 :Since every worth in show commends itself.
 :
 :Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast.
 :
S:You are princes and my guests.
 :
 :
 :
 :THAISA, [to Pericles]  But you my knight and guest,
 :
 :To whom this wreath of victory I give
 :And crown you king of this day's happiness.
 :[She places a wreath on Pericles' head.]
 :
 :PERICLES
 :'Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit.
S:
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
 :Call it by what you will, the day is yours,
 :
 :And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
S:In framing an artist, Art hath thus decreed,
 :
 :To make some good but others to exceed,
 :
 :And you are her labored scholar.--Come, queen o'
 :
 :the feast,
 :For, daughter, so you are; here, take your place.--
 :Marshal, the rest as they deserve their grace.
 :
 :KNIGHTS
S:We are honored much by good Simonides.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
S:Your presence glads our days. Honor we love,
 :
S:For who hates honor hates the gods above.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARSHAL, [to Pericles]  Sir, yonder is your place.
 :
 :
S:PERICLES  Some other is more fit.
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST KNIGHT
 :
 :Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen
 :
 :Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
 :
 :Envies the great, nor shall the low despise.
 :
 :PERICLES
S:You are right courteous knights.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES  Sit, sir, sit.	[They sit.]
 :
 :[Aside.] By Jove I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
 :These cates resist me, he not thought upon.
 :
 :THAISA, [aside]
 :By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
 :All viands that I eat do seem unsavory,
S:
 :Wishing him my meat.--Sure, he's a gallant
 :
 :gentleman.
 :
 :
 :
S:SIMONIDES
 :
 :He's but a country gentleman;
 :
 :Has done no more than other knights have done;
 :
 :Has broken a staff or so. So let it pass.
 :
S:THAISA, [aside]
 :
 :To me he seems like diamond to glass.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES, [aside]
 :Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
 :Which tells in that glory once he was--
 :Had princes sit like stars about his throne,
 :And he the sun for them to reverence.
 :None that beheld him but like lesser lights
S:
 :Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;
 :
 :Where now his son's like a glowworm in the night,
 :
 :The which hath fire in darkness, none in light;
 :
 :Whereby I see that Time's the king of men.
 :He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
 :And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES  What, are you merry, knights?
 :
 :
 :
 :KNIGHTS
 :Who can be other in this royal presence?
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,
 :As do you love, fill to your mistress' lips.
S:
 :We drink this health to you.	[He drinks.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KNIGHTS  We thank your Grace.
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
S:As if the entertainment in our court
 :
S:Had not a show might countervail his worth.--
 :
 :Note it not you, Thaisa?
 :
 :
 :
 :THAISA  What is 't to me, my father?
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this
 :Should live like gods above, who freely give
 :To everyone that come to honor them.
S:
S:And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
 :
 :Which make a sound but, killed, are wondered at.
 :
 :Therefore, to make his entrance more sweet,
 :
 :Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
 :[He drinks.]
 :
 :THAISA
S:Alas, my father, it befits not me
 :
 :Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.
 :
 :He may my proffer take for an offense,
 :
S:Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES  How?
 :
 :Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
 :
S:THAISA, [aside]
 :
 :Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
 :Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
 :
 :THAISA, [going to Pericles]
 :The King, my father, sir, has drunk to you.
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  I thank him.
 :
 :
 :
 :THAISA
 :Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
 :
S:PERICLES
 :
 :I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
 :
 :[He drinks to Simonides.]
 :
 :
 :THAISA
S:And further, he desires to know of you
 :
 :Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
S:A gentleman of Tyre, my name Pericles.
 :
 :My education been in arts and arms,
 :
 :Who, looking for adventures in the world,
 :
 :Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
 :And after shipwrack driven upon this shore.
 :
 :THAISA, [returning to her place]
 :He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,
 :A gentleman of Tyre,
S:
 :Who only by misfortune of the seas,
 :
 :Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
 :And will awake him from his melancholy.--
 :Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles
S:And waste the time which looks for other revels.
 :
 :Even in your armors, as you are addressed,
 :
 :Will well become a soldiers' dance.
 :
 :I will not have excuse with saying this:
 :"Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,"
 :Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
 :[They dance.]
 :So, this was well asked, 'twas so well performed.
 :Come, sir.	[He presents Pericles to Thaisa.]
S:
 :Here's a lady that wants breathing too,
 :
 :And I have heard you knights of Tyre
 :
 :Are excellent in making ladies trip,
 :
S:And that their measures are as excellent.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
S:In those that practice them they are, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
 :O, that's as much as you would be denied
 :Of your fair courtesy.	[They dance.]
 :Unclasp, unclasp!
 :Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well;
 :[To Pericles.] But you the best.--Pages and lights, to
 :conduct
S:
 :These knights unto their several lodgings. [To
 :
 :Pericles.] Yours, sir,
 :
S:We have given order be next our own.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  I am at your Grace's pleasure.
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
 :And that's the mark I know you level at.
 :Therefore each one betake him to his rest,
 :Tomorrow all for speeding do their best.

 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Helicanus and Escanes.]
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
S:
 :No, Escanes, know this of me:
 :
S:Antiochus from incest lived not free,
 :
 :For which the most high gods not minding longer
 :
 :To withhold the vengeance that they had in store
 :
 :Due to this heinous capital offense,
 :Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
 :When he was seated in a chariot of
 :An inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
 :A fire from heaven came and shriveled up
 :Those bodies even to loathing, for they so stunk
S:
 :That all those eyes adored them, ere their fall,
 :
 :Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
 :
 :
 :
S:ESCANES  'Twas very strange.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :
 :And yet but justice; for though this king were great,
S:His greatness was no guard to bar heaven's shaft,
 :
 :But sin had his reward.
 :
S:
 :
 :ESCANES  'Tis very true.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter two or three Lords.]
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :See, not a man in private conference
 :Or counsel has respect with him but he.
S:
 :
 :
S:SECOND LORD
 :
 :It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD LORD
 :And cursed be he that will not second it.
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :Follow me, then.--Lord Helicane, a word.
S:
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :
S:With me? And welcome. Happy day, my lords.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :
 :Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
 :And now at length they overflow their banks.
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Your griefs? For what? Wrong not your prince you
 :love.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :
 :Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane.
 :
 :But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,
 :Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
 :If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
 :If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there,
 :And be resolved he lives to govern us,
S:
 :Or dead, give 's cause to mourn his funeral
 :
 :And leave us to our free election.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD
 :Whose death's indeed the strongest in our censure;
 :And knowing this kingdom is without a head--
 :Like goodly buildings left without a roof
 :Soon fall to ruin--your noble self,
S:
 :That best know how to rule and how to reign,
 :
 :We thus submit unto, our sovereign.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL  Live, noble Helicane!
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Try honor's cause; forbear your suffrages.
 :If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
S:
 :Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
 :
 :Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
 :
 :A twelve-month longer let me entreat you
 :
 :To forbear the absence of your king;
 :If in which time expired, he not return,
 :I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
 :But if I cannot win you to this love,
S:Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
 :
 :And in your search spend your adventurous worth,
 :
 :Whom if you find and win unto return,
 :
S:You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :
 :To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield.
 :And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
 :We with our travels will endeavor.
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands.
S:
S:When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.

 :Scene 5
 :=======
 :[Enter the King, Simonides, reading of a letter at one
S:door; the Knights meet him.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST KNIGHT
 :Good morrow to the good Simonides.
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
 :That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
S:
 :A married life. Her reason to herself is only known,
 :
 :Which from her by no means can I get.
 :
 :
 :
S:SECOND KNIGHT
 :
 :May we not get access to her, my lord?
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied her
 :To her chamber that 'tis impossible.
 :One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery.
 :This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed,
S:And on her virgin honor will not break it.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD KNIGHT
 :
 :Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
 :[The Knights exit.]
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES  So,
 :
 :They are well dispatched. Now to my daughter's letter.
 :
 :She tells me here she'll wed the stranger knight
S:Or never more to view nor day nor light.
 :
S:'Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine.
 :
 :I like that well. Nay, how absolute she's in 't,
 :
S:Not minding whether I dislike or no!
 :
 :Well, I do commend her choice, and will no longer
 :
 :Have it be delayed. Soft, here he comes.
 :
 :I must dissemble it.
 :
 :[Enter Pericles.]
 :
S:
 :
S:PERICLES
 :
 :All fortune to the good Simonides.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :To you as much. Sir, I am beholding to you
 :For your sweet music this last night. I do
 :Protest, my ears were never better fed
 :With such delightful pleasing harmony.
S:
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
S:It is your Grace's pleasure to commend,
 :
 :Not my desert.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES  Sir, you are music's master.
 :
 :PERICLES
 :The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
 :
 :SIMONIDES  Let me ask you one thing:
S:
 :What do you think of my daughter, sir?
 :
S:
 :
S:PERICLES  A most virtuous princess.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES  And she is fair too, is she not?
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,
S:
 :Ay, so well that you must be her master,
 :
 :And she will be your scholar. Therefore, look to it.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
 :She thinks not so. Peruse this writing else.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES, [aside]  What's here?
 :A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre?
 :'Tis the King's subtlety to have my life.--
S:O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
 :
 :A stranger and distressed gentleman
 :
S:That never aimed so high to love your daughter,
 :
 :But bent all offices to honor her.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :Thou hast bewitched my daughter, and thou art
 :A villain.
S:
 :
 :PERICLES  By the gods, I have not!
 :
S:Never did thought of mine levy offense;
 :
 :Nor never did my actions yet commence
 :
 :A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
 :
 :
S:SIMONIDES
 :
 :Traitor, thou liest!
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Traitor?
 :
 :SIMONIDES  Ay, traitor.
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Even in his throat, unless it be the King
S:
 :That calls me traitor, I return the lie.
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES, [aside]
 :
 :Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
 :
 :PERICLES
 :My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
 :That never relished of a base descent.
S:
 :I came unto your court for honor's cause,
 :
 :And not to be a rebel to her state,
 :
S:And he that otherwise accounts of me,
 :
 :This sword shall prove he's honor's enemy.
 :
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES  No?
 :
 :Here comes my daughter. She can witness it.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Thaisa.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Then as you are as virtuous as fair,
S:Resolve your angry father if my tongue
 :
 :Did e'er solicit or my hand subscribe
 :
 :To any syllable that made love to you.
 :
 :
 :THAISA
 :Why, sir, say if you had, who takes offense
S:At that would make me glad?
 :
 :
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
 :Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
 :[(Aside.)] I am glad on 't with all my heart.--
 :I'll tame you! I'll bring you in subjection.
 :Will you, not having my consent,
 :Bestow your love and your affections
S:Upon a stranger? [(Aside.)] Who, for aught I know,
 :
 :May be--nor can I think the contrary--
 :
 :As great in blood as I myself.--
 :
 :Therefore, hear you, mistress: either frame
 :Your will to mine--and you, sir, hear you:
 :Either be ruled by me--or I'll make you
 :Man and wife.
 :Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too.
 :And being joined, I'll thus your hopes destroy.
S:
 :And for further grief--God give you joy!
 :
S:What, are you both pleased?
 :
 :
 :
 :THAISA  Yes, [(to Pericles)] if you love me, sir.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Even as my life my blood that fosters it.
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES  What, are you both agreed?
 :
 :
 :
S:BOTH  Yes, if 't please your Majesty.
 :
S:
 :
 :SIMONIDES
 :
S:It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed,
 :
 :And then with what haste you can, get you to bed.

S:[Enter Gower.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :GOWER
 :Now sleep yslacked hath the rout;
 :No din but snores about the house,
 :Made louder by the o'erfed breast
 :Of this most pompous marriage feast.
S:The cat with eyne of burning coal
 :
 :Now couches from the mouse's hole,
 :
 :And crickets sing at the oven's mouth
 :
S:Are the blither for their drouth.
 :
S:Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
 :
 :Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
 :
 :A babe is molded. Be attent,
 :
 :And time that is so briefly spent
S:With your fine fancies quaintly eche.
 :
 :What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Dumb Show.
 :
 :Enter Pericles and Simonides at one door with
 :Attendants. A Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives
 :Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides. The Lords
 :kneel to him; then enter Thaisa with child, with
S:
 :Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter. She
 :
 :rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and
 :
 :depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then
 :
 :Simonides and the others exit.
 :]
 :
 :
 :By many a dern and painful perch
S:
S:Of Pericles the careful search,
 :
 :By the four opposing coigns
 :
 :Which the world together joins,
 :
 :Is made with all due diligence
 :That horse and sail and high expense
S:Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
 :
 :Fame answering the most strange enquire,
 :
S:To th' court of King Simonides
 :
 :Are letters brought, the tenor these:
 :
 :Antiochus and his daughter dead,
 :
 :The men of Tyrus on the head
S:Of Helicanus would set on
 :
 :The crown of Tyre, but he will none.
 :
 :The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress,
 :
S:Says to 'em, if King Pericles
 :
 :Come not home in twice six moons,
 :
 :He, obedient to their dooms,
 :
 :Will take the crown. The sum of this,
 :Brought hither to Pentapolis,
 :Y-ravished the regions round,
S:And everyone with claps can sound,
 :
 :"Our heir apparent is a king!
 :
 :Who dreamt, who thought of such a thing?"
 :
 :Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre.
 :His queen, with child, makes her desire--
 :Which who shall cross?--along to go.
 :Omit we all their dole and woe.
 :Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
 :And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
S:
 :On Neptune's billow. Half the flood
 :
S:Hath their keel cut. But Fortune, moved,
 :
 :Varies again. The grizzled North
 :
 :Disgorges such a tempest forth
 :
S:That, as a duck for life that dives,
 :
 :So up and down the poor ship drives.
 :
S:The lady shrieks and, well-anear,
 :
 :Does fall in travail with her fear.
 :
 :And what ensues in this fell storm
 :
 :Shall for itself itself perform.
 :I nill relate; action may
 :Conveniently the rest convey,
 :Which might not what by me is told.
 :In your imagination hold
 :This stage the ship upon whose deck

S:For a more blusterous birth had never babe.
 :
 :Quiet and gentle thy conditions, for

 :Thou hast as chiding a nativity

 :
 :FIRST SAILOR  What courage, sir? God save you.

S:PERICLES

 :Courage enough. I do not fear the flaw.

S:

 :LYCHORIDA  Here she lies, sir.

 :PERICLES
 :A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear,
S:
S:No light, no fire. Th' unfriendly elements
 :
 :Forgot thee utterly. Nor have I time
 :
 :To give thee hallowed to thy grave, but straight
 :
S:Must cast thee, scarcely coffined, in the ooze,
 :
 :Where, for a monument upon thy bones
 :
 :And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
 :
 :And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
 :Lying with simple shells.--O, Lychorida,
 :Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink, and paper,
 :My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
 :Bring me the satin coffin. Lay the babe

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter Lord Cerimon with two Suppliants.]
S:
 :
S:
 :
 :CERIMON  Philemon, ho!
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Philemon.]
 :
 :
S:PHILEMON  Doth my lord call?
 :
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  Get fire and meat for these poor men.
 :
 :'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
 :[Philemon exits.]
 :
S:FIRST SUPPLIANT
 :
 :I have been in many; but such a night as this,
 :
 :Till now, I ne'er endured.
 :
 :
S:CERIMON
 :
 :Your master will be dead ere you return.
 :
 :There's nothing can be ministered to nature
 :
 :That can recover him. [To Second Suppliant.] Give
 :this to the 'pothecary,
 :And tell me how it works.	[Suppliants exit.]
 :
 :[Enter two Gentlemen.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN  Good morrow.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Good morrow to your Lordship.
 :
 :
 :CERIMON
 :Gentlemen, why do you stir so early?
S:
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Sir,
 :
 :Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
 :
 :Shook as the earth did quake.
 :The very principals did seem to rend
 :And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear
 :Made me to quit the house.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
S:
 :That is the cause we trouble you so early.
 :
 :'Tis not our husbandry.
 :
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  O, you say well.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :But I much marvel that your Lordship, having
 :Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
S:
 :Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
 :
 :'Tis most strange
 :
 :Nature should be so conversant with pain,
 :
 :Being thereto not compelled.
 :
 :CERIMON  I hold it ever
 :Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
S:Than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs
 :
 :May the two latter darken and expend,
 :
 :But immortality attends the former,
 :
 :Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever
 :Have studied physic, through which secret art,
 :By turning o'er authorities, I have,
S:Together with my practice, made familiar
 :
 :To me and to my aid the blessed infusions
 :
S:That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones;
 :
 :And can speak of the disturbances
 :
S:That Nature works, and of her cures; which doth
 :
 :give me
 :
S:A more content in course of true delight
 :
S:Than to be thirsty after tottering honor,
 :
 :Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags
 :
 :To please the fool and death.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :Your Honor has through Ephesus poured forth
 :Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
S:Your creatures, who by you have been restored;
 :
 :And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
 :
 :Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
 :
 :Such strong renown, as time shall never--
 :
 :[Enter two or three Servants with a chest.]
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
S:
 :So, lift there.
 :
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  What's that?
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  Sir, even now
 :Did the sea toss up upon our shore this chest.
 :'Tis of some wrack.
 :
S:
 :CERIMON  Set 't down. Let's look upon 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :
S:'Tis like a coffin, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  What e'er it be,
 :
 :'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight.
 :If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
 :'Tis a good constraint of Fortune it belches upon us.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :'Tis so, my lord.
S:
S:
 :
 :CERIMON  How close 'tis caulked and bitumed!
 :
 :Did the sea cast it up?
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
 :I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
 :As tossed it upon shore.
 :
 :CERIMON  Wrench it open.
S:
 :Soft! It smells most sweetly in my sense.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  A delicate odor.
 :
 :
 :CERIMON
 :As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
 :[They open the chest.]
 :O, you most potent gods! What's here? A corse?
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Most strange!
 :
 :
 :
S:CERIMON
 :
S:Shrouded in cloth of state, balmed and entreasured
 :
 :With full bags of spices. A passport too!
 :
 :Apollo, perfect me in the characters.
 :
 :[He reads.]
 :Here I give to understand,
 :If e'er this coffin drives aland,
S:I, King Pericles, have lost
 :
 :This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
 :
 :Who finds her, give her burying.
 :
 :She was the daughter of a king.
S:Besides this treasure for a fee,
 :
 :The gods requite his charity.
 :
 :If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
 :
 :That ever cracks for woe. This chanced tonight.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :Most likely, sir.
 :
S:CERIMON  Nay, certainly tonight,
 :
 :For look how fresh she looks. They were too rough
 :
 :That threw her in the sea.--Make a fire within;
 :
 :Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
 :[A servant exits.]
 :Death may usurp on nature many hours,
S:And yet the fire of life kindle again
 :
 :The o'erpressed spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
 :
 :That had nine hours lain dead,
 :
 :Who was by good appliance recovered.
 :
 :[Enter one with boxes, napkins, and fire.]
 :
 :Well said, well said! The fire and cloths.
 :The rough and woeful music that we have,
S:
 :Cause it to sound, beseech you. [Music sounds.] The
 :
 :viol once more!
 :
S:How thou stirr'st, thou block! The music there.
 :
 :[Music sounds.]
 :
 :I pray you, give her air. Gentlemen,
 :
 :This queen will live. Nature awakes a warm breath
 :Out of her. She hath not been entranced
 :Above five hours. See how she gins to blow
 :Into life's flower again.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  The heavens, through you,
S:
 :Increase our wonder, and sets up your fame
 :
 :Forever.
 :
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  She is alive. Behold her eyelids--
 :Cases to those heavenly jewels which Pericles hath
 :lost--
S:Begin to part their fringes of bright gold.
 :
 :The diamonds of a most praised water doth
 :
 :Appear to make the world twice rich.--Live,
 :
 :And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
S:Rare as you seem to be.
 :
 :[She moves.]
 :
 :
 :
 :THAISA  O dear Diana,
 :Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Is not this strange?
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Most rare!
S:
 :
 :
 :CERIMON  Hush, my gentle neighbors!
 :
 :Lend me your hands. To the next chamber bear her.
 :
 :Get linen. Now this matter must be looked to,
 :For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;
 :And Aesculapius guide us.

 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON  Fear not, my lord, but think
 :Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn,
 :For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
 :Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
 :Should therein make me vile, the common body,
S:By you relieved, would force me to my duty.
 :
 :But if to that my nature need a spur,
 :
 :The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
 :

S:

 :[Enter Gower.]
 :
 :
 :GOWER
 :Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
S:
 :Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
 :
 :His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
 :
S:Unto Diana there 's a votaress.
 :
 :Now to Marina bend your mind,
 :
 :Whom our fast-growing scene must find
 :
 :At Tarsus, and by Cleon trained
S:In music, letters; who hath gained
 :
 :Of education all the grace
 :
 :Which makes high both the art and place
 :
 :Of general wonder. But, alack,
 :That monster envy, oft the wrack
S:Of earned praise, Marina's life
 :
 :Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
 :
 :And in this kind our Cleon hath
 :
S:One daughter and a full grown wench,
 :
 :Even ripe for marriage rite. This maid
 :
 :Hight Philoten, and it is said
 :
 :For certain in our story she
S:Would ever with Marina be.
 :
 :Be 't when they weaved the sleided silk
 :
S:With fingers long, small, white as milk;
 :
 :Or when she would with sharp needle wound
 :
S:The cambric, which she made more sound
 :
 :By hurting it; or when to the lute
 :
 :She sung, and made the night bird mute,
 :
 :That still records with moan; or when
S:She would with rich and constant pen
 :
 :Vail to her mistress Dian, still
 :
 :This Philoten contends in skill
 :
 :With absolute Marina. So
 :With the dove of Paphos might the crow
 :Vie feathers white. Marina gets
S:All praises, which are paid as debts
 :
 :And not as given. This so darks
 :
 :In Philoten all graceful marks
 :
 :That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
 :A present murderer does prepare
 :For good Marina, that her daughter
 :Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
 :The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
 :Lychorida, our nurse, is dead,
S:
S:And cursed Dionyza hath
 :
 :The pregnant instrument of wrath
 :
 :Prest for this blow. The unborn event
 :
 :I do commend to your content.
 :Only I carry winged Time
 :Post on the lame feet of my rhyme,
 :Which never could I so convey
 :Unless your thoughts went on my way.

 :
 :Thy oath remember. Thou hast sworn to do 't.
 :
 :'Tis but a blow which never shall be known.
 :
 :Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon
 :To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
 :Which is but cold in flaming, thy bosom inflame
 :Too nicely. Nor let pity, which even women
 :Have cast off, melt thee; but be a soldier
S:

 :
S:LEONINE  I will do 't; but yet

 :
S:DIONYZA  The fitter, then,

S:

 :LEONINE  I am resolved.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.]
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :No, I will rob Tellus of her weed
 :To strew thy green with flowers. The yellows, blues,
S:
 :The purple violets and marigolds
 :
 :Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave
 :
 :While summer days doth last. Ay me, poor maid,
 :
 :Born in a tempest when my mother died,
 :This world to me is as a lasting storm,
S:Whirring me from my friends.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :
 :How now, Marina? Why do you keep alone?
 :How chance my daughter is not with you?
 :Do not consume your blood with sorrowing.
S:Have you a nurse of me! Lord, how your favor 's
 :
 :Changed with this unprofitable woe.
 :
 :Come, give me your flowers. O'er the sea marge
 :
 :Walk with Leonine. The air is quick there,
 :And it pierces and sharpens the stomach.--Come,
 :Leonine,
 :Take her by the arm. Walk with her.
 :
S:MARINA  No,
 :
 :I pray you, I'll not bereave you of your servant.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA  Come, come.
S:I love the king your father and yourself
 :
 :With more than foreign heart. We every day
 :
 :Expect him here. When he shall come and find
 :
S:Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
 :
 :He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,
 :
 :Blame both my lord and me that we have taken
 :
 :No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
 :Walk, and be cheerful once again. Reserve
 :That excellent complexion, which did steal
 :The eyes of young and old. Care not for me.
 :I can go home alone.
 :
S:
 :MARINA  Well, I will go,
 :
 :But yet I have no desire to it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA  Come, come,
S:I know 'tis good for you.--Walk half an hour,
 :
 :Leonine, at the least. Remember
 :
 :What I have said.
 :
 :
 :LEONINE  I warrant you, madam.
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while.
 :Pray walk softly; do not heat your blood.
S:
 :What, I must have care of you.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  My thanks, sweet madam.	[Dionyza exits.]
 :
 :Is this wind westerly that blows?
 :
 :LEONINE  Southwest.
 :
 :MARINA
S:
 :When I was born, the wind was north.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONINE  Was 't so?
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :My father, as nurse says, did never fear,
 :But cried "Good seamen!" to the sailors,
S:Galling his kingly hands haling ropes,
 :
 :And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
 :
 :That almost burst the deck.
 :
 :
 :LEONINE  When was this?
 :
 :MARINA  When I was born.
 :Never was waves nor wind more violent,
 :And from the ladder-tackle washes off
S:
 :A canvas-climber. "Ha!" says one, "Wolt out?"
 :
 :And with a dropping industry they skip
 :
 :From stern to stern. The Boatswain whistles, and
 :
S:The Master calls and trebles their confusion.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONINE  Come, say your prayers.
 :
 :[He draws his sword.]
 :
 :MARINA  What mean you?
 :
 :LEONINE
S:If you require a little space for prayer,
 :
 :I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious, for
 :
 :The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
 :
 :To do my work with haste.
 :
 :MARINA  Why will you kill me?
 :
 :LEONINE  To satisfy my lady.
 :
S:
 :MARINA  Why would she have me killed?
 :
 :Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
 :
 :I never did her hurt in all my life.
 :
 :I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
 :To any living creature. Believe me, la,
 :I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly.
 :I trod upon a worm against my will,
S:But I wept for 't. How have I offended
 :
 :Wherein my death might yield her any profit
 :
 :Or my life imply her any danger?
 :
 :
S:LEONINE  My commission
 :
 :Is not to reason of the deed, but do 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :You will not do 't for all the world, I hope.
S:You are well-favored, and your looks foreshow
 :
 :You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately
 :
 :When you caught hurt in parting two that fought.
 :
 :Good sooth, it showed well in you. Do so now.
 :Your lady seeks my life. Come you between,
 :And save poor me, the weaker.

S:These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,

S:There's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead,

 :
 :Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
 :Whom they have ravished must by me be slain.

S:[Enter Pander, Bawd, and Bolt.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDER  Bolt!
 :
 :BOLT  Sir?
 :
 :PANDER  Search the market narrowly. Mytilene is full
S:of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by
 :
S:being too wenchless.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  We were never so much out of creatures. We
 :
 :have but poor three, and they can do no more than
 :they can do; and they with continual action are
S:even as good as rotten.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDER  Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we
 :
 :pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be
 :used in every trade, we shall never prosper.
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Thou sayst true. 'Tis not our bringing up of poor
 :
S:bastards--as I think I have brought up some
 :
S:eleven--
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again. But
 :
 :shall I search the market?
 :
S:BAWD  What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong
 :
 :wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully
 :
 :sodden.
 :
 :
 :PANDER  Thou sayst true. There's two unwholesome, a'
S:conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead that
 :
 :lay with the little baggage.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Ay, she quickly pooped him. She made him
 :roast-meat for worms. But I'll go search the
 :market.	[He exits.]
 :
 :PANDER  Three or four thousand chequins were as
 :pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
S:
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get
 :
S:when we are old?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDER  O, our credit comes not in like the commodity,
 :
 :nor the commodity wages not with the danger.
 :Therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some
 :pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door
 :hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon
 :with the gods will be strong with us for giving o'er.
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDER  As well as we? Ay, and better too; we offend
 :worse. Neither is our profession any trade; it's no
 :calling. But here comes Bolt.
 :
 :[Enter Bolt with the Pirates and Marina.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Come your ways, my masters. You say she's a
 :
 :virgin?
 :
 :PIRATE  O, sir, we doubt it not.
 :
 :BOLT  Master, I have gone through for this piece you
 :see. If you like her, so; if not, I have lost my
S:
 :earnest.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Bolt, has she any qualities?
 :
 :
 :BOLT  She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
 :good clothes. There's no farther necessity of
 :qualities can make her be refused.
 :
S:
 :BAWD  What's her price, Bolt?
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDER  Well, follow me, my masters; you shall have
 :
 :your money presently.--Wife, take her in. Instruct
 :
 :her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in
S:her entertainment.	[He exits with Pirates.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Bolt, take you the marks of her: the color of her
 :
 :hair, complexion, height, her age, with warrant of
S:her virginity, and cry "He that will give most shall
 :
 :have her first." Such a maidenhead were no cheap
 :

S:
 :
 :MARINA
 :
 :Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
 :
 :He should have struck, not spoke. Or that these
 :pirates,
S:Not enough barbarous, had but o'erboard thrown me
 :
S:For to seek my mother.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Why lament you, pretty one?
 :
 :
 :MARINA  That I am pretty.
 :
 :BAWD  Come, the gods have done their part in you.
 :
 :MARINA  I accuse them not.
S:
 :
 :
S:BAWD  You are light into my hands, where you are like
 :
 :to live.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  The more my fault, to 'scape his hands where
 :I was to die.
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  No.
 :
S:BAWD  Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
 :
 :fashions. You shall fare well; you shall have the
 :
 :difference of all complexions. What, do you stop
 :
 :your ears?
 :
 :MARINA  Are you a woman?
 :
 :BAWD  What would you have me be, an I be not a
 :woman?
S:
 :
 :
 :MARINA  An honest woman, or not a woman.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAWD  Marry, whip the gosling! I think I shall have
 :
 :something to do with you. Come, you're a young
 :
 :foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would
 :
S:have you.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  The gods defend me!
 :
 :
 :BAWD  If it please the gods to defend you by men, then
S:men must comfort you, men must feed you, men
 :
 :stir you up. Bolt's returned.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Bolt.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
 :
 :BOLT  I have cried her almost to the number of her
S:hairs. I have drawn her picture with my voice.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAWD  And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclinat
 :ion
 :
 :of the people, especially of the younger
 :
S:sort?
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Faith, they listened to me as they would have
 :
S:hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
 :
S:Spaniard's mouth watered an he went to bed to her
 :
 :very description.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  We shall have him here tomorrow with his best
S:ruff on.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Tonight, tonight! But, mistress, do you know the
 :
 :French knight that cowers i' the hams?
 :
 :BAWD  Who? Monsieur Verolles?
 :
 :BOLT  Ay, he. He offered to cut a caper at the proclamation,
 :
S:
 :but he made a groan at it and swore he would
 :
 :see her tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease
 :hither; here he does but repair it. I know he will
 :come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
 :sun.
 :
S:
 :BOLT  Well, if we had of every nation a traveler, we
 :
 :should lodge them with this sign.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD, [to Marina]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You
 :have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you
 :must seem to do that fearfully which you commit
 :willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
 :To weep that you live as you do makes pity in your
S:
 :lovers. Seldom but that pity begets you a good
 :
 :opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  I understand you not.
 :
 :BOLT  O, take her home, mistress, take her home!
 :These blushes of hers must be quenched with
 :some present practice.
S:
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Thou sayst true, i' faith, so they must, for your
 :
 :bride goes to that with shame which is her way to
 :
 :go with warrant.
 :
 :BOLT  Faith, some do and some do not. But, mistress,
 :if I have bargained for the joint--
 :
S:
S:BAWD  Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  I may so.
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like
 :the manner of your garments well.
 :
 :BOLT  Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
 :
S:
 :BAWD  Bolt, spend thou that in the town. [(She gives him
 :
 :money.)] Report what a sojourner we have. You'll
 :
 :lose nothing by custom. When Nature framed this
 :
S:piece, she meant thee a good turn. Therefore say
 :
 :what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest
 :
 :out of thine own report.
 :
 :
 :BOLT  I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so
 :awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty
 :stirs up the lewdly inclined. I'll bring home some
 :tonight.
S:
 :
 :BAWD, [to Marina]  Come your ways. Follow me.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
 :Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
 :Diana aid my purpose!

S:
 :you go with us?

 :
S:
 :DIONYZA
 :
 :Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEON
 :
 :O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
 :
 :The sun and moon ne'er looked upon!
 :
 :
S:DIONYZA  I think you'll turn a child again.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON
 :
 :Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
 :I'd give it to undo the deed. A lady
 :Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
S:To equal any single crown o' th' Earth
 :
 :I' the justice of compare. O villain Leonine,
 :
S:Whom thou hast poisoned too!
 :
 :If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
 :
 :Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say
 :
 :When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
S:
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :
 :That she is dead. Nurses are not the Fates.
 :
 :To foster is not ever to preserve.
S:She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it
 :
 :Unless you play the impious innocent
 :
S:And, for an honest attribute, cry out
 :
 :"She died by foul play!"
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON  O, go to. Well, well,
 :Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
 :Do like this worst.
S:
 :
 :DIONYZA  Be one of those that thinks
 :
 :The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence
 :
 :And open this to Pericles. I do shame
 :To think of what a noble strain you are,
 :And of how coward a spirit.
 :
 :CLEON  To such proceeding
 :Whoever but his approbation added,
S:
 :Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
 :
 :From honorable courses.
 :
 :
 :
S:DIONYZA  Be it so, then.
 :
 :Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
 :
 :Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
 :
 :She did distain my child and stood between
 :Her and her fortunes. None would look on her,
 :But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
 :Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
 :Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through,
 :And though you call my course unnatural,
S:
 :You not your child well loving, yet I find
 :
S:It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
 :
 :Performed to your sole daughter.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON  Heavens forgive it.
 :
 :DIONYZA  And as for Pericles,
 :What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
 :And yet we mourn. Her monument is
 :Almost finished, and her epitaphs
S:
 :In glitt'ring golden characters express
 :
S:A general praise to her, and care in us
 :
 :At whose expense 'tis done.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEON  Thou art like the Harpy,
 :Which, to betray, dost with thine angel's face
S:Seize with thine eagle's talons.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIONYZA
 :
S:You're like one that superstitiously
 :
 :Do swear to the gods that winter kills the flies.
 :
 :But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

S:

 :GOWER
 :
 :Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short,
 :
 :Sail seas in cockles, have and wish but for 't,
 :Making to take our imagination
 :From bourn to bourn, region to region.
 :By you being pardoned, we commit no crime
 :To use one language in each several clime
S:
 :Where our scenes seems to live. I do beseech you
 :
 :To learn of me, who stand in the gaps to teach you
 :
 :The stages of our story. Pericles
 :
 :Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
 :Attended on by many a lord and knight,
 :To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
 :Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
 :Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,
S:
 :Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
 :
 :Advanced in time to great and high estate.
 :
 :Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
 :
 :This king to Tarsus--think his pilot thought;
 :So with his steerage shall your thoughts go on--
 :To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
 :Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
S:Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Dumb Show.
 :
 :
 :Enter Pericles at one door, with all his train, Cleon and
 :Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb,
 :whereat Pericles makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth,
 :and in a mighty passion departs. Cleon and Dionyza exit.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:See how belief may suffer by foul show!
 :
 :This borrowed passion stands for true old woe.
 :
S:And Pericles, in sorrow all devoured,
 :
 :With sighs shot through and biggest tears
 :
 :o'ershowered,
 :
 :Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
 :Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs.
 :He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
 :A tempest which his mortal vessel tears,
 :And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
 :The epitaph is for Marina writ
S:
 :By wicked Dionyza:
 :
 :
 :
 :The fairest, sweetest, and best lies here,
 :
S:Who withered in her spring of year.
 :
 :She was of Tyrus, the King's daughter,
 :
 :On whom foul death hath made this slaughter.
 :
 :Marina was she called, and at her birth,
 :Thetis, being proud, swallowed some part o' th' earth.
 :Therefore the Earth, fearing to be o'erflowed,
 :Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestowed.
 :Wherefore she does--and swears she'll never stint--
 :Make raging battery upon shores of flint.
S:
 :
 :
 :No visor does become black villainy
 :
 :So well as soft and tender flattery.
 :
 :Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
 :And bear his courses to be ordered
 :By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play
S:His daughter's woe and heavy welladay
 :
 :In her unholy service. Patience, then,
 :
 :And think you now are all in Mytilene.	[He exits.]

 :
 :
S:
 :PANDER  Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her
 :
S:she had ne'er come here.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAWD  Fie, fie upon her! She's able to freeze the god
 :
 :Priapus and undo a whole generation. We must
 :
S:either get her ravished or be rid of her. When she
 :
 :should do for clients her fitment and do me the
 :
 :kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
 :
 :her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
 :knees, that she would make a puritan of the devil if
 :he should cheapen a kiss of her.
 :
 :BOLT  Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of
S:all our cavalleria, and make our swearers priests.
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDER  Now the pox upon her greensickness for me!

S:
S:

 :LYSIMACHUS, [removing his disguise]  How now! How a
 :
 :dozen of virginities?
 :
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Now the gods to-bless your Honor!
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  I am glad to see your Honor in good health.
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  You may so. 'Tis the better for you that
 :
 :your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now?
 :
 :Wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
S:withal and defy the surgeon?
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  We have here one, sir, if she would--but there
 :
 :never came her like in Mytilene.
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  If she'd do the deeds of darkness, thou
 :
 :wouldst say?
 :
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Your Honor knows what 'tis to say, well enough.
 :
 :
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS  Well, call forth, call forth.	[Pander exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
 :
 :see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had
 :but--
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  What, prithee?
 :
S:BOLT  O, sir, I can be modest.
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  That dignifies the renown of a bawd no
 :
 :less than it gives a good report to a number to be
 :chaste.
 :
S:[Enter Pander with Marina.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BAWD  Here comes that which grows to the stalk, never
 :plucked yet, I can assure you. Is she not a fair
 :creature?
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Faith, she would serve after a long voyage
S:at sea. Well, there's for you.	[He gives money.]
 :
 :Leave us.
 :
S:
 :
 :BAWD  I beseech your Honor, give me leave a word, and
 :
S:I'll have done presently.
 :
 :

 :
 :
S:BAWD, [to Marina]  First, I would have you note this is
 :
 :an honorable man.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  I desire to find him so, that I may worthily
 :note him.
 :
 :BAWD  Next, he's the governor of this country and a
 :man whom I am bound to.
 :
S:
 :MARINA  If he govern the country, you are bound to him
 :
 :indeed, but how honorable he is in that I know
 :
 :not.
 :
S:
 :
 :BAWD  Pray you, without any more virginal fencing,
 :
 :will you use him kindly? He will line your apron
 :
 :with gold.
 :
 :MARINA  What he will do graciously, I will thankfully
 :receive.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS, [coming forward]  Ha' you done?
S:
 :
 :
 :BAWD  My lord, she's not paced yet. You must take some
 :
 :pains to work her to your manage.--Come, we will
 :
S:leave his Honor and her together. Go thy ways.

 :
 :
 :MARINA  What trade, sir?
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Why, I cannot name 't but I shall offend.
 :
 :MARINA  I cannot be offended with my trade. Please
S:
 :you to name it.
 :
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  How long have you been of this profession?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  E'er since I can remember.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Did you go to 't so young? Were you a
 :gamester at five or at seven?
 :
S:MARINA  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Why, the house you dwell in proclaims
 :
 :you to be a creature of sale.
 :
 :MARINA  Do you know this house to be a place of such
 :resort, and will come into 't? I hear say you're of
 :honorable parts and are the governor of this place.
 :
S:
 :LYSIMACHUS  Why, hath your principal made known
 :
 :unto you who I am?
 :
S:
 :
 :MARINA  Who is my principal?
 :
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Why, your herbwoman, she that sets
 :
 :seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O, you have
 :
 :heard something of my power, and so stand aloof
 :for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee,
 :pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else
 :look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some
S:private place. Come, come.
 :
 :
 :
S:MARINA
 :
 :If you were born to honor, show it now;
 :
 :If put upon you, make the judgment good
 :
 :That thought you worthy of it.
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS
 :
 :How's this? How's this? Some more. Be sage.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  For me
 :That am a maid, though most ungentle Fortune
 :Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
 :Diseases have been sold dearer than physic--
S:That the gods
 :
 :Would set me free from this unhallowed place,
 :
S:Though they did change me to the meanest bird
 :
 :That flies i' the purer air!
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  I did not think
 :Thou couldst have spoke so well, ne'er dreamt thou
 :couldst.
 :Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
 :Thy speech had altered it. Hold, here's gold for thee.
 :Persevere in that clear way thou goest
S:
 :And the gods strengthen thee!	[He gives her money.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  The good gods preserve you.
 :
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  For me, be you thoughten
 :
 :That I came with no ill intent, for to me
 :
 :The very doors and windows savor vilely.
S:Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue,
 :
 :And I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
 :
 :Hold, here's more gold for thee.	[He gives her money.]
 :
S:A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
 :
 :That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
 :
S:Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.

 :BOLT, [at the door]  I beseech your Honor, one piece
 :for me.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Avaunt, thou damned doorkeeper!
S:Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,
 :
 :Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  How's this? We must take another course with
 :you! If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
 :breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
 :shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded
 :like a spaniel. Come your ways.
 :
S:
 :MARINA  Whither would you have me?
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the
 :
S:common hangman shall execute it. Come your

 :way. We'll have no more gentlemen driven away.

 :

 :BOLT  The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
 :nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
 :snowball, saying his prayers too.
 :
 :BAWD  Bolt, take her away, use her at thy pleasure,
 :crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest
S:
 :malleable.

 :BOLT  An if she were a thornier piece of ground than
 :
 :she is, she shall be plowed.

S:
 :never come within my doors.--Marry, hang you!--
 :
 :She's born to undo us.--Will you not go the way of
 :
 :womenkind? Marry come up, my dish of chastity
 :
 :with rosemary and bays!	[Bawd and Pander exit.]
 :
 :BOLT  Come, mistress, come your way with me.
 :
S:MARINA  Whither wilt thou have me?
 :
 :
 :
S:BOLT  To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  Prithee, tell me one thing first.
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Come, now, your one thing.
 :
 :MARINA
 :What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
 :
S:
 :BOLT  Why, I could wish him to be my master, or
 :
 :rather, my mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
S:Since they do better thee in their command.
 :
 :Thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend
 :
 :Of hell would not in reputation change.
 :
 :Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
 :Coistrel that comes enquiring for his Tib.
 :To the choleric fisting of every rogue
 :Thy ear is liable. Thy food is such
S:As hath been belched on by infected lungs.
 :
S:
 :
 :BOLT  What would you have me do? Go to the wars,
 :
 :would you, where a man may serve seven years for
 :
 :the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the
 :end to buy him a wooden one?
 :
 :MARINA
 :Do anything but this thou dost. Empty
S:Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
 :
 :Serve by indenture to the common hangman.
 :
 :Any of these ways are yet better than this.
 :
 :For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
 :Would own a name too dear. That the gods
S:Would safely deliver me from this place!
 :
 :Here, here's gold for thee.	[She gives him money.]
 :
 :If that thy master would gain by me,
 :
 :Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
S:With other virtues which I'll keep from boast,
 :
 :And will undertake all these to teach.
 :
 :I doubt not but this populous city
 :
 :Will yield many scholars.
 :
 :BOLT  But can you teach all this you speak of?
 :
 :MARINA
 :Prove that I cannot, take me home again
S:
 :And prostitute me to the basest groom
 :
 :That doth frequent your house.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Well, I will see what I can do for thee. If I can
 :place thee, I will.

S:MARINA  But amongst honest women.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOLT  Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
 :
S:But since my master and mistress hath bought
 :
 :you, there's no going but by their consent. Therefore

 :Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
 :Into an honest house, our story says.
 :She sings like one immortal, and she dances
 :As goddesslike to her admired lays.

 :
 :Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
 :
 :That even her art sisters the natural roses.

 :Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
S:
 :Where, driven before the winds, he is arrived

 :Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast

 :Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
 :
 :God Neptune's annual feast to keep, from whence

 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
S:[Enter Helicanus, to him two Sailors, one from the
 :
 :Tyrian ship and one from Mytilene.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TYRIAN SAILOR, [to Sailor from Mytilene]
 :
 :Where is Lord Helicanus? He can resolve you.
 :O, here he is.--
 :Sir, there is a barge put off from Mytilene,
S:And in it is Lysimachus, the Governor,
 :
 :Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?
 :
S:
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :
 :That he have his.	[Sailor from Mytilene exits.]
 :
 :Call up some gentlemen.
 :
 :TYRIAN SAILOR  Ho, gentlemen, my lord calls.
 :
S:[Enter two or three Gentlemen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :GENTLEMAN
 :Doth your Lordship call?
 :
 :HELICANUS  Gentlemen,
S:There is some of worth would come aboard.
 :
 :I pray, greet him fairly.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lysimachus, with Lords and Sailor from Mytilene.]
 :
 :
 :SAILOR FROM MYTILENE, [to Lysimachus]  Sir,
 :This is the man that can, in aught you would,
S:Resolve you.
 :
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS, [to Helicanus]
 :
 :Hail, reverend sir. The gods preserve you.
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  And you, to outlive the age I am,
 :And die as I would do.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  You wish me well.
 :Being on shore, honoring of Neptune's triumphs,
S:
 :Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
 :
 :I made to it to know of whence you are.
 :
S:
 :
 :HELICANUS  First, what is your place?
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
S:I am the governor of this place you lie before.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  Sir,
 :
 :Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the King,
 :A man who for this three months hath not spoken
 :To anyone, nor taken sustenance
 :But to prorogue his grief.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
S:
 :Upon what ground is his distemperature?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  'Twould be too tedious to repeat,
 :
 :But the main grief springs from the loss
 :Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  May we not see him?
S:
 :
 :HELICANUS  You may,
 :
 :But bootless is your sight. He will not speak
 :
 :To any.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Yet let me obtain my wish.
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Behold him. [Pericles is revealed.] This was a goodly
S:
 :person,
 :
 :Till the disaster that one mortal night
 :
 :Drove him to this.
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
 :Sir king, all hail! The gods preserve you. Hail,
 :Royal sir!
 :
S:
 :HELICANUS
 :
 :It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene,
 :I durst wager would win some words of him.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  'Tis well bethought.
S:
 :She, questionless, with her sweet harmony
 :
 :And other chosen attractions, would allure
 :
 :And make a batt'ry through his defended ports,
 :
 :Which now are midway stopped.
 :She is all happy as the fairest of all,
 :And, with her fellow maid, is now upon
 :The leafy shelter that abuts against
 :The island's side.
S:
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :
 :Sure, all effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
 :
 :That bears recovery's name.
 :[Lysimachus signals to a Lord, who exits.]
S:But since your kindness
 :
 :We have stretched thus far, let us beseech you
 :
 :That for our gold we may provision have,
 :
 :Wherein we are not destitute for want,
 :But weary for the staleness.
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS  O, sir, a courtesy
 :
 :Which, if we should deny, the most just God
 :
 :For every graft would send a caterpillar,
 :
 :And so inflict our province. Yet once more
 :Let me entreat to know at large the cause
 :Of your king's sorrow.
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :Sit, sir, I will recount it to you. But see,
S:
 :I am prevented.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lord with Marina and her companion.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  O, here's the lady that I sent for.--
 :
 :Welcome, fair one.--Is 't not a goodly presence?
 :
 :HELICANUS  She's a gallant lady.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
 :She's such a one that, were I well assured
S:
 :Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
 :
 :I'd wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.--
 :
 :Fair one, all goodness that consists in beauty:
 :
 :Expect even here, where is a kingly patient,
 :If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
 :Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
 :Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
 :As thy desires can wish.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARINA  Sir, I will use
 :
 :My utmost skill in his recovery, provided
 :
 :That none but I and my companion maid
 :Be suffered to come near him.
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Come, let us
 :
S:Leave her, and the gods make her prosperous.
 :
 :[Lysimachus, Helicanus and others move aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA [sings]
 :[The Song.]
 :
 :
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS, [coming forward]
 :
 :Marked he your music?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  No, nor looked on us.
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS, [moving aside]
 :See, she will speak to him.
 :
 :MARINA, [to Pericles]  Hail, sir! My lord, lend ear.
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Hum, ha!	[He pushes her away.]
 :
 :
 :
S:MARINA  I am a maid, my lord,
 :
 :That ne'er before invited eyes, but have
 :
 :Been gazed on like a comet. She speaks,
 :
 :My lord, that may be hath endured a grief
S:Might equal yours, if both were justly weighed.
 :
 :Though wayward Fortune did malign my state,
 :
 :My derivation was from ancestors
 :
 :Who stood equivalent with mighty kings.
 :But time hath rooted out my parentage,
 :And to the world and awkward casualties
 :Bound me in servitude. [Aside.] I will desist,
 :But there is something glows upon my cheek,
 :And whispers in mine ear "Go not till he speak."
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
 :My fortunes--parentage--good parentage,
 :
S:To equal mine! Was it not thus? What say you?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :
 :I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
 :You would not do me violence.
 :
 :PERICLES  I do think so.
 :Pray you turn your eyes upon me.
 :You're like something that--What
S:
 :countrywoman?
 :
 :Here of these shores?
 :
 :
 :
S:MARINA  No, nor of any shores.
 :
 :Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
 :
 :No other than I appear.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
 :My dearest wife was like this maid, and such
 :A one my daughter might have been: my queen's
 :Square brows, her stature to an inch;
S:
 :As wandlike straight, as silver-voiced; her eyes
 :
 :As jewel-like, and cased as richly; in pace
 :
 :Another Juno; who starves the ears she feeds
 :
 :And makes them hungry the more she gives them
 :speech.--
 :Where do you live?
 :
S:MARINA  Where I am but a stranger.
 :
 :From the deck you may discern the place.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
S:Where were you bred? And how achieved you these
 :
 :Endowments which you make more rich to owe?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA
S:If I should tell my history, it would seem
 :
 :Like lies disdained in the reporting.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Prithee, speak.
S:Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou lookest
 :
 :Modest as Justice, and thou seemest a palace
 :
S:For the crowned Truth to dwell in. I will believe thee
 :
 :And make my senses credit thy relation
 :
 :To points that seem impossible, for thou lookest
 :
 :Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
 :Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
S:Which was when I perceived thee--that thou cam'st
 :
S:From good descending?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  So indeed I did.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
S:Thou hadst been tossed from wrong to injury,
 :
 :And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
 :
 :If both were opened.
 :
 :
 :MARINA  Some such thing I said,
 :And said no more but what my thoughts
S:Did warrant me was likely.
 :
 :
 :
S:PERICLES  Tell thy story.
 :
 :If thine considered prove the thousand part
 :
 :Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
 :
 :Have suffered like a girl. Yet thou dost look
 :Like Patience gazing on kings' graves and smiling
S:Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
 :
 :How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind
 :
 :virgin,
 :
 :Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me.
 :[She sits.]
S:
 :
 :MARINA
 :
 :My name is Marina.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  O, I am mocked,
 :And thou by some incensed god sent hither
 :To make the world to laugh at me!
 :
 :MARINA  Patience, good sir,
S:
S:Or here I'll cease.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Nay, I'll be patient.
 :
S:Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
 :
 :To call thyself Marina.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  The name
S:Was given me by one that had some power--
 :
 :My father, and a king.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  How, a king's daughter?
S:And called Marina?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINA  You said you would believe me.
 :
 :But not to be a troubler of your peace,
 :I will end here.
 :
 :PERICLES  But are you flesh and blood?
 :Have you a working pulse, and are no fairy
 :Motion? Well, speak on. Where were you born?
S:
 :And wherefore called Marina?
 :
S:
 :
 :MARINA  Called Marina
 :
 :For I was born at sea.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  At sea? What mother?
 :
S:MARINA
 :
 :My mother was the daughter of a king,
 :
 :Who died the minute I was born,
 :
 :As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
 :Delivered weeping.
 :
 :PERICLES  O, stop there a little!
 :[Aside.] This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
 :Did mock sad fools withal. This cannot be
S:
 :My daughter, buried.--Well, where were you bred?
 :
 :I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
 :
 :And never interrupt you.
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :You scorn. Believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
 :
S:PERICLES
 :
 :I will believe you by the syllable
 :
 :Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave:
 :
 :How came you in these parts? Where were you bred?
 :
 :MARINA
 :The King my father did in Tarsus leave me,
 :Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife
S:Did seek to murder me; and having wooed a villain
 :
 :To attempt it, who, having drawn to do 't,
 :
 :A crew of pirates came and rescued me,
 :
 :Brought me to Mytilene--But, good sir,
 :Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
 :It may be you think me an impostor.
 :No, good faith.
 :I am the daughter to King Pericles,
 :If good King Pericles be.
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Ho, Helicanus!
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  Calls my lord?
 :
 :PERICLES
S:Thou art a grave and noble counselor,
 :
 :Most wise in general. Tell me, if thou canst,
 :
 :What this maid is, or what is like to be,
 :
 :That thus hath made me weep.
 :
 :HELICANUS  I know not;
 :But here's the regent, sir, of Mytilene
 :Speaks nobly of her.
 :
S:
 :LYSIMACHUS  She never would tell
 :
 :Her parentage. Being demanded that,
 :
 :She would sit still and weep.
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :O, Helicanus! Strike me, honored sir.
 :Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
 :Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
S:
 :O'erbear the shores of my mortality
 :
 :And drown me with their sweetness.--O, come hither,
 :
 :Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget,
 :
S:Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
 :
S:And found at sea again!--O, Helicanus,
 :
 :Down on thy knees! Thank the holy gods as loud
 :
 :As thunder threatens us. This is Marina.--
 :
S:What was thy mother's name? Tell me but that,
 :
 :For truth can never be confirmed enough,
 :
 :Though doubts did ever sleep.
 :
 :
 :MARINA
 :First, sir, I pray, what is your title?
 :
 :PERICLES
 :I am Pericles of Tyre. But tell me now
S:
 :My drowned queen's name, as in the rest you said
 :
 :Thou hast been godlike perfect, the heir of kingdoms,
 :
 :And another life to Pericles thy father.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARINA
 :
 :Is it no more to be your daughter than
 :
 :To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
 :Thaisa was my mother, who did end
S:The minute I began.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
 :Now, blessing on thee! Rise. Thou 'rt my child.--
 :Give me fresh garments.--Mine own Helicanus,
 :She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should
S:Have been, by savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,
 :
 :When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
 :
S:She is thy very princess. Who is this?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS
 :
 :Sir, 'tis the Governor of Mytilene,
 :Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
 :Did come to see you.
 :
 :PERICLES, [to Lysimachus]  I embrace you.--
S:Give me my robes.--I am wild in my beholding.
 :
 :[They put fresh garments on him.]
 :
 :O heavens bless my girl! But hark, what music?
 :
 :Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him o'er
S:Point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
 :
 :How sure you are my daughter.--But what music?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELICANUS  My lord, I hear none.
 :
 :PERICLES  None?
 :The music of the spheres!--List, my Marina.
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS
 :
 :It is not good to cross him. Give him way.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  Rarest sounds! Do you not hear?
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
 :Music, my lord? I hear--
 :
 :PERICLES  Most heavenly music.
S:
 :It nips me unto list'ning, and thick slumber
 :
 :Hangs upon mine eyes. Let me rest.	[He sleeps.]
 :
 :
 :
S:LYSIMACHUS
 :
 :A pillow for his head. So, leave him all.
 :
 :[Lysimachus and others begin to exit.]
 :
 :Well, my companion friends, if this but answer
 :To my just belief, I'll well remember you.
 :[All but Pericles exit.]
 :
 :[Diana descends.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :DIANA
 :
 :My temple stands in Ephesus. Hie thee thither
 :
 :And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
 :There, when my maiden priests are met together,
 :Before the people all,
 :Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.
S:To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call,
 :
 :And give them repetition to the life.
 :
 :Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
 :
 :Do 't, and happy, by my silver bow.
 :Awake, and tell thy dream.	[She ascends.]
 :
 :PERICLES  Celestial Dian,
 :Goddess argentine, I will obey thee.--
S:Helicanus!
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Helicanus, Lysimachus, Marina, and
 :
 :Attendants.]
 :
S:
 :
 :HELICANUS  Sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
 :The inhospitable Cleon, but I am
 :For other service first. Toward Ephesus
 :Turn our blown sails. Eftsoons I'll tell thee why.--
 :Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
S:
 :And give you gold for such provision
 :
 :As our intents will need?
 :
 :
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS  Sir,
 :With all my heart. And when you come ashore,
 :I have another suit.
S:
 :
 :PERICLES  You shall prevail
 :
 :Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems
 :
 :You have been noble towards her.
S:
 :
 :LYSIMACHUS
 :
 :Sir, lend me your arm.
 :
 :
S:PERICLES  Come, my Marina.

 :
S:
 :
 :
 :PERICLES
 :
 :Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command,
 :
S:I here confess myself the King of Tyre,
 :
 :Who, frighted from my country, did wed
 :
 :At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
 :
 :At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
S:A maid child called Marina, whom, O goddess,
 :
 :Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus

S:CERIMON  Noble sir,

S:Upon this coast, I warrant you.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERICLES  'Tis most certain.
 :
 :
 :CERIMON
 :Look to the lady. O, she's but overjoyed.
 :Early one blustering morn this lady was
 :Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
 :Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and placed her
S:
 :Here in Diana's temple.

 :GOWER
 :
 :In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
 :
 :Of monstrous lust the due and just reward.
 :In Pericles, his queen, and daughter seen,
 :Although assailed with fortune fierce and keen,
 :Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
 :Led on by heaven, and crowned with joy at last.
S:In Helicanus may you well descry
 :
S:A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.
 :
 :In reverend Cerimon there well appears
 :
 :The worth that learned charity aye wears.
 :
S:For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
 :
 :Had spread his cursed deed to the honored name
 :
 :Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
 :
 :That him and his they in his palace burn.
 :The gods for murder seemed so content
 :To punish, although not done, but meant.
 :So on your patience evermore attending,
 :New joy wait on you. Here our play has ending.
 :[He exits.]
