 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Camillo and Archidamus.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia
 :
 :on the like occasion whereon my services
 :
 :are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
 :difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
 :
 :CAMILLO  I think this coming summer the King of
 :Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which
S:he justly owes him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  Wherein our entertainment shall shame
 :
 :us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed--
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  Beseech you--
 :
 :
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my
 :knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence--in
 :so rare--I know not what to say. We will give you
 :sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our
 :insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as
 :little accuse us.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  You pay a great deal too dear for what's given
 :
 :freely.
 :
S:
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  Believe me, I speak as my understanding
 :
 :instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to
 :
 :utterance.
 :
S:CAMILLO  Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
 :
 :They were trained together in their childhoods,
 :
 :and there rooted betwixt them then such an
 :
 :affection which cannot choose but branch now.
S:Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities
 :
 :made separation of their society, their encounters,
 :
 :though not personal, hath been royally
 :
 :attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
 :embassies, that they have seemed to be together
 :though absent, shook hands as over a vast, and
 :embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
S:winds. The heavens continue their loves.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  I think there is not in the world either
 :
 :malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
 :comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a
 :gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
 :into my note.
 :
 :CAMILLO  I very well agree with you in the hopes of
S:
 :him. It is a gallant child--one that indeed physics
 :
 :the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went
 :
 :on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
 :
 :see him a man.
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  Would they else be content to die?
 :
S:CAMILLO  Yes, if there were no other excuse why they
 :
 :should desire to live.
 :
 :
 :
 :ARCHIDAMUS  If the King had no son, they would desire
S:to live on crutches till he had one.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo,
S:and Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been
 :The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
S:Without a burden. Time as long again
 :
 :Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks,
 :
 :And yet we should for perpetuity
 :
 :Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher,
 :Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
 :With one "We thank you" many thousands more
 :That go before it.
 :
 :LEONTES  Stay your thanks awhile,
S:
 :And pay them when you part.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  Sir, that's tomorrow.
 :
 :I am questioned by my fears of what may chance
 :Or breed upon our absence, that may blow
 :No sneaping winds at home to make us say
 :"This is put forth too truly." Besides, I have stayed
 :To tire your Royalty.
S:
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  We are tougher, brother,
 :
 :Than you can put us to 't.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  No longer stay.
 :
 :LEONTES
S:One sev'nnight longer.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  Very sooth, tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :We'll part the time between 's, then, and in that
S:I'll no gainsaying.
 :
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES  Press me not, beseech you, so.
 :
 :There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' th'
 :
S:world,
 :
 :So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,
 :
 :Were there necessity in your request, although
 :
 :'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
 :Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder
 :Were in your love a whip to me, my stay
S:To you a charge and trouble. To save both,
 :
 :Farewell, our brother.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Tongue-tied, our queen?
 :
 :Speak you.
 :
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
 :
 :You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
 :Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure
 :All in Bohemia's well. This satisfaction
 :The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him,
 :He's beat from his best ward.
 :
S:
 :LEONTES  Well said, Hermione.
 :
 :
 :
S:HERMIONE
 :
 :To tell he longs to see his son were strong.
 :
 :But let him say so then, and let him go.
 :
 :But let him swear so and he shall not stay;
S:We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
 :
 :[To Polixenes.] Yet of your royal presence I'll
 :
 :adventure
 :
 :The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
 :You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
 :To let him there a month behind the gest
 :Prefixed for 's parting.--Yet, good deed, Leontes,
 :I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind
 :What lady she her lord.--You'll stay?
S:
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES  No, madam.
 :
 :
 :
S:HERMIONE
 :
 :Nay, but you will?
 :
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES  I may not, verily.
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  Verily?
 :
 :You put me off with limber vows. But I,
 :Though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with
S:oaths,
 :
 :Should yet say "Sir, no going." Verily,
 :
 :You shall not go. A lady's "verily" is
 :
 :As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
S:Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
 :
 :Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees
 :
 :When you depart and save your thanks. How say you?
 :
 :My prisoner or my guest? By your dread "verily,"
S:One of them you shall be.
 :
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES  Your guest, then, madam.
 :
 :To be your prisoner should import offending,
 :
 :Which is for me less easy to commit
 :Than you to punish.
 :
 :HERMIONE  Not your jailer, then,
S:But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
 :
 :Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys.
 :
 :You were pretty lordings then?
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  We were, fair queen,
 :Two lads that thought there was no more behind
 :But such a day tomorrow as today,
 :And to be boy eternal.
 :
S:
 :HERMIONE  Was not my lord
 :
 :The verier wag o' th' two?
 :
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES
 :
 :We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i' th' sun
 :
 :And bleat the one at th' other. What we changed
 :
 :Was innocence for innocence. We knew not
S:The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed
 :
 :That any did. Had we pursued that life,
 :
S:And our weak spirits ne'er been higher reared
 :
 :With stronger blood, we should have answered
 :
 :heaven
 :
 :Boldly "Not guilty," the imposition cleared
 :Hereditary ours.
 :
S:HERMIONE  By this we gather
 :
 :You have tripped since.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  O my most sacred lady,
 :Temptations have since then been born to 's, for
 :In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
 :Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes
 :Of my young playfellow.
 :
S:
 :HERMIONE  Grace to boot!
 :
 :Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
 :
 :Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.
 :
 :Th' offenses we have made you do we'll answer,
 :If you first sinned with us, and that with us
 :You did continue fault, and that you slipped not
 :With any but with us.
 :
S:
 :LEONTES  Is he won yet?
 :
 :
 :
S:HERMIONE
 :
 :He'll stay, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  At my request he would not.
 :Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok'st
S:To better purpose.
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  Never?
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Never but once.
 :
S:HERMIONE
 :
 :What, have I twice said well? When was 't before?
 :
 :I prithee tell me. Cram 's with praise, and make 's
 :
 :As fat as tame things. One good deed dying
 :tongueless
 :Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
S:Our praises are our wages. You may ride 's
 :
 :With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
 :
 :With spur we heat an acre. But to th' goal:
 :
 :My last good deed was to entreat his stay.
S:What was my first? It has an elder sister,
 :
 :Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!
 :
 :But once before I spoke to th' purpose? When?
 :
 :Nay, let me have 't; I long.
 :
S:LEONTES  Why, that was when
 :
 :Three crabbed months had soured themselves to
 :
 :death
 :
S:Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
 :
 :And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
 :
 :"I am yours forever."
 :
 :
S:HERMIONE  'Tis grace indeed.
 :
 :Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th' purpose twice.
 :
 :The one forever earned a royal husband,
 :
 :Th' other for some while a friend.
S:[She gives Polixenes her hand.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES, [aside]  Too hot, too hot!
 :
 :To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
 :I have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances,
 :But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment
 :May a free face put on, derive a liberty
 :From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
 :And well become the agent. 'T may, I grant.
S:
S:But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
 :
 :As now they are, and making practiced smiles
 :
 :As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
 :
 :The mort o' th' deer--O, that is entertainment
 :My bosom likes not, nor my brows.--Mamillius,
 :Art thou my boy?
 :
 :MAMILLIUS  Ay, my good lord.
 :
S:
 :LEONTES  I' fecks!
 :
 :Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy
 :
 :nose?
 :
 :They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
 :We must be neat--not neat, but cleanly, captain.
 :And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf
S:Are all called neat.--Still virginalling
 :
 :Upon his palm?--How now, you wanton calf?
 :
 :Art thou my calf?
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS  Yes, if you will, my lord.
 :
 :LEONTES
 :Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I
 :have
S:
 :To be full like me; yet they say we are
 :
 :Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,
 :
 :That will say anything. But were they false
 :
 :As o'erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
 :As dice are to be wished by one that fixes
 :No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
S:To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
 :
 :Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain,
 :
 :Most dear'st, my collop! Can thy dam?--may 't
 :
 :be?--
 :Affection, thy intention stabs the center.
S:Thou dost make possible things not so held,
 :
 :Communicat'st with dreams--how can this be?
 :
 :With what's unreal thou coactive art,
 :
 :And fellow'st nothing. Then 'tis very credent
 :Thou may'st co-join with something; and thou dost,
 :And that beyond commission, and I find it,
 :And that to the infection of my brains
 :And hard'ning of my brows.
 :
S:
 :POLIXENES  What means Sicilia?
 :
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :He something seems unsettled.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  How, my lord?
 :
 :LEONTES
 :What cheer? How is 't with you, best brother?
 :
S:
 :HERMIONE  You look
 :
 :As if you held a brow of much distraction.
 :
 :Are you moved, my lord?
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  No, in good earnest.
 :How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
 :Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
 :To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
S:
 :Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
 :
 :Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched,
 :
 :In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled
 :
 :Lest it should bite its master and so prove,
 :As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.
S:How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
 :
 :This squash, this gentleman.--Mine honest friend,
 :
 :Will you take eggs for money?
 :
 :
S:MAMILLIUS  No, my lord, I'll fight.
 :
 :
 :
S:LEONTES
 :
 :You will? Why, happy man be 's dole!--My brother,
 :
 :Are you so fond of your young prince as we
 :
 :Do seem to be of ours?
 :
 :POLIXENES  If at home, sir,
 :He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
S:Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
 :
 :My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.
 :
 :He makes a July's day short as December,
 :
S:And with his varying childness cures in me
 :
 :Thoughts that would thick my blood.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  So stands this
 :
S:squire
 :
 :Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,
 :
 :And leave you to your graver steps.--Hermione,
 :
 :How thou lov'st us show in our brother's welcome.
 :Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.
 :Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
 :Apparent to my heart.
 :
S:HERMIONE  If you would seek us,
 :
 :We are yours i' th' garden. Shall 's attend you there?
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :To your own bents dispose you. You'll be found,
S:Be you beneath the sky. [Aside.] I am angling now,
 :
S:Though you perceive me not how I give line.
 :
 :Go to, go to!
 :
S:How she holds up the neb, the bill to him,
 :
 :And arms her with the boldness of a wife
 :
 :To her allowing husband!
 :
 :[Exit Hermione, Polixenes, and Attendants.]
 :Gone already.
 :Inch thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a forked
S:one!--
 :
 :Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I
 :
S:Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
 :
 :Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor
 :
 :Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.--There have
 :
 :been,
S:Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
 :
 :And many a man there is, even at this present,
 :
 :Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th' arm,
 :
 :That little thinks she has been sluiced in 's absence,
 :And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by
 :Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there's comfort in 't
 :Whiles other men have gates and those gates
 :opened,
 :As mine, against their will. Should all despair
S:
 :That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
 :
 :Would hang themselves. Physic for 't there's none.
 :
 :It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
 :
S:Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
 :
 :From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,
 :
 :No barricado for a belly. Know 't,
 :
 :It will let in and out the enemy
 :With bag and baggage. Many thousand on 's
 :Have the disease and feel 't not.--How now, boy?
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
S:I am like you, they say.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Why, that's some comfort.--
 :
 :What, Camillo there?
 :
S:CAMILLO, [coming forward]  Ay, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
S:Go play, Mamillius. Thou 'rt an honest man.
 :
 :[Mamillius exits.]
 :
 :Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :You had much ado to make his anchor hold.
 :When you cast out, it still came home.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Didst note it?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
S:He would not stay at your petitions, made
 :
 :His business more material.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Didst perceive it?
 :[Aside.] They're here with me already, whisp'ring,
 :rounding:
 :"Sicilia is a so-forth." 'Tis far gone
 :When I shall gust it last.--How came 't, Camillo,
 :That he did stay?
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  At the good queen's entreaty.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :"At the queen's" be 't. "Good" should be pertinent,
 :
 :But so it is, it is not. Was this taken
 :By any understanding pate but thine?
S:For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
 :
 :More than the common blocks. Not noted, is 't,
 :
S:But of the finer natures, by some severals
 :
 :Of headpiece extraordinary? Lower messes
 :
 :Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :
 :Business, my lord? I think most understand
 :
 :Bohemia stays here longer.
 :
 :LEONTES
 :Ha?
 :
 :CAMILLO  Stays here longer.
S:
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Ay, but why?
 :
 :
 :
S:CAMILLO
 :
 :To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties
 :
 :Of our most gracious mistress.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Satisfy?
S:Th' entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?
 :
 :Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
 :
 :With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
 :
S:My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou
 :
 :Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed
 :
 :Thy penitent reformed. But we have been
 :
 :Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
 :In that which seems so.
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  Be it forbid, my lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :To bide upon 't: thou art not honest; or,
S:If thou inclin'st that way, thou art a coward,
 :
 :Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
 :
 :From course required; or else thou must be
 :
 :counted
 :A servant grafted in my serious trust
 :And therein negligent; or else a fool
S:That seest a game played home, the rich stake
 :
S:drawn,
 :
 :And tak'st it all for jest.
 :
 :
 :
S:CAMILLO  My gracious lord,
 :
 :I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful.
 :
S:In every one of these no man is free,
 :
 :But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
 :
 :Among the infinite doings of the world,
 :
S:Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
 :
 :If ever I were willful-negligent,
 :
 :It was my folly; if industriously
 :
 :I played the fool, it was my negligence,
 :Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
 :To do a thing where I the issue doubted,
 :Whereof the execution did cry out
S:Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
 :
 :Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,
 :
 :Are such allowed infirmities that honesty
 :
S:Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,
 :
 :Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
 :
 :By its own visage. If I then deny it,
 :
 :'Tis none of mine.
 :
S:LEONTES  Ha' not you seen, Camillo--
 :
 :But that's past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass
 :
 :Is thicker than a cuckold's horn--or heard--
 :
 :For to a vision so apparent, rumor
S:Cannot be mute--or thought--for cogitation
 :
 :Resides not in that man that does not think--
 :
S:My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess--
 :
 :Or else be impudently negative
 :
 :To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought--then say
 :
 :My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
S:As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
 :
 :Before her troth-plight. Say 't, and justify 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :I would not be a stander-by to hear
 :My sovereign mistress clouded so without
 :My present vengeance taken. 'Shrew my heart,
 :You never spoke what did become you less
 :Than this, which to reiterate were sin
S:
 :As deep as that, though true.
 :
S:
 :
S:LEONTES  Is whispering nothing?
 :
 :Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
 :
 :Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career
 :
 :Of laughter with a sigh?--a note infallible
 :Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot?
 :Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?
 :Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes
 :Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
 :That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?
S:
S:Why, then the world and all that's in 't is nothing,
 :
 :The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,
 :
 :My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,
 :
 :If this be nothing.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Good my lord, be cured
S:Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,
 :
 :For 'tis most dangerous.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Say it be, 'tis true.
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :No, no, my lord.
 :
S:LEONTES  It is. You lie, you lie.
 :
 :I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
 :
 :Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
 :
 :Or else a hovering temporizer that
S:Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
 :
 :Inclining to them both. Were my wife's liver
 :
 :Infected as her life, she would not live
 :
 :The running of one glass.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Who does infect her?
 :
 :LEONTES
 :Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging
S:
 :About his neck--Bohemia, who, if I
 :
 :Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
 :
 :To see alike mine honor as their profits,
 :
 :Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
 :Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou,
 :His cupbearer--whom I from meaner form
 :Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
 :Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven
S:
 :How I am galled--mightst bespice a cup
 :
 :To give mine enemy a lasting wink,
 :
 :Which draft to me were cordial.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Sir, my lord,
 :I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
 :But with a ling'ring dram that should not work
 :Maliciously like poison. But I cannot
S:
 :Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
 :
 :So sovereignly being honorable. I have loved thee--
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Make that thy question, and go rot!
 :
 :Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
 :
 :To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
 :The purity and whiteness of my sheets--
S:Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
 :
 :Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps--
 :
 :Give scandal to the blood o' th' Prince, my son,
 :
 :Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
S:Without ripe moving to 't? Would I do this?
 :
 :Could man so blench?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I must believe you, sir.
 :I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for 't--
 :Provided that, when he's removed, your Highness
S:Will take again your queen as yours at first,
 :
 :Even for your son's sake, and thereby for sealing
 :
 :The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
 :
 :Known and allied to yours.
 :
 :LEONTES  Thou dost advise me
 :Even so as I mine own course have set down.
 :I'll give no blemish to her honor, none.
 :
S:
 :CAMILLO  My lord,
 :
S:Go then, and with a countenance as clear
 :
 :As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
 :
 :And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.
 :
 :If from me he have wholesome beverage,
 :Account me not your servant.
 :
 :LEONTES  This is all.
 :Do 't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
 :Do 't not, thou splitt'st thine own.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I'll do 't, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :CAMILLO
S:
 :O miserable lady! But, for me,
 :
S:What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
 :
 :Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do 't
 :
S:Is the obedience to a master, one
 :
 :Who in rebellion with himself will have
 :
 :All that are his so too. To do this deed,
 :
 :Promotion follows. If I could find example
 :Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
 :And flourished after, I'd not do 't. But since
 :Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears not one,
 :Let villainy itself forswear 't. I must
S:Forsake the court. To do 't or no is certain
 :
 :To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!
 :
 :Here comes Bohemia.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Polixenes.]
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES, [aside]  This is strange. Methinks
 :My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?--
S:
 :Good day, Camillo.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Hail, most royal sir.
 :
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :
 :What is the news i' th' court?
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  None rare, my lord.
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :The King hath on him such a countenance
 :As he had lost some province and a region
S:
 :Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him
 :
S:With customary compliment, when he,
 :
 :Wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling
 :
 :A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and
 :
S:So leaves me to consider what is breeding
 :
 :That changes thus his manners.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I dare not know, my
 :lord.
 :
 :POLIXENES
S:How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not?
 :
 :Be intelligent to me--'tis thereabouts;
 :
 :For to yourself what you do know, you must,
 :
 :And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
 :Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
 :Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be
 :A party in this alteration, finding
 :Myself thus altered with 't.
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  There is a sickness
 :
 :Which puts some of us in distemper, but
 :
 :I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
 :Of you that yet are well.
 :
 :POLIXENES  How caught of me?
 :Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
 :I have looked on thousands who have sped the
S:
 :better
 :
 :By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo,
 :
 :As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
 :
 :Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns
 :Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
 :In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,
 :If you know aught which does behoove my
 :knowledge
S:
 :Thereof to be informed, imprison 't not
 :
S:In ignorant concealment.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I may not answer.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?
 :I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?
 :I conjure thee by all the parts of man
 :Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least
S:
 :Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
 :
S:What incidency thou dost guess of harm
 :
 :Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
 :
S:Which way to be prevented, if to be;
 :
 :If not, how best to bear it.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  Sir, I will tell you,
 :
 :Since I am charged in honor and by him
 :
 :That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,
 :Which must be e'en as swiftly followed as
 :I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
 :Cry lost, and so goodnight.
 :
 :POLIXENES  On, good Camillo.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :
 :I am appointed him to murder you.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :By whom, Camillo?
 :
S:CAMILLO  By the King.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  For what?
 :
 :
S:CAMILLO
 :
 :He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears,
 :
 :As he had seen 't or been an instrument
 :
 :To vice you to 't, that you have touched his queen
 :Forbiddenly.
 :
 :POLIXENES  O, then my best blood turn
 :To an infected jelly, and my name
 :Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
S:
 :Turn then my freshest reputation to
 :
S:A savor that may strike the dullest nostril
 :
 :Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,
 :
 :Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
 :
 :That e'er was heard or read.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Swear his thought over
 :By each particular star in heaven and
 :By all their influences, you may as well
 :Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
S:
 :As or by oath remove or counsel shake
 :
 :The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
 :
 :Is piled upon his faith and will continue
 :
 :The standing of his body.
 :
 :POLIXENES  How should this grow?
 :
 :CAMILLO
S:
 :I know not. But I am sure 'tis safer to
 :
 :Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
 :
 :If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
 :
 :That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
 :Shall bear along impawned, away tonight!
S:Your followers I will whisper to the business,
 :
 :And will by twos and threes at several posterns
 :
 :Clear them o' th' city. For myself, I'll put
 :
S:My fortunes to your service, which are here
 :
 :By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,
 :
 :For, by the honor of my parents, I
 :
 :Have uttered truth--which if you seek to prove,
 :I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
 :Than one condemned by the King's own mouth,
 :thereon
 :His execution sworn.
 :
S:
 :POLIXENES  I do believe thee.
 :
S:I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand.
 :
 :Be pilot to me and thy places shall
 :
 :Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and
 :
S:My people did expect my hence departure
 :
 :Two days ago. This jealousy
 :
 :Is for a precious creature. As she's rare,
 :
 :Must it be great; and as his person's mighty,
S:Must it be violent; and as he does conceive
 :
 :He is dishonored by a man which ever
 :
 :Professed to him, why, his revenges must
 :
 :In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me.
 :Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
 :The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
 :Of his ill-ta'en suspicion. Come, Camillo,
S:I will respect thee as a father if
 :
S:Thou bear'st my life off hence. Let us avoid.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :
 :It is in mine authority to command
 :The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness
 :To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Hermione, Mamillius, and Ladies.]
 :
 :
S:
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :Take the boy to you. He so troubles me
 :
 :'Tis past enduring.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST LADY  Come, my gracious lord,
 :
 :Shall I be your playfellow?
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :No, I'll none of you.
S:
 :
 :FIRST LADY  Why, my sweet lord?
 :
S:
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :
S:You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
 :
 :I were a baby still.--I love you better.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND LADY
 :
 :And why so, my lord?
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS  Not for because
 :Your brows are blacker--yet black brows, they say,
 :Become some women best, so that there be not
 :Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
S:Or a half-moon made with a pen.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LADY  Who taught this?
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :I learned it out of women's faces.--Pray now,
 :What color are your eyebrows?
 :
 :FIRST LADY  Blue, my lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :
 :Nay, that's a mock. I have seen a lady's nose
 :
 :That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
S:
 :
 :FIRST LADY  Hark ye,
 :
S:The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall
 :
 :Present our services to a fine new prince
 :
 :One of these days, and then you'd wanton with us
 :
 :If we would have you.
 :
 :SECOND LADY  She is spread of late
 :Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :What wisdom stirs amongst you?--Come, sir, now
 :
 :I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,
 :And tell 's a tale.
 :
 :MAMILLIUS  Merry or sad shall 't be?
 :
 :HERMIONE  As merry as you will.
S:
 :
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :
 :A sad tale's best for winter. I have one
 :
 :Of sprites and goblins.
 :
 :HERMIONE  Let's have that, good sir.
 :Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best
 :To fright me with your sprites. You're powerful at it.
S:
 :
 :
S:MAMILLIUS
 :
 :There was a man--
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  Nay, come sit down, then on.
 :
 :MAMILLIUS
 :Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,
 :Yond crickets shall not hear it.
 :
S:
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :Come on then, and give 't me in mine ear.
 :
 :
 :
 :[They talk privately.]
 :
 :[Enter Leontes, Antigonus, and Lords.]
 :
 :
S:
 :LEONTES
 :
S:Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :
 :Behind the tuft of pines I met them. Never
 :Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them
 :Even to their ships.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  How blest am I
 :
 :In my just censure, in my true opinion!
 :
 :Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed
 :In being so blest! There may be in the cup
 :A spider steeped, and one may drink, depart,
 :And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
S:Is not infected; but if one present
 :
 :Th' abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known
 :
 :How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
 :
 :With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
 :Camillo was his help in this, his pander.
 :There is a plot against my life, my crown.
 :All's true that is mistrusted. That false villain
 :Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.
 :He has discovered my design, and I
S:
S:Remain a pinched thing, yea, a very trick
 :
 :For them to play at will. How came the posterns
 :
 :So easily open?
 :
 :
S:LORD  By his great authority,
 :
 :Which often hath no less prevailed than so
 :
 :On your command.
 :
 :
S:LEONTES  I know 't too well.
 :
 :[To Hermione.] Give me the boy. I am glad you did
 :
 :not nurse him.
 :
 :Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
S:Have too much blood in him.
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  What is this? Sport?
 :
 :
 :LEONTES, [to the Ladies]
 :Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.
 :Away with him, and let her sport herself
 :With that she's big with, [(to Hermione)] for 'tis
S:Polixenes
 :
 :Has made thee swell thus.
 :
 :[A Lady exits with Mamillius.]
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  But I'd say he had not,
 :And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
 :Howe'er you lean to th' nayward.
 :
S:LEONTES  You, my lords,
 :
 :Look on her, mark her well. Be but about
 :
 :To say "She is a goodly lady," and
 :
 :The justice of your hearts will thereto add
S:"'Tis pity she's not honest, honorable."
 :
 :Praise her but for this her without-door form,
 :
 :Which on my faith deserves high speech, and
 :
 :straight
 :The shrug, the "hum," or "ha," these petty brands
 :That calumny doth use--O, I am out,
 :That mercy does, for calumny will sear
 :Virtue itself--these shrugs, these "hum"s and "ha"s,
 :When you have said she's goodly, come between
S:
 :Ere you can say she's honest. But be 't known,
 :
 :From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
 :
 :She's an adult'ress.
 :
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE  Should a villain say so,
 :
 :The most replenished villain in the world,
 :
 :He were as much more villain. You, my lord,
 :Do but mistake.
 :
S:LEONTES  You have mistook, my lady,
 :
 :Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,
 :
 :Which I'll not call a creature of thy place
 :
 :Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
 :Should a like language use to all degrees,
 :And mannerly distinguishment leave out
 :Betwixt the prince and beggar.--I have said
 :She's an adult'ress; I have said with whom.
 :More, she's a traitor, and Camillo is
S:
 :A federary with her, and one that knows
 :
S:What she should shame to know herself
 :
S:But with her most vile principal: that she's
 :
 :A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
 :
 :That vulgars give bold'st titles; ay, and privy
 :
 :To this their late escape.
 :
 :HERMIONE  No, by my life,
 :Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
 :When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
 :You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,
S:
 :You scarce can right me throughly then to say
 :
 :You did mistake.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  No. If I mistake
 :In those foundations which I build upon,
S:The center is not big enough to bear
 :
 :A schoolboy's top.--Away with her to prison.
 :
 :He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
 :
 :But that he speaks.
 :
S:HERMIONE  There's some ill planet reigns.
 :
 :I must be patient till the heavens look
 :
 :With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,
 :
 :I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
 :Commonly are, the want of which vain dew
 :Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have
S:That honorable grief lodged here which burns
 :
 :Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,
 :
 :With thoughts so qualified as your charities
 :
 :Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
 :The King's will be performed.
 :
S:LEONTES  Shall I be heard?
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :Who is 't that goes with me? Beseech your Highness
S:My women may be with me, for you see
 :
 :My plight requires it.--Do not weep, good fools;
 :
 :There is no cause. When you shall know your
 :
 :mistress
S:Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
 :
 :As I come out. This action I now go on
 :
 :Is for my better grace.--Adieu, my lord.
 :
 :I never wished to see you sorry; now
S:I trust I shall.--My women, come; you have leave.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Go, do our bidding. Hence!
 :
 :[Hermione exits, under guard, with her Ladies.]
 :
 :LORD
S:Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS
 :
 :Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
 :Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer:
 :Yourself, your queen, your son.
 :
 :LORD  For her, my lord,
 :I dare my life lay down--and will do 't, sir,
S:
 :Please you t' accept it--that the Queen is spotless
 :
S:I' th' eyes of heaven, and to you--I mean
 :
 :In this which you accuse her.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  If it prove
 :
 :She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
 :
 :I lodge my wife. I'll go in couples with her;
 :Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her.
 :For every inch of woman in the world,
 :Ay, every dram of woman's flesh, is false,
 :If she be.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Hold your peaces.
 :
S:
 :
 :LORD  Good my lord--
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTIGONUS
 :
 :It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.
 :
 :You are abused, and by some putter-on
 :
 :That will be damned for 't. Would I knew the
 :villain!
S:I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flawed,
 :
 :I have three daughters--the eldest is eleven;
 :
 :The second and the third, nine and some five;
 :
 :If this prove true, they'll pay for 't. By mine honor,
 :I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see
 :To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,
 :And I had rather glib myself than they
 :Should not produce fair issue.
 :
S:
 :LEONTES  Cease. No more.
 :
 :You smell this business with a sense as cold
 :
 :As is a dead man's nose. But I do see 't and feel 't,
 :
S:As you feel doing thus, and see withal
 :
 :The instruments that feel.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  If it be so,
S:We need no grave to bury honesty.
 :
 :There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
 :
 :Of the whole dungy Earth.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  What? Lack I credit?
 :
 :LORD
 :I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
 :Upon this ground. And more it would content me
S:
 :To have her honor true than your suspicion,
 :
 :Be blamed for 't how you might.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Why, what need we
 :Commune with you of this, but rather follow
S:Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
 :
 :Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
 :
S:Imparts this, which if you--or stupefied
 :
 :Or seeming so in skill--cannot or will not
 :
 :Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
 :
 :We need no more of your advice. The matter,
 :The loss, the gain, the ord'ring on 't is all
 :Properly ours.
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  And I wish, my liege,
 :You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
S:
 :Without more overture.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  How could that be?
 :
 :Either thou art most ignorant by age,
 :Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
 :Added to their familiarity--
 :Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,
S:That lacked sight only, naught for approbation
 :
 :But only seeing, all other circumstances
 :
 :Made up to th' deed--doth push on this
 :
 :proceeding.
 :Yet, for a greater confirmation--
S:For in an act of this importance 'twere
 :
 :Most piteous to be wild--I have dispatched in post
 :
 :To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
 :
 :Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
 :Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle
 :They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had
 :Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
S:
 :
S:LORD  Well done,
 :
 :my lord.
 :
 :
 :
S:LEONTES
 :
 :Though I am satisfied and need no more
 :
 :Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
 :
 :Give rest to th' minds of others, such as he
S:Whose ignorant credulity will not
 :
 :Come up to th' truth. So have we thought it good
 :
 :From our free person she should be confined,
 :
 :Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
S:Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.
 :
 :We are to speak in public, for this business
 :
 :Will raise us all.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIGONUS, [aside]  To laughter, as I take it,
 :
 :If the good truth were known.

S:Becomes a woman best. I'll take 't upon me.

 :If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister
 :
S:And never to my red-looked anger be
 :
 :The trumpet anymore. Pray you, Emilia,
 :
 :Commend my best obedience to the Queen.
 :

 :Who but today hammered of this design,

 :Scene 3
 :=======
 :[Enter Leontes.]
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness
 :
S:To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If
 :
 :The cause were not in being--part o' th' cause,
 :
S:She th' adult'ress, for the harlot king
 :
 :Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
 :
S:And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she
 :
 :I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,
 :
 :Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
 :
 :Might come to me again.--Who's there?
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  My lord.
 :
 :LEONTES  How does the boy?
 :
 :SERVANT  He took good rest tonight. 'Tis hoped
S:
 :His sickness is discharged.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  To see his nobleness,
 :
S:Conceiving the dishonor of his mother.
 :
S:He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,
 :
 :Fastened and fixed the shame on 't in himself,
 :
 :Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
 :
S:And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,
 :
 :See how he fares.	[Servant exits.]
 :
 :Fie, fie, no thought of him.
 :
 :The very thought of my revenges that way
 :Recoil upon me--in himself too mighty,
 :And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be
 :Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,
 :Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
 :Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.
S:
 :They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
 :
 :Shall she within my power.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Paulina, carrying the baby, with Servants,
 :Antigonus, and Lords.]
 :
 :
 :LORD  You must not enter.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
 :
S:Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.
 :
 :Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
 :
 :Than the Queen's life? A gracious innocent soul,
 :
 :More free than he is jealous.
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  That's enough.
 :
 :SERVANT
 :Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded
S:
 :None should come at him.
 :
S:
 :
 :PAULINA  Not so hot, good sir.
 :
 :I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you
 :
 :That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
 :At each his needless heavings, such as you
 :Nourish the cause of his awaking. I
 :Do come with words as medicinal as true,
S:Honest as either, to purge him of that humor
 :
 :That presses him from sleep.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  What noise there, ho?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
 :No noise, my lord, but needful conference
 :About some gossips for your Highness.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  How?--
 :
 :Away with that audacious lady. Antigonus,
 :
S:I charged thee that she should not come about me.
 :
S:I knew she would.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  I told her so, my lord,
 :
 :On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
 :She should not visit you.
 :
 :LEONTES  What, canst not rule her?
 :
S:PAULINA
 :
 :From all dishonesty he can. In this,
 :
 :Unless he take the course that you have done--
 :
 :Commit me for committing honor--trust it,
 :He shall not rule me.
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  La you now, you hear.
 :When she will take the rein I let her run,
 :But she'll not stumble.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Good my liege, I come--
 :
 :And I beseech you hear me, who professes
 :
S:Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
 :
 :Your most obedient counselor, yet that dares
 :
 :Less appear so in comforting your evils
 :
 :Than such as most seem yours--I say I come
 :From your good queen.
 :
 :LEONTES  Good queen?
 :
 :PAULINA
S:
 :Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say "good
 :
 :queen,"
 :
 :And would by combat make her good, so were I
 :
S:A man, the worst about you.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Force her hence.
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
S:Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
 :
 :First hand me. On mine own accord I'll off,
 :
 :But first I'll do my errand.--The good queen,
 :
S:For she is good, hath brought you forth a
 :
 :daughter--
 :
 :Here 'tis--commends it to your blessing.
 :
 :[She lays down the baby.]
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Out!
 :
 :A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door.
 :
 :A most intelligencing bawd.
 :
 :PAULINA  Not so.
 :I am as ignorant in that as you
 :In so entitling me, and no less honest
 :Than you are mad--which is enough, I'll warrant,
S:
 :As this world goes, to pass for honest.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Traitors,
 :
 :Will you not push her out? [To Antigonus.] Give her
 :the bastard,
 :Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted
 :By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,
S:Take 't up, I say. Give 't to thy crone.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA, [to Antigonus]  Forever
 :
 :Unvenerable be thy hands if thou
 :Tak'st up the Princess by that forced baseness
S:Which he has put upon 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  He dreads his wife.
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
 :So I would you did. Then 'twere past all doubt
S:You'd call your children yours.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  A nest of traitors!
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS
 :I am none, by this good light.
 :
 :PAULINA  Nor I, nor any
 :But one that's here, and that's himself. For he
S:
S:The sacred honor of himself, his queen's,
 :
 :His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
 :
 :Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; and will
 :
 :not--
 :For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
 :He cannot be compelled to 't--once remove
 :The root of his opinion, which is rotten
 :As ever oak or stone was sound.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  A callet
 :
 :Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her
 :
 :husband
 :And now baits me! This brat is none of mine.
 :It is the issue of Polixenes.
 :Hence with it, and together with the dam
 :Commit them to the fire.
 :
S:
 :PAULINA  It is yours,
 :
 :And, might we lay th' old proverb to your charge,
 :
 :So like you 'tis the worse.--Behold, my lords,
 :
 :Although the print be little, the whole matter
 :And copy of the father--eye, nose, lip,
 :The trick of 's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
 :The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his
S:smiles,
 :
 :The very mold and frame of hand, nail, finger.
 :
 :And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
 :
 :So like to him that got it, if thou hast
 :The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colors
 :No yellow in 't, lest she suspect, as he does,
S:Her children not her husband's.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  A gross hag!--
 :
 :And, losel, thou art worthy to be hanged
S:That wilt not stay her tongue.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTIGONUS  Hang all the husbands
 :
 :That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
 :
 :Hardly one subject.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Once more, take her hence.
 :
 :PAULINA
 :A most unworthy and unnatural lord
S:Can do no more.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  I'll ha' thee burnt.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAULINA  I care not.
 :
 :It is an heretic that makes the fire,
 :
 :Not she which burns in 't. I'll not call you tyrant;
 :
 :But this most cruel usage of your queen,
 :Not able to produce more accusation
 :Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something
 :savors
 :Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,
 :Yea, scandalous to the world.
S:
 :
 :
 :LEONTES, [to Antigonus]  On your allegiance,
 :
 :Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
 :
S:Where were her life? She durst not call me so
 :
 :If she did know me one. Away with her!
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA, [to Lords]
 :I pray you do not push me; I'll be gone.--
S:Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours. Jove send her
 :
 :A better guiding spirit.--What needs these hands?
 :
 :You that are thus so tender o'er his follies
 :
 :Will never do him good, not one of you.
 :So, so. Farewell, we are gone.	[She exits.]
 :
 :LEONTES, [to Antigonus]
S:Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
 :
 :My child? Away with 't! Even thou, that hast
 :
 :A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
 :
 :And see it instantly consumed with fire.
 :Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.
 :Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
 :And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
 :With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
 :And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so.
S:
 :The bastard brains with these my proper hands
 :
 :Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,
 :
 :For thou sett'st on thy wife.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  I did not, sir.
 :
 :These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
 :
 :Can clear me in 't.
 :
 :LORDS  We can, my royal liege.
 :He is not guilty of her coming hither.
 :
 :LEONTES  You're liars all.
S:
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :
 :Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.
 :
 :We have always truly served you, and beseech
 :So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,
 :As recompense of our dear services
 :Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
 :Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
S:
 :Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :I am a feather for each wind that blows.
 :Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
 :And call me father? Better burn it now
 :Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
 :It shall not neither. [To Antigonus.] You, sir, come
S:
 :you hither,
 :
 :You that have been so tenderly officious
 :
S:With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
 :
 :To save this bastard's life--for 'tis a bastard,
 :
 :So sure as this beard's gray. What will you
 :
 :adventure
 :To save this brat's life?
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  Anything, my lord,
 :That my ability may undergo
 :And nobleness impose. At least thus much:
S:
S:I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
 :
 :To save the innocent. Anything possible.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
 :Thou wilt perform my bidding.
 :
 :ANTIGONUS, [his hand on the hilt]  I will, my lord.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :Mark, and perform it, seest thou; for the fail
 :
 :Of any point in 't shall not only be
 :Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
 :Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
 :As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry
 :This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it
 :To some remote and desert place quite out
S:
 :Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
 :
 :Without more mercy, to it own protection
 :
 :And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune
 :
 :It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
 :On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
 :That thou commend it strangely to some place
 :Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
S:
 :
 :ANTIGONUS
 :
 :I swear to do this, though a present death
 :
 :Had been more merciful.--Come on, poor babe.
 :[He picks up the baby.]
 :Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
S:To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,
 :
 :Casting their savageness aside, have done
 :
 :Like offices of pity. [To Leontes.] Sir, be prosperous
 :
 :In more than this deed does require.--And blessing
 :Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
 :Poor thing, condemned to loss.
S:[He exits, carrying the baby.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  No, I'll not rear
 :
 :Another's issue.
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  Please your Highness, posts
 :From those you sent to th' oracle are come
 :An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,
 :Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
 :Hasting to th' court.
S:
 :
 :
 :LORD, [to Leontes]  So please you, sir, their speed
 :
 :Hath been beyond account.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Twenty-three days
S:They have been absent. 'Tis good speed, foretells
 :
 :The great Apollo suddenly will have
 :
 :The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.
 :
 :Summon a session, that we may arraign
 :Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath
 :Been publicly accused, so shall she have
S:A just and open trial. While she lives,
 :
 :My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,

 :Silence!
 :
S:LEONTES  Read the indictment.
 :
 :
 :
 :OFFICER [reads]  Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes,
 :
 :King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned
 :of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,
 :King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo
 :to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy
 :royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances
S:partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to
 :
S:the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel
 :
 :and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by
 :
 :night.
 :
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE
 :
 :Since what I am to say must be but that
 :
 :Which contradicts my accusation, and
 :The testimony on my part no other
 :But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
 :To say "Not guilty." Mine integrity,
 :Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
S:Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
 :
 :Behold our human actions, as they do,
 :
 :I doubt not then but innocence shall make
 :
 :False accusation blush and tyranny
 :Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
 :Whom least will seem to do so, my past life
 :Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
 :As I am now unhappy; which is more
S:Than history can pattern, though devised
 :
 :And played to take spectators. For behold me,
 :
 :A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
 :
 :A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
S:The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
 :
 :To prate and talk for life and honor fore
 :
 :Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
 :
 :As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor,
 :'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
 :And only that I stand for. I appeal
 :To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
 :Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
 :How merited to be so; since he came,
S:
 :With what encounter so uncurrent I
 :
 :Have strained t' appear thus; if one jot beyond
 :
S:The bound of honor, or in act or will
 :
 :That way inclining, hardened be the hearts
 :
 :Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
 :
 :Cry fie upon my grave.
 :
S:LEONTES  I ne'er heard yet
 :
 :That any of these bolder vices wanted
 :
 :Less impudence to gainsay what they did
 :
 :Than to perform it first.
 :
S:HERMIONE  That's true enough,
 :
 :Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :You will not own it.
 :
 :HERMIONE  More than mistress of
S:Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
 :
 :At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
 :
 :With whom I am accused, I do confess
 :
 :I loved him as in honor he required,
 :With such a kind of love as might become
 :A lady like me, with a love even such,
 :So and no other, as yourself commanded,
 :Which not to have done, I think, had been in me
S:Both disobedience and ingratitude
 :
 :To you and toward your friend, whose love had
 :
 :spoke,
 :
 :Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
S:That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
 :
 :I know not how it tastes, though it be dished
 :
 :For me to try how. All I know of it
 :
 :Is that Camillo was an honest man;
 :And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
 :Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
 :
 :LEONTES
 :You knew of his departure, as you know
S:
 :What you have underta'en to do in 's absence.
 :
 :
 :
 :HERMIONE  Sir,
 :
 :You speak a language that I understand not.
 :My life stands in the level of your dreams,
 :Which I'll lay down.
 :
 :LEONTES  Your actions are my dreams.
S:
 :You had a bastard by Polixenes,
 :
S:And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame--
 :
 :Those of your fact are so--so past all truth,
 :
S:Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
 :
 :Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
 :
 :No father owning it--which is indeed
 :
 :More criminal in thee than it--so thou
 :Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
 :Look for no less than death.
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE  Sir, spare your threats.
 :
 :The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
 :
 :To me can life be no commodity.
 :The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
 :I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,
 :But know not how it went. My second joy
 :And first fruits of my body, from his presence
 :I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,
S:
 :Starred most unluckily, is from my breast,
 :
S:The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth,
 :
 :Haled out to murder; myself on every post
 :
 :Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred
 :
 :The childbed privilege denied, which longs
 :To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
 :Here to this place, i' th' open air, before
 :I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
 :Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
 :That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
S:
 :But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life,
 :
 :I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,
 :
 :Which I would free), if I shall be condemned
 :
S:Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
 :
 :But what your jealousies awake, I tell you

 :'Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all,

S:I do refer me to the oracle.

S:Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.

S:The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.

S:

 :This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down

 :Some remedies for life.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Paulina exits with Officers carrying Hermione.]
 :
 :Apollo, pardon
 :My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle.
 :I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
S:New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
 :
 :Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
 :
 :For, being transported by my jealousies
 :
 :To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
 :Camillo for the minister to poison
 :My friend Polixenes, which had been done
 :But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
 :My swift command, though I with death and with
 :Reward did threaten and encourage him,
S:
 :Not doing it and being done. He, most humane
 :
 :And filled with honor, to my kingly guest
 :
 :Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,
 :
S:Which you knew great, and to the hazard
 :
 :Of all incertainties himself commended,
 :
 :No richer than his honor. How he glisters
 :
 :Through my rust, and how his piety
 :Does my deeds make the blacker!
 :
 :[Enter Paulina.]
 :
 :
S:
 :PAULINA  Woe the while!
 :
 :O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
 :
 :Break too!
 :
 :
 :LORD  What fit is this, good lady?
S:
 :
 :PAULINA, [to Leontes]
 :
 :What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
 :
 :What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling
 :In leads or oils? What old or newer torture
 :Must I receive, whose every word deserves
 :To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,
 :Together working with thy jealousies,
 :Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
S:
 :For girls of nine, O, think what they have done,
 :
 :And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all
 :
 :Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.
 :
 :That thou betrayedst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
 :That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant
S:And damnable ingrateful. Nor was 't much
 :
 :Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo's honor,
 :
 :To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
 :
 :More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon
 :The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
 :To be or none or little, though a devil
S:Would have shed water out of fire ere done 't.
 :
 :Nor is 't directly laid to thee the death
 :
 :Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,
 :
S:Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
 :
 :That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
 :
 :Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no,
 :
S:Laid to thy answer. But the last--O lords,
 :
 :When I have said, cry woe!--the Queen, the Queen,
 :
 :The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance
 :
 :for 't
S:Not dropped down yet.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD  The higher powers forbid!
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
 :I say she's dead. I'll swear 't. If word nor oath
 :Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring
S:Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,
 :
 :Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
 :
 :As I would do the gods.--But, O thou tyrant,
 :
 :Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
 :Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee
 :To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
 :Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
 :Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
 :In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
S:
 :To look that way thou wert.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Go on, go on.
 :
 :Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved
 :All tongues to talk their bitt'rest.
S:
 :
 :LORD, [to Paulina]  Say no more.
 :
 :Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
 :
S:I' th' boldness of your speech.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  I am sorry for 't.
 :
 :All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
 :I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much
 :The rashness of a woman. He is touched
S:To th' noble heart.--What's gone and what's past
 :
 :help
 :
 :Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction
 :
 :At my petition. I beseech you, rather
 :Let me be punished, that have minded you
 :Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
 :Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.
 :The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
 :I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children.
S:
 :I'll not remember you of my own lord,
 :
S:Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,
 :
 :And I'll say nothing.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Thou didst speak but well
 :When most the truth, which I receive much better
 :Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
 :To the dead bodies of my queen and son.
 :One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall
 :The causes of their death appear, unto
S:
 :Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
 :
 :The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
 :
 :Shall be my recreation. So long as nature
 :
 :Will bear up with this exercise, so long
 :I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me
 :To these sorrows.

 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Antigonus carrying the babe, and a Mariner.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS
 :
 :Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon
S:The deserts of Bohemia?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINER  Ay, my lord, and fear
 :
 :We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly
 :And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
 :The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
 :And frown upon 's.
 :
 :ANTIGONUS
S:
 :Their sacred wills be done. Go, get aboard.
 :
 :Look to thy bark. I'll not be long before
 :
S:I call upon thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARINER  Make your best haste, and go not
 :
 :Too far i' th' land. 'Tis like to be loud weather.
 :Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
S:Of prey that keep upon 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  Go thou away.
 :
 :I'll follow instantly.
S:
 :
 :MARINER  I am glad at heart
 :
S:To be so rid o' th' business.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTIGONUS  Come, poor babe.
 :
 :I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' th' dead
S:May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother
 :
 :Appeared to me last night, for ne'er was dream
 :
 :So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
 :
 :Sometimes her head on one side, some another.
 :I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
 :So filled and so becoming. In pure white robes,
 :Like very sanctity, she did approach
 :My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,
 :And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
S:
 :Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon
 :
 :Did this break from her: "Good Antigonus,
 :
 :Since fate, against thy better disposition,
 :
 :Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
 :Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
 :Places remote enough are in Bohemia.
 :There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe
 :Is counted lost forever, Perdita
S:
 :I prithee call 't. For this ungentle business
 :
 :Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
 :
 :Thy wife Paulina more." And so, with shrieks,
 :
 :She melted into air. Affrighted much,
 :I did in time collect myself and thought
 :This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys,
 :Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
 :I will be squared by this. I do believe
S:
 :Hermione hath suffered death, and that
 :
 :Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
 :
 :Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
 :
 :Either for life or death, upon the earth
 :Of its right father.--Blossom, speed thee well.
 :There lie, and there thy character; there these,
 :[He lays down the baby, a bundle, and a box.]
 :Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
S:
 :And still rest thine. [Thunder.] The storm begins.
 :
 :Poor wretch,
 :
 :That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
 :
 :To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,
 :But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I
S:To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.
 :
 :The day frowns more and more. Thou 'rt like to have
 :
 :A lullaby too rough. I never saw
 :
 :The heavens so dim by day.
 :[Thunder, and sounds of hunting.]
 :A savage clamor!
 :Well may I get aboard! This is the chase.
 :I am gone forever!	[He exits, pursued by a bear.]
S:
 :
 :[Enter Shepherd.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  I would there were no age between ten and
 :three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
 :rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting
 :wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,
 :fighting--Hark you now. Would any but these
S:
 :boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt
 :
 :this weather? They have scared away two of my best
 :
 :sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than
 :
 :the master. If anywhere I have them, 'tis by the
 :seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an 't be thy will,
S:what have we here? Mercy on 's, a bairn! A very
 :
 :pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty
 :
 :one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I
 :
 :am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman
 :in the scape. This has been some stair-work,
 :some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They
 :were warmer that got this than the poor thing is
 :here. I'll take it up for pity. Yet I'll tarry till my son
 :come. He halloed but even now.--Whoa-ho-ho!
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Shepherd's Son.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  Hilloa, loa!
 :
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD  What, art so near? If thou 'lt see a thing to
 :
 :talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.
 :
 :What ail'st thou, man?
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  I have seen two such sights, by sea
 :and by land--but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is
 :now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it, you
 :cannot thrust a bodkin's point.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Why, boy, how is it?
 :
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  I would you did but see how it chafes,
 :
 :how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that's
 :
 :not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor
 :
 :souls! Sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em.
S:Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast,
 :
 :and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you'd
 :
S:thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land
 :
 :service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone,
 :
 :how he cried to me for help, and said his
 :
 :name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
 :end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it.
 :But, first, how the poor souls roared and the sea
 :mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared
 :and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
 :the sea or weather.
S:
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD  Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Now, now. I have not winked since I
 :
 :saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under
 :water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman.
 :He's at it now.
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Would I had been by to have helped the old
S:man.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  I would you had been by the ship side,
 :
 :to have helped her. There your charity would have
S:lacked footing.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look
 :
 :thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met'st with
S:things dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight
 :
 :for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire's
 :
 :child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open
 :
 :'t. So, let's see. It was told me I should be rich by
 :the fairies. This is some changeling. Open 't. What's
 :within, boy?
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [opening the box]   You're a made old
 :man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,
S:
S:you're well to live. Gold, all gold.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so.
 :
S:Up with 't, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.
 :
 :We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires
 :
 :nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good
 :
 :boy, the next way home.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Go you the next way with your
 :findings. I'll go see if the bear be gone from the
 :gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are
 :never curst but when they are hungry. If there be
S:
 :any of him left, I'll bury it.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern
 :
 :by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to
 :th' sight of him.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Marry, will I, and you shall help to
 :put him i' th' ground.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good
 :
 :deeds on 't.

S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Polixenes and Camillo.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more
 :importunate. 'Tis a sickness denying thee anything,
 :a death to grant this.
 :
S:CAMILLO  It is fifteen years since I saw my country.
 :
 :Though I have for the most part been aired abroad,
 :
 :I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
 :
 :king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling
S:sorrows I might be some allay--or I o'erween to
 :
 :think so--which is another spur to my departure.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  As thou lov'st me, Camillo, wipe not out the
S:rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I
 :
 :have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better
 :
S:not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou,
 :
 :having made me businesses which none without
 :
 :thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to
 :
 :execute them thyself or take away with thee the very
 :services thou hast done, which if I have not enough
 :considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
 :thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
 :therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country
 :Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very
S:
 :naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
 :
 :penitent, as thou call'st him, and reconciled king
 :
 :my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen
 :
 :and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
 :Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my
S:son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
 :
 :being gracious, than they are in losing them when
 :
 :they have approved their virtues.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.
 :What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown,
 :but I have missingly noted he is of late
 :much retired from court and is less frequent to his
 :princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
S:
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  I have considered so much, Camillo, and
 :
 :with some care, so far that I have eyes under my
 :
 :service which look upon his removedness, from
 :whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom
 :from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man,
 :they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the
 :imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an
S:
 :unspeakable estate.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
 :
 :daughter of most rare note. The report of her is
 :extended more than can be thought to begin from
 :such a cottage.
 :
 :POLIXENES  That's likewise part of my intelligence, but,
S:
 :I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
 :
 :shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not
 :
 :appearing what we are, have some question with
 :
 :the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not
 :uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
 :Prithee be my present partner in this business, and
 :lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
S:

 :CAMILLO  I willingly obey your command.

 :ourselves.

S:Then my account I well may give,

S:

 :My traffic is sheets. When the kite builds, look to

 :lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus, who,
 :
S:being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
 :
 :a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
 :
 :drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is

 :feast? [(He reads a paper.)] Three pound of sugar,
 :five pound of currants, rice--what will this sister of
 :mine do with rice? But my father hath made her
 :mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath
S:
 :made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers,
 :
S:three-man song men all, and very good ones;
 :
 :but they are most of them means and basses, but
 :
S:one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
 :
 :hornpipes. I must have saffron to color the warden
 :
 :pies; mace; dates, none, that's out of my note;

S:

 :more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off.
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS  O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends
 :
 :me more than the stripes I have received, which are
 :
 :mighty ones and millions.
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Alas, poor man, a million of beating
 :may come to a great matter.

 :AUTOLYCUS  I am robbed, sir, and beaten, my money

 :
S:

 :SHEPHERD'S SON  What, by a horseman, or a footman?
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Indeed, he should be a footman by

 :SHEPHERD'S SON  How now? Canst stand?
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS, [stealing the Shepherd's Son's purse]  Softly,
 :dear sir, good sir, softly. You ha' done me a charitable
S:office.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Dost lack any money? I have a little
 :
S:money for thee.
 :
S:
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  No, good sweet sir, no, I beseech you, sir. I
 :
 :have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile
 :
S:hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there have
 :
S:money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I
 :
 :pray you; that kills my heart.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  What manner of fellow was he that
 :robbed you?
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about
 :with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of
 :the Prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
S:
 :virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of
 :
 :the court.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  His vices, you would say. There's no
 :virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to
 :make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man
S:
 :well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a
 :
 :process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion
 :
 :of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's wife
 :
 :within a mile where my land and living lies, and,
 :having flown over many knavish professions, he
 :settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig!
S:
 :He haunts wakes, fairs, and bearbaitings.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Very true, sir: he, sir, he. That's the rogue
 :
 :that put me into this apparel.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Not a more cowardly rogue in all
 :Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him,
 :he'd have run.
S:
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I
 :
S:am false of heart that way, and that he knew, I
 :
 :warrant him.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  How do you now?
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Sweet sir, much better than I was. I can
 :stand and walk. I will even take my leave of you and
 :pace softly towards my kinsman's.
 :
S:
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  Shall I bring thee on the way?
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  No, good-faced sir, no, sweet sir.
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Then fare thee well. I must go buy
 :spices for our sheep-shearing.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Prosper you, sweet sir.
 :[Shepherd's Son exits.]
S:
S:Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your
 :
 :spice. I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too. If
 :
 :I make not this cheat bring out another, and the
 :
S:shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my
 :
 :name put in the book of virtue.
 :
 :[Sings.]	Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,
 :
 :And merrily hent the stile-a.
 :A merry heart goes all the day,
 :Your sad tires in a mile-a.
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 4
S:
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Florizell and Perdita.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL
 :These your unusual weeds to each part of you
 :Does give a life--no shepherdess, but Flora
 :Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
S:
 :Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
 :
 :And you the queen on 't.
 :
S:
 :
S:PERDITA  Sir, my gracious lord,
 :
 :To chide at your extremes it not becomes me;
 :
 :O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,
 :
 :The gracious mark o' th' land, you have obscured
S:With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
 :
 :Most goddesslike pranked up. But that our feasts
 :
 :In every mess have folly, and the feeders
 :
 :Digest it with a custom, I should blush
 :To see you so attired, swoon, I think,
 :To show myself a glass.
 :
S:FLORIZELL  I bless the time
 :
 :When my good falcon made her flight across
 :
 :Thy father's ground.
 :
S:
 :
 :PERDITA  Now Jove afford you cause.
 :
S:To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness
 :
 :Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
 :
 :To think your father by some accident
 :
 :Should pass this way as you did. O the Fates,
S:How would he look to see his work, so noble,
 :
 :Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
 :
S:Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts, behold
 :
 :The sternness of his presence?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Apprehend
 :Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
 :Humbling their deities to love, have taken
S:The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter
 :
 :Became a bull, and bellowed; the green Neptune
 :
 :A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
 :
 :Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
 :As I seem now. Their transformations
 :Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
 :Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
 :Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts
S:Burn hotter than my faith.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  O, but sir,
 :
 :Your resolution cannot hold when 'tis
 :Opposed, as it must be, by th' power of the King.
 :One of these two must be necessities,
 :Which then will speak: that you must change this
 :purpose
S:Or I my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Thou dear'st Perdita,
 :
 :With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not
 :The mirth o' th' feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
 :Or not my father's. For I cannot be
 :Mine own, nor anything to any, if
 :I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
S:Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.
 :
S:Strangle such thoughts as these with anything
 :
S:That you behold the while. Your guests are coming.
 :
 :Lift up your countenance as it were the day
 :
 :Of celebration of that nuptial which
 :
 :We two have sworn shall come.
S:
 :
S:PERDITA  O Lady Fortune,
 :
 :Stand you auspicious!
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  See, your guests approach.
 :Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
S:And let's be red with mirth.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Shepherd, Shepherd's Son, Mopsa, Dorcas,
 :
 :Shepherds and Shepherdesses, Servants, Musicians,
 :and Polixenes and Camillo in disguise.]
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :Fie, daughter, when my old wife lived, upon
S:
 :This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
 :
 :Both dame and servant; welcomed all; served all;
 :
 :Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here
 :
S:At upper end o' th' table, now i' th' middle;
 :
 :On his shoulder, and his; her face afire
 :
 :With labor, and the thing she took to quench it
 :
 :She would to each one sip. You are retired
 :As if you were a feasted one and not
S:The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid
 :
 :These unknown friends to 's welcome, for it is
 :
 :A way to make us better friends, more known.
 :
S:Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
 :
 :That which you are, mistress o' th' feast. Come on,
 :
 :And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
 :
 :As your good flock shall prosper.
 :
 :PERDITA, [to Polixenes]  Sir, welcome.
 :It is my father's will I should take on me
 :The hostess-ship o' th' day. [To Camillo.] You're
 :welcome, sir.--
S:
 :Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.--Reverend
 :
 :sirs,
 :
 :For you there's rosemary and rue. These keep
 :
 :Seeming and savor all the winter long.
 :Grace and remembrance be to you both,
 :And welcome to our shearing.
 :
 :POLIXENES  Shepherdess--
S:
 :A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
 :
S:With flowers of winter.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  Sir, the year growing ancient,
 :
 :Not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
 :Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o' th' season
 :Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors,
S:Which some call nature's bastards. Of that kind
 :
 :Our rustic garden's barren, and I care not
 :
 :To get slips of them.
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES  Wherefore, gentle maiden,
 :
 :Do you neglect them?
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  For I have heard it said
 :There is an art which in their piedness shares
 :With great creating nature.
 :
 :POLIXENES  Say there be;
 :Yet nature is made better by no mean
S:
 :But nature makes that mean. So, over that art
 :
 :Which you say adds to nature is an art
 :
 :That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
 :
S:A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
 :
 :And make conceive a bark of baser kind
 :
 :By bud of nobler race. This is an art
 :
 :Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
 :The art itself is nature.
 :
S:PERDITA  So it is.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :
 :Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
 :And do not call them bastards.
 :
 :PERDITA  I'll not put
 :The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,
 :No more than, were I painted, I would wish
S:
 :This youth should say 'twere well, and only
 :
 :therefore
 :
 :Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you:
 :
 :Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,
 :The marigold, that goes to bed wi' th' sun
S:And with him rises weeping. These are flowers
 :
 :Of middle summer, and I think they are given
 :
 :To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
 :
 :
S:CAMILLO
 :
 :I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
 :
 :And only live by gazing.
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  Out, alas!
 :You'd be so lean that blasts of January
 :Would blow you through and through. [(To
 :Florizell.)] Now, my fair'st friend,
 :I would I had some flowers o' th' spring, that might
S:
S:Become your time of day, [(to the Shepherdesses)]
 :
 :and yours, and yours,
 :
 :That wear upon your virgin branches yet
 :
 :Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,
 :For the flowers now that, frighted, thou let'st fall
 :From Dis's wagon! Daffodils,
 :That come before the swallow dares, and take
S:The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
 :
 :But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
 :
 :Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
 :
 :That die unmarried ere they can behold
 :Bright Phoebus in his strength--a malady
 :Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
 :The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
 :The flower-de-luce being one--O, these I lack
S:To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
 :
 :To strew him o'er and o'er.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  What, like a corse?
 :
 :PERDITA
 :No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,
 :Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
 :But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your
S:
 :flowers.
 :
 :Methinks I play as I have seen them do
 :
 :In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine
 :
 :Does change my disposition.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  What you do
 :Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
S:I'd have you do it ever. When you sing,
 :
 :I'd have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
 :
 :Pray so; and for the ord'ring your affairs,
 :
 :To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you
 :A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
 :Nothing but that, move still, still so,
 :And own no other function. Each your doing,
 :So singular in each particular,
 :Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,
S:
 :That all your acts are queens.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  O Doricles,
 :
 :Your praises are too large. But that your youth
 :And the true blood which peeps fairly through 't
 :Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,
 :With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
S:You wooed me the false way.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  I think you have
 :
 :As little skill to fear as I have purpose
S:To put you to 't. But come, our dance, I pray.
 :
 :Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair
 :
 :That never mean to part.
 :
S:
 :
S:PERDITA  I'll swear for 'em.
 :
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES, [to Camillo]
 :
 :This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
 :
 :Ran on the greensward. Nothing she does or seems
 :
 :But smacks of something greater than herself,
 :Too noble for this place.
 :
S:CAMILLO  He tells her something
 :
 :That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is
 :
 :The queen of curds and cream.
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Musicians]  Come on, strike up.
 :
 :DORCAS
 :Mopsa must be your mistress? Marry, garlic
 :To mend her kissing with.
S:
 :
 :
 :MOPSA  Now, in good time!
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON
 :Not a word, a word. We stand upon our manners.--
S:Come, strike up. [Music begins.]
 :
 :[Here a Dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses.]
 :
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :
 :Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
 :
 :Which dances with your daughter?
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :They call him Doricles, and boasts himself
 :To have a worthy feeding. But I have it
 :Upon his own report, and I believe it.
S:
 :He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.
 :
 :I think so too, for never gazed the moon
 :
 :Upon the water as he'll stand and read,
 :
 :As 'twere, my daughter's eyes. And, to be plain,
S:I think there is not half a kiss to choose
 :
 :Who loves another best.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  She dances featly.
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :So she does anything, though I report it
S:That should be silent. If young Doricles
 :
 :Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
 :
 :Which he not dreams of.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  O, master, if you did but hear the peddler at
 :the door, you would never dance again after a tabor
 :and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He
 :sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money. He
 :utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
S:
S:ears grew to his tunes.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  He could never come better. He shall
 :
 :come in. I love a ballad but even too well if it be
 :doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant
 :thing indeed and sung lamentably.
 :
 :SERVANT  He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes.
 :No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He
S:
 :has the prettiest love songs for maids, so without
 :
 :bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate burdens
 :
 :of dildos and fadings, "Jump her and thump
 :
 :her." And where some stretch-mouthed rascal
 :would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul
 :gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer
 :"Whoop, do me no harm, good man"; puts him off,
 :slights him, with "Whoop, do me no harm, good
S:
 :man."
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  This is a brave fellow.
 :
S:
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable
 :
 :conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided
 :
S:wares?
 :
S:
 :
 :SERVANT  He hath ribbons of all the colors i' th' rainbow;
 :
 :points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia
 :
 :can learnedly handle, though they come to him by
 :th' gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns--why,
 :he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses.
 :You would think a smock were a she-angel, he so
 :chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the
S:square on 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Prithee bring him in, and let him
 :
 :approach singing.
S:
 :
 :PERDITA  Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words
 :
 :in 's tunes.	[Servant exits.]
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  You have of these peddlers that have
 :
S:more in them than you'd think, sister.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Autolycus, wearing a false beard, singing.]
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS
 :
 :Lawn as white as driven snow,
 :
 :Cypress black as e'er was crow,
 :
 :Gloves as sweet as damask roses,
 :Masks for faces and for noses,
 :Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
 :Perfume for a lady's chamber,
 :Golden coifs and stomachers
S:For my lads to give their dears,
 :
 :Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
 :
S:What maids lack from head to heel,
 :
 :Come buy of me, come. Come buy, come buy.
 :
S:Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry.
 :
 :Come buy.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou
 :shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled
 :as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain
 :ribbons and gloves.
 :
S:MOPSA  I was promised them against the feast, but they
 :
 :come not too late now.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORCAS  He hath promised you more than that, or there
 :be liars.
 :
 :MOPSA  He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe
 :he has paid you more, which will shame you to give
 :him again.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Is there no manners left among
 :
S:maids? Will they wear their plackets where they
 :
 :should bear their faces? Is there not milking time,
 :
 :when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle
 :
 :of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling
 :before all our guests? 'Tis well they are whisp'ring.
 :Clamor your tongues, and not a word more.
 :
 :MOPSA  I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry
S:lace and a pair of sweet gloves.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Have I not told thee how I was cozened
 :
 :by the way and lost all my money?
S:
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
 :
 :therefore it behooves men to be wary.
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose
S:nothing here.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I hope so, sir, for I have about me many
 :
 :parcels of charge.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  What hast here? Ballads?
 :
 :MOPSA  Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print
 :alife, for then we are sure they are true.
S:
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a
 :
 :usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags
 :
 :at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders'
 :heads and toads carbonadoed.
 :
 :MOPSA  Is it true, think you?
 :
S:
 :AUTOLYCUS  Very true, and but a month old.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORCAS  Bless me from marrying a usurer!
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Here's the midwife's name to 't, one Mistress
 :Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that
 :were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
S:
 :
 :MOPSA, [to Shepherd's Son]  Pray you now, buy it.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Autolycus]  Come on, lay it by, and
 :let's first see more ballads. We'll buy the other
 :things anon.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared
 :upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore
S:
 :of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and
 :
 :sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It
 :
 :was thought she was a woman, and was turned into
 :
 :a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with
 :one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and as
 :true.
 :
 :DORCAS  Is it true too, think you?
S:
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses
 :
 :more than my pack will hold.
 :
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Lay it by too. Another.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty
 :one.
 :
S:MOPSA  Let's have some merry ones.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Why, this is a passing merry one and goes
 :
 :to the tune of "Two Maids Wooing a Man." There's
 :scarce a maid westward but she sings it. 'Tis in
 :request, I can tell you.
 :
 :MOPSA  We can both sing it. If thou 'lt bear a part, thou
 :shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
S:
 :
 :
 :DORCAS  We had the tune on 't a month ago.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I can bear my part. You must know 'tis my
 :occupation. Have at it with you.
 :
 :Song.
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS	Get you hence, for I must go
 :
 :Where it fits not you to know.
 :
S:
 :
 :DORCAS	   Whither?
 :
S:
 :
 :MOPSA     O, whither?
 :
 :
 :
 :DORCAS     Whither?
S:
 :
 :MOPSA	It becomes thy oath full well
 :
 :Thou to me thy secrets tell.
 :
 :
 :DORCAS	   Me too. Let me go thither.
S:
 :
 :MOPSA	Or thou goest to th' grange or mill.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORCAS	If to either, thou dost ill.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS	   Neither.
 :
 :DORCAS     What, neither?
 :
S:
S:AUTOLYCUS     Neither.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORCAS	Thou hast sworn my love to be.
 :
 :
 :MOPSA	Thou hast sworn it more to me.
S:Then whither goest? Say whither.
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  We'll have this song out anon by
 :ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad
 :talk, and we'll not trouble them. Come, bring away
 :thy pack after me.--Wenches, I'll buy for you
 :both.--Peddler, let's have the first choice.--Follow
 :me, girls.
S:
 :[He exits with Mopsa, Dorcas, Shepherds and
 :
 :Shepherdesses.]
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  And you shall pay well for 'em.
 :
 :Song.
 :
 :Will you buy any tape,
S:
 :Or lace for your cape,
 :
 :My dainty duck, my dear-a?
 :
 :Any silk, any thread,
 :
 :Any toys for your head,
S:Of the new'st and fin'st, fin'st wear-a?
 :
 :Come to the peddler.
 :
 :Money's a meddler
 :
 :That doth utter all men's ware-a.
S:[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT, [to Shepherd]   Master, there is three carters,
S:three shepherds, three neatherds, three swineherds,
 :
 :that have made themselves all men of hair.
 :
 :They call themselves saultiers, and they have a
 :
 :dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of
 :gambols, because they are not in 't, but they themselves
 :are o' th' mind, if it be not too rough for
S:some that know little but bowling, it will please
 :
 :plentifully.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Away! We'll none on 't. Here has been too
S:much homely foolery already.--I know, sir, we
 :
 :weary you.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  You weary those that refresh us. Pray, let's
 :see these four threes of herdsmen.
 :
 :SERVANT  One three of them, by their own report, sir,
 :hath danced before the King, and not the worst of
S:the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th'
 :
 :square.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Leave your prating. Since these good men
 :are pleased, let them come in--but quickly now.
 :
 :SERVANT  Why, they stay at door, sir.
 :
S:[He admits the herdsmen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Here a Dance of twelve herdsmen, dressed as Satyrs.]
 :
 :[Herdsmen, Musicians, and Servants exit.]
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES, [to Shepherd]
 :
 :O father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
 :
 :[Aside to Camillo.] Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to
 :part them.
 :He's simple, and tells much. [To Florizell.] How now,
 :fair shepherd?
 :Your heart is full of something that does take
 :Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
S:
S:And handed love, as you do, I was wont
 :
 :To load my she with knacks. I would have ransacked
 :
 :The peddler's silken treasury and have poured it
 :
S:To her acceptance. You have let him go
 :
 :And nothing marted with him. If your lass
 :
 :Interpretation should abuse and call this
 :
 :Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
 :For a reply, at least if you make a care
 :Of happy holding her.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Old sir, I know
S:She prizes not such trifles as these are.
 :
 :The gifts she looks from me are packed and locked
 :
 :Up in my heart, which I have given already,
 :
 :But not delivered. [To Perdita.] O, hear me breathe
 :my life
 :Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
 :Hath sometime loved. I take thy hand, this hand
 :As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
S:Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fanned snow that's
 :
 :bolted
 :
 :By th' northern blasts twice o'er.
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES  What follows this?--
 :
 :How prettily th' young swain seems to wash
 :
S:The hand was fair before.--I have put you out.
 :
 :But to your protestation. Let me hear
 :
 :What you profess.
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Do, and be witness to 't.
 :
S:POLIXENES
 :
 :And this my neighbor too?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  And he, and more
 :Than he, and men--the Earth, the heavens, and
 :all--
 :That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,
 :Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
 :That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
S:
 :More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
 :
 :Without her love; for her employ them all,
 :
S:Commend them and condemn them to her service
 :
S:Or to their own perdition.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  Fairly offered.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :This shows a sound affection.
 :
 :SHEPHERD  But my daughter,
S:Say you the like to him?
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  I cannot speak
 :
 :So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better.
 :By th' pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
 :The purity of his.
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Take hands, a bargain.--
 :
 :And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
 :
 :I give my daughter to him and will make
 :Her portion equal his.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  O, that must be
 :I' th' virtue of your daughter. One being dead,
 :I shall have more than you can dream of yet,
S:
 :Enough then for your wonder. But come on,
 :
 :Contract us fore these witnesses.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Come, your hand--
 :And daughter, yours.
 :
 :POLIXENES, [To Florizell]  Soft, swain, awhile, beseech
 :you.
S:
 :Have you a father?
 :
S:
 :
 :FLORIZELL  I have, but what of him?
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :Knows he of this?
 :
 :FLORIZELL  He neither does nor shall.
 :
 :POLIXENES  Methinks a father
S:
 :Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
 :
S:That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
 :
 :Is not your father grown incapable
 :
 :Of reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid
 :
 :With age and alt'ring rheums? Can he speak? Hear?
 :Know man from man? Dispute his own estate?
 :Lies he not bedrid, and again does nothing
S:But what he did being childish?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  No, good sir.
 :
 :He has his health and ampler strength indeed
 :Than most have of his age.
 :
 :POLIXENES  By my white beard,
S:You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
 :
S:Something unfilial. Reason my son
 :
S:Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
 :
 :The father, all whose joy is nothing else
 :
 :But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
 :
 :In such a business.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  I yield all this;
 :But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
S:Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
 :
 :My father of this business.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  Let him know 't.
S:
 :
 :FLORIZELL
 :
 :He shall not.
 :
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES  Prithee let him.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  No, he must not.
 :
 :SHEPHERD
 :Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve
 :At knowing of thy choice.
 :
S:
 :FLORIZELL  Come, come, he must not.
 :
 :Mark our contract.
 :
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES, [removing his disguise]  Mark your divorce,
 :young sir,
 :Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base
 :To be acknowledged. Thou a scepter's heir
 :That thus affects a sheep-hook!--Thou, old traitor,
S:
 :I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
 :
 :But shorten thy life one week.--And thou, fresh
 :
 :piece
 :
 :Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know
S:The royal fool thou cop'st with--
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  O, my heart!
 :
 :
S:POLIXENES
 :
 :I'll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made
 :
S:More homely than thy state.--For thee, fond boy,
 :
 :If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
 :
 :That thou no more shalt see this knack--as never
 :
 :I mean thou shalt--we'll bar thee from succession,
 :Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
 :Far'r than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.
S:Follow us to the court. [To Shepherd.] Thou, churl,
 :
 :for this time,
 :
 :Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
 :
 :From the dead blow of it.--And you, enchantment,
 :Worthy enough a herdsman--yea, him too,
 :That makes himself, but for our honor therein,
 :Unworthy thee--if ever henceforth thou
 :These rural latches to his entrance open,
 :Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
S:
 :I will devise a death as cruel for thee
 :
 :As thou art tender to 't.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  Even here undone.
 :I was not much afeard, for once or twice
 :I was about to speak and tell him plainly
 :The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
 :Hides not his visage from our cottage but
S:
 :Looks on alike. [To Florizell.] Will 't please you, sir,
 :
 :be gone?
 :
 :I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,
 :
 :Of your own state take care. This dream of mine--
 :Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
 :But milk my ewes and weep.
 :
 :CAMILLO, [to Shepherd]  Why, how now, father?
S:
 :Speak ere thou diest.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  I cannot speak, nor think,
 :
S:Nor dare to know that which I know. [To Florizell.]
 :
 :O sir,
 :
 :You have undone a man of fourscore three,
 :
 :That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
 :To die upon the bed my father died,
 :To lie close by his honest bones; but now
 :Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
 :Where no priest shovels in dust. [To Perdita.] O
 :cursed wretch,
S:
 :That knew'st this was the Prince, and wouldst
 :
 :adventure
 :
 :To mingle faith with him!--Undone, undone!
 :
 :If I might die within this hour, I have lived
 :To die when I desire.	[He exits.]
 :
 :FLORIZELL, [to Perdita]  Why look you so upon me?
 :I am but sorry, not afeard; delayed,
S:
 :But nothing altered. What I was, I am,
 :
 :More straining on for plucking back, not following
 :
 :My leash unwillingly.
 :
S:
 :
S:CAMILLO  Gracious my lord,
 :
 :You know your father's temper. At this time
 :
 :He will allow no speech, which I do guess
 :
 :You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
 :Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.
 :Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,
 :Come not before him.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  I not purpose it.
S:
 :I think Camillo?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO, [removing his disguise]  Even he, my lord.
 :
 :
 :PERDITA, [to Florizell]
 :How often have I told you 'twould be thus?
S:How often said my dignity would last
 :
 :But till 'twere known?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  It cannot fail but by
 :The violation of my faith; and then
 :Let nature crush the sides o' th' Earth together
 :And mar the seeds within. Lift up thy looks.
 :From my succession wipe me, father. I
 :Am heir to my affection.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Be advised.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL
S:I am, and by my fancy. If my reason
 :
 :Will thereto be obedient, I have reason.
 :
 :If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
 :
 :Do bid it welcome.
 :
 :CAMILLO  This is desperate, sir.
 :
S:FLORIZELL
 :
 :So call it; but it does fulfill my vow.
 :
 :I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
 :
 :Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
S:Be thereat gleaned, for all the sun sees or
 :
 :The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
 :
 :In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
 :
 :To this my fair beloved. Therefore, I pray you,
 :As you have ever been my father's honored friend,
 :When he shall miss me, as in faith I mean not
 :To see him anymore, cast your good counsels
 :Upon his passion. Let myself and fortune
 :Tug for the time to come. This you may know
S:
 :And so deliver: I am put to sea
 :
 :With her who here I cannot hold on shore.
 :
 :And most opportune to our need I have
 :
 :A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
 :For this design. What course I mean to hold
 :Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
 :Concern me the reporting.
S:
 :
S:CAMILLO  O my lord,
 :
 :I would your spirit were easier for advice
 :
 :Or stronger for your need.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Hark, Perdita.--
 :
 :I'll hear you by and by.
 :
 :[Florizell and Perdita walk aside.]
 :
 :CAMILLO  He's irremovable,
 :Resolved for flight. Now were I happy if
 :His going I could frame to serve my turn,
 :Save him from danger, do him love and honor,
S:
 :Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
 :
S:And that unhappy king, my master, whom
 :
 :I so much thirst to see.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLORIZELL, [coming forward]  Now, good Camillo,
 :
 :I am so fraught with curious business that
 :
 :I leave out ceremony.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Sir, I think
 :You have heard of my poor services i' th' love
 :That I have borne your father?
S:
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Very nobly
 :
 :Have you deserved. It is my father's music
 :
 :To speak your deeds, not little of his care
 :To have them recompensed as thought on.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Well, my
 :lord,
 :If you may please to think I love the King
S:
 :And, through him, what's nearest to him, which is
 :
 :Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,
 :
 :If your more ponderous and settled project
 :
 :May suffer alteration. On mine honor,
 :I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
 :As shall become your Highness, where you may
 :Enjoy your mistress--from the whom I see
 :There's no disjunction to be made but by,
S:
 :As heavens forfend, your ruin--marry her,
 :
 :And with my best endeavors in your absence,
 :
 :Your discontenting father strive to qualify
 :
 :And bring him up to liking.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  How, Camillo,
 :May this, almost a miracle, be done,
S:That I may call thee something more than man,
 :
 :And after that trust to thee?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Have you thought on
S:A place whereto you'll go?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Not any yet.
 :
 :But as th' unthought-on accident is guilty
S:To what we wildly do, so we profess
 :
 :Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies
 :
 :Of every wind that blows.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Then list to me.
 :This follows: if you will not change your purpose
 :But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
 :And there present yourself and your fair princess,
S:For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes.
 :
 :She shall be habited as it becomes
 :
 :The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
 :
 :Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
 :His welcomes forth, asks thee, the son, forgiveness,
 :As 'twere i' th' father's person; kisses the hands
S:Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
 :
 :'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th' one
 :
 :He chides to hell and bids the other grow
 :
 :Faster than thought or time.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Worthy Camillo,
 :What color for my visitation shall I
 :Hold up before him?
 :
S:
 :CAMILLO  Sent by the King your father
 :
 :To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
 :
 :The manner of your bearing towards him, with
 :
S:What you, as from your father, shall deliver,
 :
 :Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down,
 :
 :The which shall point you forth at every sitting
 :
 :What you must say, that he shall not perceive
 :But that you have your father's bosom there
 :And speak his very heart.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  I am bound to you.
 :There is some sap in this.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  A course more promising
 :
 :Than a wild dedication of yourselves
 :
 :To unpathed waters, undreamed shores, most
 :certain
S:To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
 :
 :But as you shake off one to take another;
 :
 :Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
 :
S:Do their best office if they can but stay you
 :
 :Where you'll be loath to be. Besides, you know
 :
 :Prosperity's the very bond of love,
 :
 :Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
 :Affliction alters.
S:
 :
 :PERDITA  One of these is true.
 :
 :I think affliction may subdue the cheek
 :
 :But not take in the mind.
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  Yea, say you so?
 :
 :There shall not at your father's house these seven
 :
 :years
S:Be born another such.
 :
 :
 :
S:FLORIZELL  My good Camillo,
 :
 :She's as forward of her breeding as she is
 :
 :I' th' rear our birth.
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  I cannot say 'tis pity
 :She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
 :To most that teach.
 :
 :PERDITA  Your pardon, sir. For this
S:
 :I'll blush you thanks.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  My prettiest Perdita.
 :
 :But O, the thorns we stand upon!--Camillo,
 :Preserver of my father, now of me,
 :The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
 :We are not furnished like Bohemia's son,
 :Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
S:
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  My lord,
 :
 :Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes
 :
 :Do all lie there. It shall be so my care
 :To have you royally appointed as if
 :The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
 :That you may know you shall not want, one word.
 :[They step aside and talk.]
S:
 :
 :
S:[Enter Autolycus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Ha, ha, what a fool Honesty is! And Trust,
S:his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have
 :
 :sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone, not a
 :
 :ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table book, ballad,
 :
S:knife, tape, glove, shoe tie, bracelet, horn ring,
 :
 :to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who
 :
 :should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed
 :
 :and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which
 :means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and
 :what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My
 :clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable
 :man, grew so in love with the wenches' song that he
 :would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and
S:
 :words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that
 :
 :all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have
 :
 :pinched a placket, it was senseless; 'twas nothing to
 :
 :geld a codpiece of a purse. I could have filed
S:keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling,
 :
 :but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it. So
 :
 :that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of
 :
 :their festival purses. And had not the old man come
 :in with a hubbub against his daughter and the
 :King's son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I
 :had not left a purse alive in the whole army.
 :[Camillo, Florizell, and Perdita come forward.]
 :
S:
S:CAMILLO, [to Florizell]
 :
 :Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
 :
 :So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL
S:And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO
 :
 :Shall satisfy your father.
 :
 :PERDITA  Happy be you!
 :All that you speak shows fair.
 :
 :CAMILLO, [noticing Autolycus]  Who have we here?
S:
 :We'll make an instrument of this, omit
 :
S:Nothing may give us aid.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS, [aside]
 :
 :If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
 :
S:CAMILLO  How now, good fellow? Why shak'st thou so?
 :
 :Fear not, man. Here's no harm intended to thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I am a poor fellow, sir.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Why, be so still. Here's nobody will steal that
 :from thee. Yet for the outside of thy poverty we
 :must make an exchange. Therefore discase thee
 :instantly--thou must think there's a necessity in
S:
 :'t--and change garments with this gentleman.
 :
 :Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,
 :
 :yet hold thee, there's some boot.
 :
 :[He hands Autolycus money.]
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I am a poor fellow, sir. [Aside.] I know you
S:well enough.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  Nay, prithee, dispatch. The gentleman is half
 :
 :flayed already.
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Are you in earnest, sir? [Aside.] I smell the
 :trick on 't.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Dispatch, I prithee.
 :
S:
S:AUTOLYCUS  Indeed, I have had earnest, but I cannot
 :
 :with conscience take it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  Unbuckle, unbuckle.
 :[Florizell and Autolycus exchange garments.]
 :Fortunate mistress--let my prophecy
 :Come home to you!--you must retire yourself
 :Into some covert. Take your sweetheart's hat
 :And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
S:
 :Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
 :
 :The truth of your own seeming, that you may--
 :
 :For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
 :
 :Get undescried.
 :
 :PERDITA  I see the play so lies
 :That I must bear a part.
 :
S:
 :CAMILLO  No remedy.--
 :
S:Have you done there?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Should I now meet my father,
 :
 :He would not call me son.
 :
 :CAMILLO  Nay, you shall have no hat.
 :[He gives Florizell's hat to Perdita.]
 :Come, lady, come.--Farewell, my friend.
 :
S:
 :AUTOLYCUS  Adieu, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL
 :
 :O Perdita, what have we twain forgot?
 :Pray you, a word.	[They talk aside.]
 :
 :CAMILLO, [aside]
 :What I do next shall be to tell the King
S:
 :Of this escape, and whither they are bound;
 :
 :Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
 :
 :To force him after, in whose company
 :
 :I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight
 :I have a woman's longing.
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Fortune speed us!--
S:Thus we set on, Camillo, to th' seaside.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAMILLO  The swifter speed the better.
 :
 :[Camillo, Florizell, and Perdita exit.]
S:
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I understand the business; I hear it. To have
 :
 :an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand is
 :
 :necessary for a cutpurse; a good nose is requisite
S:also, to smell out work for th' other senses. I see this
 :
 :is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an
 :
 :exchange had this been without boot! What a boot
 :
 :is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this
 :year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore.
 :The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,
 :stealing away from his father with his clog at his
 :heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to
 :acquaint the King withal, I would not do 't. I hold it
S:
 :the more knavery to conceal it, and therein am I
 :
S:constant to my profession.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Shepherd's Son and Shepherd, carrying the
 :
 :bundle and the box.]
 :
 :Aside, aside! Here is more matter for a hot brain.
 :Every lane's end, every shop, church, session, hanging,
 :yields a careful man work.	[He moves aside.]
 :
S:
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  See, see, what a man
 :
 :you are now! There is no other way but to tell the
 :
 :King she's a changeling and none of your flesh and
 :
 :blood.
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Nay, but hear me.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Nay, but hear me!
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Go to, then.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  She being none of your flesh and
 :blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the
 :King, and so your flesh and blood is not to be
 :punished by him. Show those things you found
 :about her, those secret things, all but what she has
S:
 :with her. This being done, let the law go whistle, I
 :
 :warrant you.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  I will tell the King all, every word, yea, and
 :his son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest
S:man, neither to his father nor to me, to go about to
 :
 :make me the King's brother-in-law.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest
 :off you could have been to him, and then your
 :blood had been the dearer by I know how much an
 :ounce.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS, [aside]  Very wisely, puppies.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Well, let us to the King. There is that in this
 :
 :fardel will make him scratch his beard.
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS, [aside]  I know not what impediment this
 :complaint may be to the flight of my master.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Pray heartily he be at' palace.
S:
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS, [aside]  Though I am not naturally honest,
 :
 :I am so sometimes by chance. Let me pocket up my
 :
S:peddler's excrement. [(He removes his false beard.)]
 :
 :How now, rustics, whither are you bound?
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  To th' palace, an it like your Worship.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Your affairs there? What, with whom, the
 :condition of that fardel, the place of your dwelling,
 :your names, your ages, of what having, breeding,
S:and anything that is fitting to be known, discover!
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  We are but plain fellows, sir.
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have
 :no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they
 :often give us soldiers the lie, but we pay them for it
S:with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
 :
S:they do not give us the lie.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Your Worship had like to have given
 :
 :us one, if you had not taken yourself with the
S:manner.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Are you a courtier, an 't like you, sir?
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS  Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.
 :
 :Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
 :
 :Hath not my gait in it the measure of the
 :
S:court? Receives not thy nose court odor from me?
 :
S:Reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt?
 :
 :Think'st thou, for that I insinuate and toze from
 :
 :thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am
 :
 :courtier cap-a-pie; and one that will either push on
S:or pluck back thy business there. Whereupon I
 :
 :command thee to open thy affair.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  My business, sir, is to the King.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  What advocate hast thou to him?
 :
 :SHEPHERD  I know not, an 't like you.
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [aside to Shepherd]  Advocate's the
 :
 :court word for a pheasant. Say you have none.
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD, [to Autolycus]  None, sir. I have no pheasant,
 :cock nor hen.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS
 :How blest are we that are not simple men!
S:
 :Yet Nature might have made me as these are.
 :
 :Therefore I will not disdain.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  This cannot be but a
 :great courtier.
 :
 :SHEPHERD  His garments are rich, but he wears them
 :not handsomely.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  He seems to be the more noble in
 :
 :being fantastical. A great man, I'll warrant. I know
 :
S:by the picking on 's teeth.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  The fardel there. What's i' th' fardel?
 :
 :Wherefore that box?
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and
 :box which none must know but the King, and
 :which he shall know within this hour if I may come
 :to th' speech of him.
S:
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS  Age, thou hast lost thy labor.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Why, sir?
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  The King is not at the palace. He is gone
 :aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air
S:himself, for, if thou beest capable of things serious,
 :
 :thou must know the King is full of grief.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  So 'tis said, sir--about his son, that should
S:have married a shepherd's daughter.
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  If that shepherd be not in handfast, let him
 :
 :fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
S:feel, will break the back of man, the heart of
 :
 :monster.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Think you so, sir?
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Not he alone shall suffer what wit can
 :make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are
 :germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall
 :all come under the hangman--which, though it be
S:
 :great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling
 :
 :rogue, a ram tender, to offer to have his daughter
 :
 :come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned, but
 :
 :that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne
S:into a sheepcote? All deaths are too few, the sharpest
 :
 :too easy.
 :
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you
 :
 :hear, an 't like you, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
 :'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
 :wasps'-nest; then stand till he be three-quarters and
 :a dram dead, then recovered again with aqua vitae
 :or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and
S:in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall
 :
 :he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a
 :
 :southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him
 :
 :with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these
S:traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at,
 :
 :their offenses being so capital? Tell me--for you
 :
 :seem to be honest plain men--what you have to the
 :
 :King. Being something gently considered, I'll bring
 :you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his
 :presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be
 :in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is
 :man shall do it.
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  He seems to be of
 :
 :great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and
 :
 :though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft
S:led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your
 :
 :purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado.
 :
 :Remember: "stoned," and "flayed alive."
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD, [to Autolycus]  An 't please you, sir, to
 :
 :undertake the business for us, here is that gold I
 :
 :have. I'll make it as much more, and leave this
 :
 :young man in pawn till I bring it you.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  After I have done what I promised?
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Ay, sir.
 :
S:
 :AUTOLYCUS  Well, give me the moiety. [Shepherd hands
 :
 :him money.] Are you a party in this business?
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  In some sort, sir; but though my case
 :be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  O, that's the case of the shepherd's son!
 :Hang him, he'll be made an example.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  Comfort, good comfort.
 :
 :We must to the King, and show our strange
 :
S:sights. He must know 'tis none of your daughter nor
 :
 :my sister. We are gone else.--Sir, I will give you as
 :
 :much as this old man does when the business is
 :
 :performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it
 :be brought you.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I will trust you. Walk before toward the
 :seaside. Go on the right hand. I will but look upon
 :the hedge, and follow you.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Shepherd]  We are blessed in this
 :
 :man, as I may say, even blessed.
 :
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Let's before, as he bids us. He was provided
 :
 :to do us good.	[Shepherd and his son exit.]
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS  If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune
 :
 :would not suffer me. She drops booties in my
 :
 :mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion:
 :
S:gold, and a means to do the Prince my master good;
 :
 :which who knows how that may turn back to my
 :
 :advancement? I will bring these two moles, these
 :
 :blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore
 :them again and that the complaint they have to the
 :King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue
 :for being so far officious, for I am proof against that
 :title and what shame else belongs to 't. To him will I
 :present them. There may be matter in it.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina, and
 :Servants.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :CLEOMENES
 :
 :Sir, you have done enough, and have performed
 :
 :A saintlike sorrow. No fault could you make
 :Which you have not redeemed--indeed, paid down
 :More penitence than done trespass. At the last,
 :Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;
 :With them forgive yourself.
 :
S:
S:LEONTES  Whilst I remember
 :
 :Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
 :
 :My blemishes in them, and so still think of
 :
 :The wrong I did myself, which was so much
 :That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
 :Destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man
 :Bred his hopes out of.
 :
 :PAULINA  True, too true, my lord.
S:
 :If one by one you wedded all the world,
 :
 :Or from the all that are took something good
 :
 :To make a perfect woman, she you killed
 :
 :Would be unparalleled.
 :
 :LEONTES  I think so. Killed?
 :She I killed? I did so, but thou strik'st me
 :Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter
S:
 :Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,
 :
 :Say so but seldom.
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOMENES  Not at all, good lady.
 :
 :You might have spoken a thousand things that
 :
 :would
 :
 :Have done the time more benefit and graced
 :Your kindness better.
 :
 :PAULINA  You are one of those
 :Would have him wed again.
 :
S:
 :DION  If you would not so,
 :
 :You pity not the state nor the remembrance
 :
 :Of his most sovereign name, consider little
 :
 :What dangers by his Highness' fail of issue
 :May drop upon his kingdom and devour
 :Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy
 :Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
S:What holier than, for royalty's repair,
 :
 :For present comfort, and for future good,
 :
 :To bless the bed of majesty again
 :
 :With a sweet fellow to 't?
S:
 :
 :PAULINA  There is none worthy,
 :
 :Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
 :
 :Will have fulfilled their secret purposes.
S:For has not the divine Apollo said,
 :
 :Is 't not the tenor of his oracle,
 :
 :That King Leontes shall not have an heir
 :
 :Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall
S:Is all as monstrous to our human reason
 :
S:As my Antigonus to break his grave
 :
 :And come again to me--who, on my life,
 :
 :Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
 :
 :My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
 :Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue.
 :The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander
S:Left his to th' worthiest; so his successor
 :
 :Was like to be the best.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Good Paulina,
 :Who hast the memory of Hermione,
 :I know, in honor, O, that ever I
 :Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now
 :I might have looked upon my queen's full eyes,
 :Have taken treasure from her lips--
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  And left them
 :
 :More rich for what they yielded.
 :
S:
 :
S:LEONTES  Thou speak'st truth.
 :
 :No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,
 :
 :And better used, would make her sainted spirit
 :
 :Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
S:Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,
 :
 :And begin "Why to me?"
 :
S:
 :
 :PAULINA  Had she such power,
 :
 :She had just cause.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  She had, and would incense me
 :To murder her I married.
S:
 :
 :PAULINA  I should so.
 :
 :Were I the ghost that walked, I'd bid you mark
 :
S:Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in 't
 :
S:You chose her. Then I'd shriek, that even your ears
 :
 :Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed
 :
 :Should be "Remember mine."
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Stars, stars,
 :And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
 :I'll have no wife, Paulina.
 :
 :PAULINA  Will you swear
S:
 :Never to marry but by my free leave?
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit.
 :
 :PAULINA
 :Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
 :
S:
 :CLEOMENES
 :
 :You tempt him over-much.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Unless another
 :As like Hermione as is her picture
 :Affront his eye.
 :
 :CLEOMENES  Good madam--
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  I have done.
 :
 :Yet if my lord will marry--if you will, sir,
 :
 :No remedy but you will--give me the office
 :To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young
 :As was your former, but she shall be such
 :As, walked your first queen's ghost, it should take
S:joy
 :
 :To see her in your arms.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  My true Paulina,
S:We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  That
 :
 :Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,
 :Never till then.
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
S:
 :
 :SERVANT
 :
 :One that gives out himself Prince Florizell,
 :
 :Son of Polixenes, with his princess--she
 :The fairest I have yet beheld--desires access
 :To your high presence.
 :
S:LEONTES  What with him? He comes not
 :
 :Like to his father's greatness. His approach,
 :
 :So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
 :
 :'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
S:By need and accident. What train?
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  But few,
 :
 :And those but mean.
 :
S:LEONTES  His princess, say you, with him?
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
 :
 :Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
 :That e'er the sun shone bright on.
 :
 :PAULINA  O Hermione,
 :As every present time doth boast itself
 :Above a better gone, so must thy grave
S:
S:Give way to what's seen now. [To Servant.] Sir, you
 :
 :yourself
 :
 :Have said and writ so--but your writing now
 :
S:Is colder than that theme--she had not been
 :
 :Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse
 :
 :Flowed with her beauty once. 'Tis shrewdly ebbed
 :
 :To say you have seen a better.
 :
 :SERVANT  Pardon, madam.
 :The one I have almost forgot--your pardon;
 :The other, when she has obtained your eye,
S:Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
 :
 :Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
 :
 :Of all professors else, make proselytes
 :
 :Of who she but bid follow.
 :
 :PAULINA  How, not women?
 :
 :SERVANT
 :Women will love her that she is a woman
S:
 :More worth than any man; men, that she is
 :
 :The rarest of all women.
 :
 :
 :
S:LEONTES  Go, Cleomenes.
 :
 :Yourself, assisted with your honored friends,
 :
 :Bring them to our embracement.
 :
 :[Cleomenes and others exit.]
 :Still, 'tis strange
 :He thus should steal upon us.
 :
 :PAULINA  Had our prince,
S:Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired
 :
 :Well with this lord. There was not full a month
 :
 :Between their births.
 :
 :
S:LEONTES  Prithee, no more; cease. Thou
 :
 :know'st
 :
 :He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,
 :
 :When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
S:Will bring me to consider that which may
 :
 :Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Florizell, Perdita, Cleomenes, and others.]
 :
 :Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,
 :For she did print your royal father off,
 :Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,
 :Your father's image is so hit in you,
S:
 :His very air, that I should call you brother,
 :
 :As I did him, and speak of something wildly
 :
 :By us performed before. Most dearly welcome,
 :
 :And your fair princess--goddess! O, alas,
 :I lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and Earth
 :Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as
 :You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost--
S:All mine own folly--the society,
 :
S:Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
 :
 :Though bearing misery, I desire my life
 :
 :Once more to look on him.
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  By his command
 :Have I here touched Sicilia, and from him
 :Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
S:Can send his brother. And but infirmity,
 :
 :Which waits upon worn times, hath something
 :
 :seized
 :
S:His wished ability, he had himself
 :
 :The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
 :
 :Measured to look upon you, whom he loves--
 :
 :He bade me say so--more than all the scepters
 :And those that bear them living.
 :
 :LEONTES  O my brother,
 :Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir
 :Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
S:
 :So rarely kind, are as interpreters
 :
 :Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither,
 :
 :As is the spring to th' earth. And hath he too
 :
 :Exposed this paragon to th' fearful usage,
 :At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
 :To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
S:Th' adventure of her person?
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Good my lord,
 :
 :She came from Libya.
 :
 :LEONTES  Where the warlike Smalus,
 :That noble honored lord, is feared and loved?
 :
 :FLORIZELL
S:
 :Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose
 :
 :daughter
 :
 :His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence,
 :
 :A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed
 :To execute the charge my father gave me
S:For visiting your Highness. My best train
 :
 :I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,
 :
 :Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
 :
 :Not only my success in Libya, sir,
 :But my arrival and my wife's in safety
 :Here where we are.
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  The blessed gods
 :
 :Purge all infection from our air whilst you
 :
 :Do climate here! You have a holy father,
 :A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
 :So sacred as it is, I have done sin,
 :For which the heavens, taking angry note,
 :Have left me issueless. And your father's blest,
 :As he from heaven merits it, with you,
S:
 :Worthy his goodness. What might I have been
 :
 :Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,
 :
S:Such goodly things as you?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Lord.]
 :
 :
 :
S:LORD  Most noble sir,
 :
 :That which I shall report will bear no credit,
 :
 :Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
 :
 :Bohemia greets you from himself by me,
S:Desires you to attach his son, who has--
 :
 :His dignity and duty both cast off--
 :
S:Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
 :
 :A shepherd's daughter.
 :
 :
 :
S:LEONTES  Where's Bohemia? Speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :
 :Here in your city. I now came from him.
 :I speak amazedly, and it becomes
 :My marvel and my message. To your court
 :Whiles he was hast'ning--in the chase, it seems,
 :Of this fair couple--meets he on the way
 :The father of this seeming lady and
S:
S:Her brother, having both their country quitted
 :
S:With this young prince.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLORIZELL  Camillo has betrayed me,
 :
 :Whose honor and whose honesty till now
S:Endured all weathers.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD  Lay 't so to his charge.
 :
 :He's with the King your father.
 :
 :LEONTES  Who? Camillo?
S:
 :
S:LORD
 :
 :Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now
 :
 :Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
 :
 :Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,
 :Forswear themselves as often as they speak.
 :Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
S:With divers deaths in death.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  O my poor father!
 :
 :The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
 :Our contract celebrated.
 :
 :LEONTES  You are married?
 :
 :FLORIZELL
S:
 :We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.
 :
 :The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.
 :
 :The odds for high and low's alike.
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  My lord,
 :Is this the daughter of a king?
 :
 :FLORIZELL  She is
S:
 :When once she is my wife.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :That "once," I see, by your good father's speed
 :
 :Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
S:Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,
 :
 :Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
 :
 :Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
 :
 :That you might well enjoy her.
 :
 :FLORIZELL, [to Perdita]  Dear, look up.
 :Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
 :Should chase us with my father, power no jot
S:Hath she to change our loves.--Beseech you, sir,
 :
 :Remember since you owed no more to time
 :
 :Than I do now. With thought of such affections,
 :
 :Step forth mine advocate. At your request,
 :My father will grant precious things as trifles.
 :
 :LEONTES
 :Would he do so, I'd beg your precious mistress,
 :Which he counts but a trifle.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Sir, my liege,
 :
 :Your eye hath too much youth in 't. Not a month
 :
 :'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such
 :gazes
 :Than what you look on now.
 :
 :LEONTES  I thought of her
S:
S:Even in these looks I made. [To Florizell.] But your
 :
 :petition
 :
 :Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.
 :
 :Your honor not o'erthrown by your desires,
 :I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand
 :I now go toward him. Therefore follow me,
 :And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.

 :Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.]
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Beseech you, sir, were you present at this
S:relation?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  I was by at the opening of the fardel,
 :
 :heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he
 :found it, whereupon, after a little amazedness, we
 :were all commanded out of the chamber. Only this,
 :methought, I heard the shepherd say: he found the
 :child.
 :
S:
S:AUTOLYCUS  I would most gladly know the issue of it.
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN  I make a broken delivery of the
 :
 :business, but the changes I perceived in the King
 :
 :and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They
 :
 :seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear
 :the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their
S:dumbness, language in their very gesture. They
 :
 :looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or
 :
S:one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared
 :
 :in them, but the wisest beholder that knew
 :
 :no more but seeing could not say if th' importance
 :
 :were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it
 :must needs be.
 :
 :[Enter another Gentleman.]
 :
 :Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.--
S:
 :The news, Rogero?
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Nothing but bonfires. The oracle
 :
 :is fulfilled: the King's daughter is found! Such a
 :
 :deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that
 :ballad makers cannot be able to express it.
 :
 :[Enter another Gentleman.]
 :
S:Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward. He can
 :
 :deliver you more.--How goes it now, sir? This news
 :
 :which is called true is so like an old tale that the
 :
 :verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King
S:found his heir?
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD GENTLEMAN  Most true, if ever truth were pregnant
 :
 :by circumstance. That which you hear you'll
 :swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The
 :mantle of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the
S:neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it,
 :
 :which they know to be his character, the majesty of
 :
 :the creature in resemblance of the mother, the
 :
 :affection of nobleness which nature shows above
 :her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim
 :her with all certainty to be the King's daughter. Did
 :you see the meeting of the two kings?
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  No.
S:
 :
 :
S:THIRD GENTLEMAN  Then have you lost a sight which
 :
 :was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might
 :
S:you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in
 :
 :such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take
 :
 :leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There
 :
 :was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with
 :countenance of such distraction that they were to
 :be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being
S:ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
 :
 :daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss,
 :
 :cries "O, thy mother, thy mother!" then asks Bohemia
 :
 :forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then
 :again worries he his daughter with clipping her.
 :Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by
S:like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns.
 :
 :I never heard of such another encounter, which
 :
 :lames report to follow it and undoes description to
 :
S:do it.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  What, pray you, became of Antigonus,
 :
 :that carried hence the child?
 :
 :THIRD GENTLEMAN  Like an old tale still, which will
 :have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and
 :not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear.
 :This avouches the shepherd's son, who has not only
S:
 :his innocence, which seems much, to justify him,
 :
 :but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina
 :
 :knows.
 :
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN  What became of his bark and his
 :
 :followers?
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD GENTLEMAN  Wracked the same instant of their
 :master's death and in the view of the shepherd, so
 :that all the instruments which aided to expose the
 :child were even then lost when it was found. But O,
 :the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was
S:fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the
 :
 :loss of her husband, another elevated that the
 :
S:oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the Princess from the
 :
 :earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would
 :
 :pin her to her heart that she might no more be in
 :
 :danger of losing.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  The dignity of this act was worth the
 :audience of kings and princes, for by such was it
 :acted.
S:
 :
 :THIRD GENTLEMAN  One of the prettiest touches of all,
 :
S:and that which angled for mine eyes--caught the
 :
 :water, though not the fish--was when at the relation
 :
S:of the Queen's death--with the manner how
 :
 :she came to 't bravely confessed and lamented by
 :
 :the King--how attentiveness wounded his daughter,
 :
S:till, from one sign of dolor to another, she did,
 :
S:with an "Alas," I would fain say bleed tears, for I am
 :
 :sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble
 :
 :there changed color; some swooned, all sorrowed.
 :
 :If all the world could have seen 't, the woe had been
S:universal.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Are they returned to the court?
 :
 :
 :THIRD GENTLEMAN  No. The Princess hearing of her
 :mother's statue, which is in the keeping of
 :Paulina--a piece many years in doing and now
 :newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio
 :Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could
S:
 :put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of
 :
S:her custom, so perfectly he is her ape; he so near to
 :
 :Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one
 :
S:would speak to her and stand in hope of answer.
 :
 :Thither with all greediness of affection are they
 :
 :gone, and there they intend to sup.
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  I thought she had some great
 :matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or
 :thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,
 :visited that removed house. Shall we thither and
S:with our company piece the rejoicing?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Who would be thence that has the
 :
 :benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new
 :grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty
 :to our knowledge. Let's along.
 :[The Three Gentlemen exit.]
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Now, had I not the dash of my former life
S:
 :in me, would preferment drop on my head. I
 :
S:brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince,
 :
 :told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know
 :
 :not what. But he at that time, overfond of the
 :
 :shepherd's daughter--so he then took her to be--
 :who began to be much seasick, and himself little
 :better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery
 :remained undiscovered. But 'tis all one to
 :me, for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it
 :would not have relished among my other
S:
 :discredits.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Shepherd and Shepherd's Son,
 :
 :both dressed in rich clothing.]
 :
 :Here come those I have done good to against my
 :will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their
 :fortune.
S:
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy
 :
 :sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.
 :
S:
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Autolycus]  You are well met, sir.
 :
 :You denied to fight with me this other day because I
 :
 :was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say
 :you see them not and think me still no gentleman
 :born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen
 :born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am
 :not now a gentleman born.
 :
S:
 :AUTOLYCUS  I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
 :
S:
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON  Ay, and have been so any time these
 :
 :four hours.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD  And so have I, boy.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  So you have--but I was a gentleman
S:born before my father. For the King's son took me
 :
 :by the hand and called me brother, and then the
 :
 :two kings called my father brother, and then the
 :
 :Prince my brother and the Princess my sister called
 :my father father; and so we wept, and there was the
 :first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed.
 :
S:SHEPHERD  We may live, son, to shed many more.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Ay, or else 'twere hard luck, being in
 :
 :so preposterous estate as we are.
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all
S:the faults I have committed to your Worship and to
 :
 :give me your good report to the Prince my master.
 :
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD  Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle now
 :
 :we are gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :
S:SHEPHERD'S SON, [to Autolycus]  Thou wilt amend thy
 :
 :life?
 :
 :
 :
 :AUTOLYCUS  Ay, an it like your good Worship.
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Give me thy hand. I will swear to the
 :Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in
 :Bohemia.
 :
S:
 :SHEPHERD  You may say it, but not swear it.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?
 :
 :Let boors and franklins say it; I'll swear it.
 :
S:SHEPHERD  How if it be false, son?
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman
 :
 :may swear it in the behalf of his friend.--And
S:I'll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy
 :
 :hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know
 :
 :thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou
 :
 :wilt be drunk. But I'll swear it, and I would thou
S:wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
 :
 :
 :
S:AUTOLYCUS  I will prove so, sir, to my power.
 :
 :
 :
 :SHEPHERD'S SON  Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If
 :
 :I do not wonder how thou dar'st venture to be
 :drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark,
 :the Kings and Princes, our kindred, are going to see
 :the Queen's picture. Come, follow us. We'll be thy
S:good masters.

 :Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizell, Perdita, Camillo,
 :Paulina, and Lords.]
 :
 :
 :LEONTES
 :O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
S:
S:That I have had of thee!
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  What, sovereign sir,
 :
 :I did not well, I meant well. All my services
S:You have paid home. But that you have vouchsafed,
 :
 :With your crowned brother and these your contracted
 :
S:Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
 :
 :It is a surplus of your grace which never
 :
S:My life may last to answer.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  O Paulina,
 :
 :We honor you with trouble. But we came
 :To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery
 :Have we passed through, not without much content
 :In many singularities; but we saw not
 :That which my daughter came to look upon,
 :The statue of her mother.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  As she lived peerless,
 :
 :So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
 :
 :Excels whatever yet you looked upon
 :Or hand of man hath done. Therefore I keep it
 :Lonely, apart. But here it is. Prepare
 :To see the life as lively mocked as ever
 :Still sleep mocked death. Behold, and say 'tis well.
S:
 :[She draws a curtain
 :
 :to reveal Hermione (like a statue).]
 :
 :I like your silence. It the more shows off
 :
S:Your wonder. But yet speak. First you, my liege.
 :
 :Comes it not something near?
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Her natural posture!--
 :
 :Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
 :
 :Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
 :In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
 :As infancy and grace.--But yet, Paulina,
 :Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
 :So aged as this seems.
 :
S:
 :POLIXENES  O, not by much!
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA
 :
 :So much the more our carver's excellence,
 :Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
 :As she lived now.
 :
 :LEONTES  As now she might have done,
S:
 :So much to my good comfort as it is
 :
S:Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
 :
 :Even with such life of majesty--warm life,
 :
 :As now it coldly stands--when first I wooed her.
 :
 :I am ashamed. Does not the stone rebuke me
S:For being more stone than it?--O royal piece,
 :
 :There's magic in thy majesty, which has
 :
 :My evils conjured to remembrance and
 :
 :From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
S:Standing like stone with thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :PERDITA  And give me leave,
 :
 :And do not say 'tis superstition, that
S:I kneel, and then implore her blessing.	[She kneels.]
 :
 :Lady,
 :
 :Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
 :
S:Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  O, patience!
 :
 :The statue is but newly fixed; the color's
 :Not dry.
 :
 :CAMILLO, [to Leontes, who weeps]
 :My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
 :Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
S:
 :So many summers dry. Scarce any joy
 :
 :Did ever so long live; no sorrow
 :
 :But killed itself much sooner.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES  Dear my brother,
 :Let him that was the cause of this have power
 :To take off so much grief from you as he
 :Will piece up in himself.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Indeed, my lord,
 :
S:If I had thought the sight of my poor image
 :
 :Would thus have wrought you--for the stone is
 :
S:mine--
 :
 :I'd not have showed it.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Do not draw the curtain.
 :
 :PAULINA
S:No longer shall you gaze on 't, lest your fancy
 :
 :May think anon it moves.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES  Let be, let be.
 :
 :Would I were dead but that methinks already--
 :
 :What was he that did make it?--See, my lord,
 :Would you not deem it breathed? And that those
 :veins
 :Did verily bear blood?
 :
 :POLIXENES  Masterly done.
S:
 :The very life seems warm upon her lip.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEONTES
 :
 :The fixture of her eye has motion in 't,
 :
 :As we are mocked with art.
 :
 :PAULINA  I'll draw the curtain.
S:My lord's almost so far transported that
 :
 :He'll think anon it lives.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  O sweet Paulina,
 :Make me to think so twenty years together!
 :No settled senses of the world can match
 :The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
 :
 :PAULINA
S:
 :I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you, but
 :
 :I could afflict you farther.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  Do, Paulina,
 :For this affliction has a taste as sweet
S:As any cordial comfort. Still methinks
 :
 :There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel
 :
 :Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
 :
 :For I will kiss her.
S:
 :
 :PAULINA  Good my lord, forbear.
 :
 :The ruddiness upon her lip is wet.
 :
 :You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
 :With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
 :
 :LEONTES
 :No, not these twenty years.
 :
S:
 :PERDITA, [rising]  So long could I
 :
 :Stand by, a looker-on.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Either forbear,
 :Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
S:For more amazement. If you can behold it,
 :
 :I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
 :
 :And take you by the hand. But then you'll think--
 :
 :Which I protest against--I am assisted
 :By wicked powers.
 :
 :LEONTES  What you can make her do
 :I am content to look on; what to speak,
 :I am content to hear, for 'tis as easy
S:
 :To make her speak as move.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  It is required
 :
 :You do awake your faith. Then all stand still--
 :Or those that think it is unlawful business
 :I am about, let them depart.
 :
 :LEONTES  Proceed.
S:
 :No foot shall stir.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  Music, awake her! Strike!
 :
 :[Music sounds.]
 :'Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more. Approach.
 :Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
 :I'll fill your grave up. Stir, nay, come away.
 :Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
S:
 :Dear life redeems you.--You perceive she stirs.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Hermione descends.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:Start not. Her actions shall be holy as
 :
 :You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her
 :
 :Until you see her die again, for then
 :
 :You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.
 :When she was young, you wooed her; now in age
 :Is she become the suitor?
 :
 :LEONTES  O, she's warm!
 :If this be magic, let it be an art
S:
 :Lawful as eating.
 :
S:
 :
 :POLIXENES  She embraces him.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAMILLO  She hangs about his neck.
 :
 :If she pertain to life, let her speak too.
 :
 :
 :POLIXENES
 :Ay, and make it manifest where she has lived,
S:Or how stol'n from the dead.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  That she is living,
 :
 :Were it but told you, should be hooted at
S:Like an old tale, but it appears she lives,
 :
 :Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
 :
 :[To Perdita.] Please you to interpose, fair madam.
 :
 :Kneel
 :And pray your mother's blessing. [To Hermione.]
 :Turn, good lady.
 :Our Perdita is found.
S:
 :
 :HERMIONE  You gods, look down,
 :
 :And from your sacred vials pour your graces
 :
 :Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own,
 :Where hast thou been preserved? Where lived? How
 :found
 :Thy father's court? For thou shalt hear that I,
 :Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
 :Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
S:
 :Myself to see the issue.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAULINA  There's time enough for that,
 :
 :Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
 :Your joys with like relation. Go together,
 :You precious winners all. Your exultation
 :Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle,
 :Will wing me to some withered bough and there
S:
 :My mate, that's never to be found again,
 :
 :Lament till I am lost.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEONTES  O peace, Paulina.
 :Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
 :As I by thine a wife. This is a match,
 :And made between 's by vows. Thou hast found
 :mine--
S:
S:But how is to be questioned, for I saw her,
 :
 :As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
 :
 :A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
 :
S:For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
 :
 :An honorable husband.--Come, Camillo,
 :
 :And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
 :
 :Is richly noted and here justified
 :By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
 :[To Hermione.] What, look upon my brother! Both
 :your pardons
S:That e'er I put between your holy looks
 :
 :My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law
 :
 :And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,
 :
 :Is troth-plight to your daughter.--Good Paulina,
 :Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
 :Each one demand and answer to his part
 :Performed in this wide gap of time since first
 :We were dissevered. Hastily lead away.
 :[They exit.]
