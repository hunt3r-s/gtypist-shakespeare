S:
 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Flourish. Enter the Tribunes (including Marcus
S:Andronicus) and Senators aloft. And then enter, below,
 :
 :Saturninus and his followers at one door, and
 :
 :Bassianus and his followers at another door, with
 :
 :other Romans, Drums, and Trumpets.]
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
 :Defend the justice of my cause with arms.
S:
 :And countrymen, my loving followers,
 :
 :Plead my successive title with your swords.
 :
 :I am his firstborn son that was the last
 :
 :That wore the imperial diadem of Rome.
 :Then let my father's honors live in me,
 :Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
 :
 :BASSIANUS
S:
S:Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
 :
 :If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
 :
 :Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
 :
 :Keep, then, this passage to the Capitol,
 :And suffer not dishonor to approach
S:The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
 :
 :To justice, continence, and nobility;
 :
S:But let desert in pure election shine,
 :
 :And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS, [aloft, stepping forward and holding up the
 :crown]
 :Princes that strive by factions and by friends
 :Ambitiously for rule and empery,
 :Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
 :A special party, have by common voice,
S:
 :In election for the Roman empery,
 :
 :Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
 :
 :For many good and great deserts to Rome.
 :
S:A nobler man, a braver warrior,
 :
S:Lives not this day within the city walls.
 :
 :He by the Senate is accited home
 :
 :From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,
 :
 :That with his sons, a terror to our foes,
 :Hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms.
 :Ten years are spent since first he undertook
 :This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
S:Our enemies' pride. Five times he hath returned
 :
 :Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
 :
 :In coffins from the field.
 :
 :And now at last, laden with honor's spoils,
 :Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
 :Renowned Titus flourishing in arms.
 :Let us entreat, by honor of his name
 :Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
S:And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
 :
 :Whom you pretend to honor and adore,
 :
 :That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
 :
 :Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
 :Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
 :
S:
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :
S:Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
 :
 :In thy uprightness and integrity,
 :
 :And so I love and honor thee and thine,
 :
 :Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
 :And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
 :Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
 :That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
 :And to my fortunes and the people's favor
 :Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.
S:
 :[Bassianus' Soldiers exit.]
 :
S:
 :
S:SATURNINUS
 :
 :Friends that have been thus forward in my right,
 :
 :I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
 :
 :And to the love and favor of my country
 :Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
S:[Saturninus' Soldiers exit.]
 :
 :Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
 :
 :As I am confident and kind to thee.
 :
 :Open the gates and let me in.
 :
 :BASSIANUS
S:Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
 :
 :[Flourish. They exit to go up into the Senate House.
 :
 :The Tribunes and Senators exit from the upper stage.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Captain.]
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :Romans, make way! The good Andronicus,
S:
 :Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
 :
 :Successful in the battles that he fights,
 :
 :With honor and with fortune is returned
 :
 :From where he circumscribed with his sword
 :And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
 :
 :[Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter two of Titus'
 :sons (Lucius and Mutius) and then two men bearing a
S:
 :coffin covered with black, then two other sons (Martius
 :
 :and Quintus), then Titus Andronicus, and then Tamora
 :
 :the Queen of Goths and her sons Alarbus, Chiron and
 :
S:Demetrius, with Aaron the Moor, and others as many as
 :
 :can be, then set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Hail Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
 :Lo, as the bark that hath discharged his fraught
 :Returns with precious lading to the bay
 :From whence at first she weighed her anchorage,
 :Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
 :To resalute his country with his tears,
S:
 :Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
 :
S:Thou great defender of this Capitol,
 :
 :Stand gracious to the rites that we intend.
 :
 :Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,
 :
 :Half of the number that King Priam had,
 :Behold the poor remains alive and dead.
 :These that survive let Rome reward with love;
S:These that I bring unto their latest home,
 :
 :With burial amongst their ancestors.
 :
 :Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
 :
 :Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
S:Why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet
 :
 :To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
 :
S:Make way to lay them by their brethren.
 :
 :[They open the tomb.]
 :
 :There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
 :
 :And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.
S:O sacred receptacle of my joys,
 :
 :Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
 :
 :How many sons hast thou of mine in store
 :
 :That thou wilt never render to me more?
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
 :That we may hew his limbs and on a pile,
 :Ad manes fratrum, sacrifice his flesh
S:
S:Before this earthy prison of their bones,
 :
 :That so the shadows be not unappeased,
 :
 :Nor we disturbed with prodigies on Earth.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :I give him you, the noblest that survives,
 :
 :The eldest son of this distressed queen.
 :
 :TAMORA
S:Stay, Roman brethren!--Gracious conqueror,
 :
 :Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
 :
S:A mother's tears in passion for her son.
 :
 :And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
 :
 :O think my son to be as dear to me.
 :
 :Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
 :To beautify thy triumphs and return
S:Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
 :
 :But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
 :
 :For valiant doings in their country's cause?
 :
 :O, if to fight for king and commonweal
 :Were piety in thine, it is in these!
 :[She kneels.]
 :Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.
 :Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
 :Draw near them then in being merciful.
S:
 :Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
 :
 :Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
 :
 :These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld
 :Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
 :Religiously they ask a sacrifice.
 :To this your son is marked, and die he must,
 :T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Away with him, and make a fire straight,
 :
 :And with our swords upon a pile of wood
S:Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
 :
 :[Exit Titus' sons with Alarbus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA, [rising and speaking aside to her sons]
 :O cruel, irreligious piety!
 :
 :CHIRON, [aside to Tamora and Demetrius]
 :Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
 :
S:
 :DEMETRIUS, [aside to Tamora and Chiron]
 :
 :Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome!
 :
 :Alarbus goes to rest and we survive
 :
 :To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
 :Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
 :The selfsame gods that armed the Queen of Troy
 :With opportunity of sharp revenge
 :Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
S:
 :May favor Tamora the Queen of Goths
 :
 :(When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen)
 :
 :To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
 :
 :
 :[Enter the sons of Andronicus again with bloody swords.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :See, lord and father, how we have performed
 :Our Roman rites. Alarbus' limbs are lopped,
 :And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
 :Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
 :Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren,
 :And with loud larums welcome them to Rome.
S:
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Let it be so. And let Andronicus
 :
 :Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
 :
 :[Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb.]
 :In peace and honor rest you here, my sons,
 :Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
 :Secure from worldly chances and mishaps.
 :Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
 :Here grow no damned drugs; here are no storms,
S:
 :No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
 :
S:In peace and honor rest you here, my sons.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lavinia.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :
 :In peace and honor live Lord Titus long;
 :My noble lord and father, live in fame.
 :[She kneels.]
 :Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
S:I render for my brethren's obsequies,
 :
 :And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
 :
 :Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
 :
 :O bless me here with thy victorious hand,
 :Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
S:The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!--
 :
 :Lavinia, live, outlive thy father's days
 :
 :And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise.
 :
 :[Lavinia rises.]
 :
 :[Enter Marcus Andronicus, carrying a white robe.
S:Enter aloft Saturninus, Bassianus, Tribunes, Senators,
 :
 :and Guards.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
S:Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
S:And welcome, nephews, from successful wars--
 :
 :You that survive, and you that sleep in fame.
 :
 :Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
 :
 :That in your country's service drew your swords;
 :But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
 :That hath aspired to Solon's happiness,
S:And triumphs over chance in honor's bed.--
 :
 :Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
 :
 :Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
 :
 :Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
 :This palliament of white and spotless hue,
 :And name thee in election for the empire
 :With these our late deceased emperor's sons.
 :Be candidatus, then, and put it on
 :And help to set a head on headless Rome.
S:
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :A better head her glorious body fits
 :
 :Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
 :
 :[To Tribunes and Senators aloft.] What, should I don
 :this robe and trouble you?
 :Be chosen with proclamations today,
S:Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life,
 :
 :And set abroad new business for you all?
 :
S:Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
 :
 :And led my country's strength successfully,
 :
 :And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
 :
 :Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
 :In right and service of their noble country.
 :Give me a staff of honor for mine age,
S:But not a scepter to control the world.
 :
 :Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS  Patience, Prince Saturninus.
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS  Romans, do me right.
 :Patricians, draw your swords and sheathe them not
 :Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.--
S:Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell
 :
 :Rather than rob me of the people's hearts.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
 :That noble-minded Titus means to thee.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Content thee, prince. I will restore to thee
S:
 :The people's hearts and wean them from themselves.
 :
S:
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :
 :Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
 :
 :But honor thee, and will do till I die.
 :My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
 :I will most thankful be, and thanks, to men
S:Of noble minds, is honorable meed.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
 :I ask your voices and your suffrages.
 :Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
 :
 :TRIBUNES
 :To gratify the good Andronicus
S:
 :And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
 :
S:The people will accept whom he admits.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit I make:
 :That you create our emperor's eldest son,
 :Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope,
 :Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on Earth
 :And ripen justice in this commonweal.
 :Then, if you will elect by my advice,
S:
 :Crown him and say "Long live our emperor."
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :With voices and applause of every sort,
 :Patricians and plebeians, we create
S:Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
 :
 :And say "Long live our Emperor Saturnine."
 :
 :[A long flourish till Saturninus, Bassianus,
 :
 :and Guards come down.]
 :
 :SATURNINUS
S:Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
 :
 :To us in our election this day,
 :
 :I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
 :
 :And will with deeds requite thy gentleness.
S:And for an onset, Titus, to advance
 :
 :Thy name and honorable family,
 :
 :Lavinia will I make my empress,
 :
 :Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
 :And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
 :Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
 :
 :TITUS
 :It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match
S:
 :I hold me highly honored of your Grace;
 :
S:And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
 :
 :King and commander of our commonweal,
 :
 :The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
 :
 :My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,
 :Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord.
 :Receive them, then, the tribute that I owe,
 :Mine honor's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
 :
 :SATURNINUS
S:
 :Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.
 :
 :How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
 :
 :Rome shall record.--And when I do forget
 :
 :The least of these unspeakable deserts,
 :Romans, forget your fealty to me.
 :
 :TITUS, [to Tamora]
 :Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor,
S:
 :To him that for your honor and your state
 :
 :Will use you nobly, and your followers.
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS, [aside]
 :A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue
 :That I would choose, were I to choose anew.--
 :Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance.
 :Though chance of war hath wrought this change
S:
S:of cheer,
 :
 :Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome.
 :
 :Princely shall be thy usage every way.
 :
 :Rest on my word, and let not discontent
 :Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you
 :Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.--
 :Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
 :
 :LAVINIA
S:
S:Not I, my lord, sith true nobility
 :
 :Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Thanks, sweet Lavinia.--Romans, let us go.
 :Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.
 :Proclaim our honors, lords, with trump and drum.
 :[Flourish. Saturninus and his Guards exit, with Drums
 :and Trumpets. Tribunes and Senators exit aloft.]
S:
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :
 :Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :How, sir? Are you in earnest then, my lord?
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :Ay, noble Titus, and resolved withal
S:To do myself this reason and this right.
 :
 :[Bassianus takes Lavinia by the arm.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Suum cuique is our Roman justice.
 :This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :And that he will and shall, if Lucius live!
S:
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Saturninus and his Guards.]
 :
 :Treason, my lord. Lavinia is surprised.
 :
 :SATURNINUS
S:Surprised? By whom?
 :
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS  By him that justly may
 :
S:Bear his betrothed from all the world away.
 :
S:
 :
 :MUTIUS
 :
S:Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
 :
 :And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
 :
 :[Bassianus, Lavinia, Marcus, Lucius,
 :
 :Quintus, and Martius exit.]
 :
 :TITUS, [to Saturninus]
 :Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
 :[Saturninus, Tamora, Demetrius, Chiron,
 :Aaron, and Guards exit.]
S:
 :
 :
 :MUTIUS
 :
 :My lord, you pass not here.
 :
 :
 :TITUS  What, villain boy,
 :Barr'st me my way in Rome?
 :[He stabs Mutius.]
 :
S:
 :MUTIUS  Help, Lucius, help!
 :
 :[Mutius dies.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucius.]
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :My lord, you are unjust, and more than so!
S:
 :In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine.
 :My sons would never so dishonor me.
S:Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter aloft the Emperor Saturninus with Tamora
 :
 :and her two sons and Aaron the Moor.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Dead if you will, but not to be his wife
 :That is another's lawful promised love.	[He exits.]
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :No, Titus, no, the Emperor needs her not,
 :Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.
S:
 :I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once,
 :
 :Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
 :
 :Confederates all thus to dishonor me.
 :
 :Was none in Rome to make a stale
 :But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
 :Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
 :That said'st I begged the empire at thy hands.
 :
S:
 :TITUS
 :
 :O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
 :
 :
 :
S:SATURNINUS
 :
 :But go thy ways. Go give that changing piece
 :
 :To him that flourished for her with his sword.
 :
 :A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy,
 :One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
 :To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :These words are razors to my wounded heart.
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
 :That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
 :Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
 :If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
S:
 :Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
 :
 :And will create thee Emperess of Rome.
 :
 :Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my
 :
 :choice?
 :And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
 :Sith priest and holy water are so near,
 :And tapers burn so bright, and everything
 :In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
S:
 :I will not resalute the streets of Rome
 :
 :Or climb my palace till from forth this place
 :
 :I lead espoused my bride along with me.
 :
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
S:And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,
 :
 :If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
 :
S:She will a handmaid be to his desires,
 :
 :A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
 :
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Ascend, fair queen, to Pantheon.--Lords, accompany
 :
 :Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
S:Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
 :
 :Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered.
 :
 :There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
 :
 :[All but Titus exit.]
 :
 :TITUS
S:I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
 :
 :Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
 :
 :Dishonored thus and challenged of wrongs?
 :
 :
 :[Enter Marcus and Titus' sons Lucius, Martius,
 :and Quintus.]
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
S:
 :O Titus, see! O, see what thou hast done!
 :
 :In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
 :Nor thou, nor these confederates in the deed
 :That hath dishonored all our family.
 :Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :But let us give him burial as becomes,
 :
 :Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

 :TITUS
 :Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.
S:This monument five hundred years hath stood,
 :
 :Which I have sumptuously reedified.
 :
 :Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
 :
 :Repose in fame, none basely slain in brawls.
 :Bury him where you can. He comes not here.
 :
S:MARCUS
 :
 :My lord, this is impiety in you.
 :
 :My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him.
 :
 :He must be buried with his brethren.
 :

 :And shall, or him we will accompany.

S:He that would vouch it in any place but here.
 :
S:
 :

 :
 :

S:No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
 :
 :To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
 :And with these boys mine honor thou hast wounded.
S:My foes I do repute you every one.

 :So trouble me no more, but get you gone.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUINTUS
 :
 :He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
 :
 :

 :Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
 :[The brother (Marcus) and the sons
 :(Lucius, Martius, and Quintus) kneel.]
 :
S:
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Brother, for in that name doth nature plead--
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :Father, and in that name doth nature speak--
 :
 :TITUS
 :Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Renowned Titus, more than half my soul--
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
S:Dear father, soul and substance of us all--
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
S:His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
 :
S:That died in honor and Lavinia's cause.
 :
 :Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous.
 :
 :The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,
 :
 :That slew himself, and wise Laertes' son
 :Did graciously plead for his funerals.
S:Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,
 :
 :Be barred his entrance here.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS  Rise, Marcus, rise.
 :
 :[They rise.]
 :
 :The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
 :To be dishonored by my sons in Rome.
 :Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
S:[They put Mutius in the tomb.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends',
 :Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
 :[They all except Titus kneel and say:]
S:
 :
 :No man shed tears for noble Mutius.
 :
 :He lives in fame, that died in virtue's cause.
 :
 :[All but Marcus and Titus exit.]
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
 :
 :How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
 :Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
 :
 :TITUS
 :I know not, Marcus, but I know it is.
 :Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.
S:
 :Is she not then beholding to the man
 :
 :That brought her for this high good turn so far?
 :
 :Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
 :
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter the Emperor Saturninus, Tamora
S:and her two sons, with Aaron the Moor, Drums and
 :
 :Trumpets, at one door. Enter at the other door
 :
S:Bassianus and Lavinia, with Lucius, Martius, and
 :
 :Quintus, and others.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SATURNINUS
 :
 :So, Bassianus, you have played your prize.
 :
 :God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :And you of yours, my lord. I say no more,
 :Nor wish no less, and so I take my leave.
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
 :
 :Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
 :
S:BASSIANUS
 :
 :"Rape" call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
 :
 :My true betrothed love and now my wife?
 :
 :But let the laws of Rome determine all.
 :Meanwhile am I possessed of that is mine.
S:
 :
S:SATURNINUS
 :
 :'Tis good, sir, you are very short with us.
 :
 :But if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
 :Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
 :Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
 :By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
S:
 :This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
 :
 :Is in opinion and in honor wronged,
 :
 :That in the rescue of Lavinia
 :
S:With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
 :
 :In zeal to you, and highly moved to wrath
 :
S:To be controlled in that he frankly gave.
 :
 :Receive him then to favor, Saturnine,
 :
 :That hath expressed himself in all his deeds
 :
 :A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.
 :'Tis thou, and those, that have dishonored me.
S:Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
 :
 :How I have loved and honored Saturnine.	[He kneels.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA, [to Saturninus]
 :My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
 :Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
 :Then hear me speak indifferently for all,
 :And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :What, madam, be dishonored openly,
 :
 :And basely put it up without revenge?
S:
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
 :
 :I should be author to dishonor you.
 :But on mine honor dare I undertake
 :For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,
 :Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
 :Then at my suit look graciously on him.
 :Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
S:
 :Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
 :
 :[Aside to Saturninus.] My lord, be ruled by me; be
 :
 :won at last.
 :
S:Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.
 :
 :You are but newly planted in your throne.
 :
 :Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
 :
 :Upon a just survey take Titus' part
 :And so supplant you for ingratitude,
 :Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin.
 :Yield at entreats, and then let me alone.
 :I'll find a day to massacre them all
S:And raze their faction and their family,
 :
 :The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
 :
 :To whom I sued for my dear son's life,
 :
S:And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
 :
S:Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
 :
S:[Aloud.] Come, come, sweet emperor.--Come,
 :
 :Andronicus.--
 :
 :Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
 :
 :That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Rise, Titus, rise. My empress hath prevailed.
S:
 :
 :TITUS, [rising]
 :
 :I thank your Majesty and her, my lord.
 :
 :These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
 :
 :TAMORA
S:Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
 :
 :A Roman now adopted happily,
 :
 :And must advise the Emperor for his good.
 :
 :This day all quarrels die, Andronicus.--
 :And let it be mine honor, good my lord,
 :That I have reconciled your friends and you.--
S:For you, Prince Bassianus, I have passed
 :
 :My word and promise to the Emperor
 :
 :That you will be more mild and tractable.--
 :
 :And fear not, lords--and you, Lavinia.
 :By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
 :You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.
S:[Marcus, Lavinia, Lucius, Martius, and Quintus kneel.]
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
 :
 :That what we did was mildly as we might,

 :
 :Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends.
 :The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.
 :I will not be denied. Sweetheart, look back.
 :

S:
 :Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
 :
 :And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
 :
 :I do remit these young men's heinous faults.
 :
 :Stand up.	[They rise.]
 :Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
S:I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
 :
 :I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
 :
 :Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,
 :
 :You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.--
 :This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Tomorrow, an it please your Majesty
 :
 :To hunt the panther and the hart with me,

 :=======
 :
S:
 :AARON
 :
 :Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
 :
S:Safe out of Fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
 :
 :Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
 :
 :Advanced above pale Envy's threat'ning reach.
 :
 :As when the golden sun salutes the morn
 :And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
 :Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
S:And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
 :
 :So Tamora.
 :
 :Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,
 :
 :And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
 :Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
 :To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
 :And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
 :Hast prisoner held, fettered in amorous chains
 :And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
S:
 :Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
 :
 :Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
 :
S:I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold
 :
S:To wait upon this new-made emperess.
 :
 :To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
 :
 :This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
 :
 :This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine
 :And see his shipwrack and his commonweal's.
 :Holla! What storm is this?
 :
 :[Enter Chiron and Demetrius, braving.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :
 :Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge
 :
S:And manners, to intrude where I am graced,
 :
 :And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
 :Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,
 :And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
S:'Tis not the difference of a year or two
 :
 :Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate.
 :
 :I am as able and as fit as thou
 :
 :To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace,
 :And that my sword upon thee shall approve
 :And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
S:
 :
 :AARON, [aside]
 :
 :Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS, [to Chiron]
 :Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
 :Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,
 :Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
 :Go to. Have your lath glued within your sheath
S:
 :Till you know better how to handle it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
 :
S:Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
 :
 :Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
S:Ay, boy, grow you so brave?	[They draw.]
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON  Why, how now, lords?
 :
 :So near the Emperor's palace dare you draw
S:And maintain such a quarrel openly?
 :
 :Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge.
 :
 :I would not for a million of gold
 :
 :The cause were known to them it most concerns,
S:Nor would your noble mother for much more
 :
 :Be so dishonored in the court of Rome.
 :
 :For shame, put up.
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  Not I, till I have sheathed
 :My rapier in his bosom, and withal
 :Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
 :That he hath breathed in my dishonor here.
 :
S:
 :CHIRON
 :
 :For that I am prepared and full resolved,
 :
 :Foul-spoken coward, that thund'rest with thy tongue
 :
S:And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON  Away, I say!
 :
 :Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
 :This petty brabble will undo us all.
 :Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
 :It is to jet upon a prince's right?
 :What, is Lavinia then become so loose
 :Or Bassianus so degenerate
S:
S:That for her love such quarrels may be broached
 :
 :Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
 :
 :Young lords, beware! And should the Empress know
 :
 :This discord's ground, the music would not please.
 :
 :CHIRON
 :I care not, I, knew she and all the world.
 :I love Lavinia more than all the world.
 :
S:
 :DEMETRIUS
 :
 :Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.
 :
 :Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Why, are you mad? Or know you not in Rome
S:How furious and impatient they be,
 :
 :And cannot brook competitors in love?
 :
 :I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
 :
 :By this device.
 :
 :CHIRON  Aaron, a thousand deaths
 :Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
 :
 :AARON
S:
 :To achieve her how?
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  Why makes thou it so strange?
 :
S:She is a woman, therefore may be wooed;
 :
 :She is a woman, therefore may be won;
 :
 :She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
 :
 :What, man, more water glideth by the mill
 :Than wots the miller of, and easy it is
 :Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
 :Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,
 :Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
 :
S:
 :AARON, [aside]
 :
 :Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
 :
 :
 :
S:DEMETRIUS
 :
 :Then why should he despair that knows to court it
 :
 :With words, fair looks, and liberality?
 :
S:What, hast not thou full often struck a doe
 :
 :And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
 :
 :
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
 :
 :Would serve your turns.
 :
 :
 :CHIRON  Ay, so the turn were served.
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  Aaron, thou hast hit it.
 :
 :AARON  Would you had hit it too!
S:
 :Then should not we be tired with this ado.
 :
 :Why, hark you, hark you! And are you such fools
 :
 :To square for this? Would it offend you then
 :
 :That both should speed?
 :
 :CHIRON
S:Faith, not me.
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  Nor me, so I were one.
 :
S:
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
 :
 :'Tis policy and stratagem must do
 :That you affect, and so must you resolve
 :That what you cannot as you would achieve,
 :You must perforce accomplish as you may.
 :Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
 :Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
S:
 :A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
 :
 :Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
 :
 :My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
 :
S:There will the lovely Roman ladies troop.
 :
 :The forest walks are wide and spacious,
 :
 :And many unfrequented plots there are,
 :
 :Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.
 :Single you thither then this dainty doe,
 :And strike her home by force, if not by words.
 :This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
 :Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
 :To villainy and vengeance consecrate,
S:
 :Will we acquaint withal what we intend,
 :
 :And she shall file our engines with advice
 :
 :That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
 :
 :But to your wishes' height advance you both.
 :The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
 :The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;
 :The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.
 :There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your
S:
 :turns.
 :
 :There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,
 :
 :And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
 :Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
 :
S:DEMETRIUS
 :
S:Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
 :
 :To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,
 :
 :Per Stygia, per manes vehor.

 :
S:The hunt is up, the moon is bright and gray,

 :
 :[Enter Aaron, alone, carrying a bag of gold.]
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :He that had wit would think that I had none,
 :To bury so much gold under a tree
S:
 :And never after to inherit it.
 :
S:Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
 :
 :Know that this gold must coin a stratagem
 :
 :Which, cunningly effected, will beget
 :

S:And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest

 :My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
 :When everything doth make a gleeful boast?
S:
 :The birds chant melody on every bush,
 :

 :
S:And make a checkered shadow on the ground.
 :
 :Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
 :
S:And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
 :
 :Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
 :
 :As if a double hunt were heard at once,
 :
 :Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise.
 :And after conflict such as was supposed
 :The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed
 :When with a happy storm they were surprised,
 :And curtained with a counsel-keeping cave,
 :We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
S:
 :Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,
 :
 :Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
 :
 :Be unto us as is a nurse's song
 :
 :Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.

S:AARON
 :
 :Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
 :
S:Saturn is dominator over mine.

 :What signifies my deadly standing eye,

S:My silence, and my cloudy melancholy,

 :My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
 :
 :Even as an adder when she doth unroll
 :
 :To do some fatal execution?
 :No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
 :Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
 :Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
 :Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
S:Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
 :
 :This is the day of doom for Bassianus.
 :
 :His Philomel must lose her tongue today,
 :
 :Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
S:And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
 :
S:[He takes out a paper.]
 :
S:Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,
 :
 :And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.
 :
S:[He hands her the paper.]
 :
 :Now, question me no more. We are espied.
 :
S:Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,

S:No more, great empress. Bassianus comes.
 :
 :Be cross with him, and I'll go fetch thy sons
 :
 :To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
 :Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop?
S:Or is it Dian, habited like her,
 :
 :Who hath abandoned her holy groves
 :
 :To see the general hunting in this forest?
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Saucy controller of my private steps,
 :Had I the power that some say Dian had,
 :Thy temples should be planted presently
 :With horns, as was Acteon's, and the hounds
S:
 :Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
 :
 :Unmannerly intruder as thou art.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :Under your patience, gentle empress,
 :'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
 :And to be doubted that your Moor and you
 :Are singled forth to try experiments.
S:
 :Jove shield your husband from his hounds today!
 :
S:'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
 :
 :
 :
 :BASSIANUS
 :
 :Believe me, queen, your swarthy Cimmerian
 :Doth make your honor of his body's hue,
 :Spotted, detested, and abominable.
S:Why are you sequestered from all your train,
 :
 :Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
 :
 :And wandered hither to an obscure plot,
 :
 :Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
 :If foul desire had not conducted you?
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :And being intercepted in your sport,
S:Great reason that my noble lord be rated
 :
 :For sauciness.--I pray you, let us hence,
 :
 :And let her joy her raven-colored love.
 :
 :This valley fits the purpose passing well.
S:
 :
S:BASSIANUS
 :
 :The King my brother shall have notice of this.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.
 :Good king to be so mightily abused!
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :Why, I have patience to endure all this.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Chiron and Demetrius.]
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother,
 :Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?
S:
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
 :
 :These two have ticed me hither to this place,
 :A barren, detested vale you see it is;
 :The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
 :Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.
S:Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,
 :
 :Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.
 :
 :And when they showed me this abhorred pit,
 :
 :They told me, here at dead time of the night
 :A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
S:Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
 :
 :Would make such fearful and confused cries
 :
S:As any mortal body hearing it
 :
 :Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
 :
 :No sooner had they told this hellish tale
 :
 :But straight they told me they would bind me here
 :Unto the body of a dismal yew
 :And leave me to this miserable death.
 :And then they called me foul adulteress,
 :Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
 :That ever ear did hear to such effect.
S:
 :And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
 :
S:This vengeance on me had they executed.
 :
 :Revenge it as you love your mother's life,
 :
 :Or be you not henceforth called my children.
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS, [drawing his dagger]
 :This is a witness that I am thy son.
 :
S:CHIRON, [drawing his dagger]
 :
 :And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
 :
 :[They stab Bassianus.]
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
 :For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :Give me the poniard! You shall know, my boys,
 :
 :Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
 :
 :
S:DEMETRIUS
 :
 :Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her.
 :
 :First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.
 :
S:This minion stood upon her chastity,
 :
S:Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
 :
 :And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;
 :
 :And shall she carry this unto her grave?
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
 :And if she do, I would I were an eunuch!
 :Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
 :And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
 :
S:
 :TAMORA
 :
S:But when you have the honey you desire,
 :
 :Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
S:I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.--
 :
 :Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
 :
 :That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :
 :O Tamora, thou bearest a woman's face--
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
S:I will not hear her speak. Away with her.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :
 :Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
S:
 :
 :DEMETRIUS, [to Tamora]
 :
 :Listen, fair madam. Let it be your glory
 :
 :To see her tears, but be your heart to them
 :As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
 :
S:LAVINIA
 :
 :When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
 :
 :O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee.
 :
 :The milk thou suck'st from her did turn to marble.
 :Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
 :Yet every mother breeds not sons alike.
 :[To Chiron.] Do thou entreat her show a woman's pity.
 :
 :CHIRON
S:
 :What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
 :
S:
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :
 :'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark.
 :
 :Yet have I heard--O, could I find it now!--
 :The lion, moved with pity, did endure
 :To have his princely paws pared all away.
 :Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
 :The whilst their own birds famish in their nests.
 :O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
S:
 :Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :I know not what it means.--Away with her.
 :
S:LAVINIA
 :
 :O, let me teach thee! For my father's sake,
 :
 :That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,
 :
 :Be not obdurate; open thy deaf ears.
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
 :Even for his sake am I pitiless.--
 :Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain
S:
 :To save your brother from the sacrifice,
 :
 :But fierce Andronicus would not relent.
 :
 :Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;
 :
 :The worse to her, the better loved of me.
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :O Tamora, be called a gentle queen,
 :And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
S:
 :For 'tis not life that I have begged so long;
 :
 :Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
S:What begg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go!
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA
 :
 :'Tis present death I beg, and one thing more
 :That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.
S:O, keep me from their worse-than-killing lust,
 :
 :And tumble me into some loathsome pit
 :
 :Where never man's eye may behold my body.
 :
 :Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee.
 :
 :No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
 :
 :
S:DEMETRIUS, [to Lavinia]
 :
S:Away, for thou hast stayed us here too long!
 :
 :
 :
 :LAVINIA, [to Tamora]
 :
 :No grace, no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,
S:The blot and enemy to our general name,
 :
 :Confusion fall--
 :
S:
 :
 :CHIRON
 :
 :Nay, then, I'll stop your mouth.--Bring thou her
 :
 :husband.
 :This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
 :[They put Bassianus' body in the pit and
 :exit, carrying off Lavinia.]
 :
 :TAMORA
S:
 :Farewell, my sons. See that you make her sure.
 :
 :Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
 :
 :Till all the Andronici be made away.
 :
 :Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
 :And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.
S:[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Aaron with two of Titus' sons,
 :
 :Quintus and Martius.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Come on, my lords, the better foot before.
S:Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
 :
 :Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUINTUS
S:My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :
S:And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame,
 :
 :Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
 :
 :[He falls into the pit.]
 :
 :
 :QUINTUS
 :What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this,
S:Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers
 :
 :Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
 :
 :As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers?
 :
 :A very fatal place it seems to me.
S:Speak, brother! Hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :
S:O, brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
 :
 :That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON, [aside]
 :Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
 :That he thereby may have a likely guess
 :How these were they that made away his brother.
 :[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :MARTIUS
 :
 :Why dost not comfort me and help me out
 :
 :From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole?
 :
S:
 :
 :QUINTUS
 :
 :I am surprised with an uncouth fear.
 :
 :A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints.
 :My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
S:Aaron and thou look down into this den
 :
 :And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUINTUS
S:Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
 :
 :Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
 :
 :The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.
 :
S:O, tell me who it is, for ne'er till now
 :
 :Was I a child to fear I know not what.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood,
S:All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
 :
 :In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUINTUS
 :If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
S:
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :
 :Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
 :
 :A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
 :Which like a taper in some monument
S:Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks
 :
 :And shows the ragged entrails of this pit.
 :
 :So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
 :
 :When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
 :O, brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
 :If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath--
 :Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
 :As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
 :
S:
 :QUINTUS, [reaching into the pit]
 :
 :Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
 :
 :Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
 :
S:I may be plucked into the swallowing womb
 :
 :Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
 :
S:[He pulls Martius' hand.]
 :
 :I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
 :
 :QUINTUS
 :Thy hand once more. I will not loose again
 :Till thou art here aloft or I below.
S:
 :Thou canst not come to me. I come to thee.
 :
 :[He falls in.]

S:[Enter the Emperor Saturninus, with Attendants,

S:SATURNINUS
 :
 :Along with me! I'll see what hole is here
 :
 :And what he is that now is leapt into it.--
 :
S:Say, who art thou that lately didst descend
 :
 :Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
 :
 :
 :
S:MARTIUS
 :
S:The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
 :
 :Brought hither in a most unlucky hour
 :
 :To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
S:My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest.
 :
 :He and his lady both are at the lodge
 :
 :Upon the north side of this pleasant chase.
 :
S:'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARTIUS
 :
 :We know not where you left them all alive,
 :But, out alas, here have we found him dead.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Tamora, Titus Andronicus, and Lucius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA  Where is my lord the King?
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
 :
S:
 :TAMORA
 :
S:Where is thy brother Bassianus?
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound.
 :Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
 :The complot of this timeless tragedy,
S:
 :And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
 :
S:In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
 :
 :[She giveth Saturnine a letter.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS [(reads the letter):]
 :An if we miss to meet him handsomely,
 :Sweet huntsman--Bassianus 'tis we mean--
 :Do thou so much as dig the grave for him;
 :Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
 :Among the nettles at the elder tree
S:
 :Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
 :
 :Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
 :
 :Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.
 :
 :O Tamora, was ever heard the like?
 :This is the pit, and this the elder tree.--
 :Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
 :That should have murdered Bassianus here.
 :
S:
 :AARON
 :
 :My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
 :
 :
 :
S:SATURNINUS, [to Titus]
 :
 :Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,
 :
 :Have here bereft my brother of his life.--
 :
 :Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison.
 :There let them bide until we have devised
 :Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
S:
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
 :
 :How easily murder is discovered.
 :[Attendants pull Quintus, Martius, and
 :the body of Bassianus from the pit.]
S:
 :
 :TITUS, [kneeling]
 :
 :High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
 :
 :I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,
S:That this fell fault of my accursed sons--
 :
 :Accursed if the faults be proved in them--
 :
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :If it be proved! You see it is apparent.
 :
 :Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Andronicus himself did take it up.
 :
 :TITUS
S:
 :I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,
 :
 :For by my father's reverend tomb I vow
 :
 :They shall be ready at your Highness' will
 :
 :To answer their suspicion with their lives.
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Thou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me.--
 :Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers.
S:
S:Let them not speak a word. The guilt is plain.
 :
 :For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
 :
 :That end upon them should be executed.
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
 :Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
 :
 :TITUS, [rising]
S:
 :Come, Lucius, come. Stay not to talk with them.
 :
 :[They exit, with Attendants leading Martius and
 :
 :Quintus and bearing the body of Bassianus.]

 :=======
S:[Enter the Empress' sons, Demetrius and Chiron,
 :
 :with Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out,
 :
 :and ravished.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,

S:Write down thy mind; bewray thy meaning so,

 :
S:CHIRON, [to Lavinia]
 :
 :Go home. Call for sweet water; wash thy hands.
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
 :And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
 :
 :CHIRON
 :An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
S:

S:

 :
 :Who is this? My niece, that flies away so fast?--
 :
 :Cousin, a word. Where is your husband?
 :
 :If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me.
 :If I do wake, some planet strike me down
 :That I may slumber an eternal sleep.
 :Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
S:Hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare
 :
 :Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments
 :
 :Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
 :
 :And might not gain so great a happiness
 :As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
 :Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
S:Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind,
 :
 :Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
 :
 :Coming and going with thy honey breath.
 :
 :But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
 :And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue.
 :Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame,
 :And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
 :As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
 :Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face,
S:
 :Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
 :
 :Shall I speak for thee, shall I say 'tis so?
 :
 :O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
 :
 :That I might rail at him to ease my mind.
 :Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopped,
 :Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
 :Fair Philomela, why she but lost her tongue,
 :And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind;
S:
 :But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
 :
S:A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
 :
 :And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
 :
 :That could have better sewed than Philomel.
 :
 :O, had the monster seen those lily hands
 :Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
 :And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
S:He would not then have touched them for his life.
 :
 :Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
 :
 :Which that sweet tongue hath made,
 :
 :He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep,
 :As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
 :Come, let us go and make thy father blind,
 :For such a sight will blind a father's eye.
 :One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
 :What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter the Judges and Senators with Titus' two sons
 :(Quintus and Martius) bound, passing on the stage to
S:
 :the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
S:Hear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay.
 :
 :For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
 :
 :In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
 :
S:For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
 :
 :For all the frosty nights that I have watched,
 :
 :And for these bitter tears which now you see,
 :
 :Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
 :Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
 :Whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought.
 :For two-and-twenty sons I never wept
 :Because they died in honor's lofty bed.
 :[Andronicus lieth down, and the Judges pass by him.]
S:
 :[They exit with the prisoners as Titus continues speaking.]
 :
 :For these, tribunes, in the dust I write
 :
 :My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
 :
 :Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite.
 :My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
S:O Earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
 :
 :That shall distil from these two ancient ruins
 :
 :Than youthful April shall with all his showers.
 :
 :In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
 :In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
 :And keep eternal springtime on thy face,
S:So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn.]
 :
 :
S:O reverend tribunes, O gentle aged men,
 :
 :Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
 :
 :And let me say, that never wept before,
 :
 :My tears are now prevailing orators.
S:
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
S:O noble father, you lament in vain.
 :
 :The Tribunes hear you not; no man is by,
 :
S:And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.--
 :Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you--
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
 :
S:
 :TITUS
 :
S:Why, 'tis no matter, man. If they did hear,
 :
 :They would not mark me; if they did mark,
 :
 :They would not pity me. Yet plead I must,
 :
 :And bootless unto them.
 :Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
 :Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
 :Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,
 :For that they will not intercept my tale.
 :When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
S:
 :Receive my tears and seem to weep with me,
 :
 :And were they but attired in grave weeds,
 :
 :Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
 :
 :A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than
 :stones;
 :A stone is silent and offendeth not,
 :And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
 :But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :To rescue my two brothers from their death,
 :
 :For which attempt the Judges have pronounced
 :My everlasting doom of banishment.
 :
 :TITUS, [rising]
 :O happy man, they have befriended thee!
S:
S:Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
 :
 :That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
 :
 :Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
 :
 :But me and mine. How happy art thou then
 :From these devourers to be banished.
 :But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
 :
 :[Enter Marcus with Lavinia.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:MARCUS
 :
 :Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
 :
 :Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break.
 :
S:I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
S:Will it consume me? Let me see it, then.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :This was thy daughter.
 :
S:TITUS  Why, Marcus, so she is.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  Ay me, this object kills me!
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.--
 :
 :Speak, Lavinia. What accursed hand
 :
 :Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
S:What fool hath added water to the sea
 :
 :Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
 :
S:My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
 :
 :And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.--
 :
 :Give me a sword. I'll chop off my hands too,
 :
 :For they have fought for Rome and all in vain;
 :And they have nursed this woe in feeding life;
 :In bootless prayer have they been held up,
 :And they have served me to effectless use.
 :Now all the service I require of them
 :Is that the one will help to cut the other.--
S:
S:'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
 :
 :For hands to do Rome service is but vain.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Speak, gentle sister. Who hath martyred thee?
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,
 :
 :That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,
S:Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
 :
 :Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
 :
 :Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :O, say thou for her who hath done this deed!
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :O, thus I found her straying in the park,
 :Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
 :That hath received some unrecuring wound.
 :
S:
S:TITUS
 :
 :It was my dear, and he that wounded her
 :
 :Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.
 :
 :For now I stand as one upon a rock,
 :Environed with a wilderness of sea,
 :Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
 :Expecting ever when some envious surge
 :Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
 :This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
S:
 :Here stands my other son a banished man,
 :
 :And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
 :
 :But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
 :
 :Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
 :Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
 :It would have madded me. What shall I do,
 :Now I behold thy lively body so?
 :Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
S:
 :Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.
 :
 :Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
 :
 :Thy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.--
 :
S:Look, Marcus!--Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
 :
 :When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
 :
 :Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
 :
 :Upon a gathered lily almost withered.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband,
 :Perchance because she knows them innocent.
 :
S:
S:TITUS
 :
 :If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
 :
 :Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.--
 :
 :No, no, they would not do so foul a deed.
 :Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.--
 :Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
 :Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
S:Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
 :
 :And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
 :
 :Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,
 :
 :How they are stained like meadows yet not dry
 :With miry slime left on them by a flood?
 :And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
 :Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
 :And made a brine pit with our bitter tears?
 :Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
S:
 :Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
 :
 :Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
 :
 :What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
 :
S:Plot some device of further misery
 :
 :To make us wondered at in time to come.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief
 :See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Patience, dear niece.--Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
 :Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
 :For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.

S:Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
 :
 :That to her brother which I said to thee.
 :

 :
 :Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
S:O, what a sympathy of woe is this,

 :
 :[Enter Aaron the Moor alone.]
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
 :Sends thee this word, that if thou love thy sons,
S:
S:Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
 :
 :Or any one of you, chop off your hand
 :
 :And send it to the King; he for the same
 :
S:Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
 :
 :And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
S:O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
 :
 :Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
 :
 :That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
 :
 :With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand.
 :Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine,
 :
S:That hath thrown down so many enemies,
 :
 :Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.
 :
 :My youth can better spare my blood than you,
 :
 :And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
 :And reared aloft the bloody battleax,
 :Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
S:
 :O, none of both but are of high desert.
 :
 :My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
 :
 :To ransom my two nephews from their death.
 :
S:Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
 :For fear they die before their pardon come.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :My hand shall go.

S:

 :
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Sirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these
 :
 :Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
 :Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
 :
 :MARCUS
S:
 :And for our father's sake and mother's care,
 :
 :Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Agree between you. I will spare my hand.
 :
 :LUCIUS  Then I'll go fetch an ax.
 :
S:
 :MARCUS  But I will use the ax.	[Lucius and Marcus exit.]

 :Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
 :

 :If that be called deceit, I will be honest
S:
S:And never whilst I live deceive men so.
 :

S:

 :
S:Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand.
 :
 :Tell him it was a hand that warded him
 :
 :From thousand dangers. Bid him bury it.
 :
 :More hath it merited; that let it have.
 :As for my sons, say I account of them
 :As jewels purchased at an easy price,
 :And yet dear, too, because I bought mine own.
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand
 :
 :Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
 :
 :[Aside.] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy
S:Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
 :
 :Let fools do good and fair men call for grace;

 :O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
 :And bow this feeble ruin to the earth.	[He kneels.]
 :If any power pities wretched tears,
S:
 :To that I call. [(Lavinia kneels.)] What, wouldst thou
 :
 :kneel with me?
 :
S:Do, then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our
 :
 :prayers,
 :
 :Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
 :
S:And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
 :
 :When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :O brother, speak with possibility,
 :And do not break into these deep extremes.
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
S:Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
 :
 :Then be my passions bottomless with them.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
S:But yet let reason govern thy lament.
 :
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :If there were reason for these miseries,
 :
S:Then into limits could I bind my woes.
 :
 :When heaven doth weep, doth not the Earth o'erflow?
 :
 :If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
 :
 :Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoll'n face?
 :And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
 :I am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth flow!
 :She is the weeping welkin, I the Earth.
 :Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
S:Then must my Earth with her continual tears
 :
 :Become a deluge, overflowed and drowned,
 :
 :Forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes
 :
 :But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
 :Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
 :To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
S:For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor.
 :
 :Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,
 :
 :And here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back.
 :
S:Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked,
 :
 :That woe is me to think upon thy woes
 :
 :More than remembrance of my father's death.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
S:MARCUS
 :
S:Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily,
 :
 :And be my heart an everburning hell!
 :
 :These miseries are more than may be borne.
 :
 :To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
 :But sorrow flouted at is double death.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound
 :And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
S:
 :That ever death should let life bear his name,
 :
 :Where life hath no more interest but to breathe.
 :
 :[Lavinia kisses Titus.]
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
 :As frozen water to a starved snake.
 :
S:
 :TITUS
 :
 :When will this fearful slumber have an end?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
 :Thou dost not slumber. See thy two sons' heads,
 :Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,
 :Thy other banished son with this dear sight
S:
 :Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
 :
 :Even like a stony image cold and numb.
 :
S:Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs.
 :
 :Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand,
 :
S:Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight
 :
 :The closing up of our most wretched eyes.
 :
 :Now is a time to storm. Why art thou still?
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS  Ha, ha, ha!
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
 :[Titus and Lavinia rise.]
 :
 :TITUS
 :Why, I have not another tear to shed.
S:
 :Besides, this sorrow is an enemy
 :
 :And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
 :
S:And make them blind with tributary tears.
 :
 :Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
 :
 :For these two heads do seem to speak to me
 :
 :And threat me I shall never come to bliss
 :Till all these mischiefs be returned again
 :Even in their throats that hath committed them.
S:Come, let me see what task I have to do.
 :
 :You heavy people, circle me about
 :
 :That I may turn me to each one of you
 :
 :And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
S:The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
 :
 :And in this hand the other will I bear.--
 :
 :And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in these arms.
 :
 :Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy
 :teeth.--
 :As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight.
 :Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
 :Hie to the Goths and raise an army there.
 :And if you love me, as I think you do,
S:
 :Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
 :
 :[All but Lucius exit.]
 :

 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
 :The woefull'st man that ever lived in Rome.
 :Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again.
S:He loves his pledges dearer than his life.
 :
 :Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister.
 :
 :O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
 :
 :But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
 :But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
 :If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs
S:And make proud Saturnine and his empress
 :
 :Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.
 :
 :Now will I to the Goths and raise a power
 :
 :To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

 :=======
 :[A banquet. Enter Titus Andronicus, Marcus, Lavinia,
S:
S:and the boy Young Lucius, with Servants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :So, so. Now sit, and look you eat no more
 :Than will preserve just so much strength in us
 :As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
 :Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot.
 :Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands
S:
 :And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
 :
 :With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
 :
 :Is left to tyrannize upon my breast,
 :
 :Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
 :Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
 :Then thus I thump it down.--
 :Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs,
 :When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
S:
 :Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
 :
 :Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
 :
 :Or get some little knife between thy teeth
 :
 :And just against thy heart make thou a hole,
S:That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
 :
 :May run into that sink and, soaking in,
 :
 :Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
 :
S:
 :
S:MARCUS
 :
 :Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
 :
 :Such violent hands upon her tender life.
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
 :Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
 :What violent hands can she lay on her life?
S:Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,
 :
 :To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
 :
S:How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
 :
 :O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
 :
 :Lest we remember still that we have none.--
 :
 :Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
S:As if we should forget we had no hands
 :
 :If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
 :
 :Come, let's fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this.
 :
S:Here is no drink!--Hark, Marcus, what she says.
 :
 :I can interpret all her martyred signs.
 :
 :She says she drinks no other drink but tears
 :
 :Brewed with her sorrow, mashed upon her cheeks.--
 :Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought.
S:In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
 :
 :As begging hermits in their holy prayers.
 :
 :Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
 :
S:Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
 :
S:But I of these will wrest an alphabet
 :
 :And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.
 :
 :
 :
 :YOUNG LUCIUS, [weeping]
S:Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments.
 :
 :Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
 :Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Peace, tender sapling. Thou art made of tears,
S:
 :And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
 :
S:[Marcus strikes the dish with a knife.]

 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :At that that I have killed, my lord, a fly.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Out on thee, murderer! Thou kill'st my heart.
 :Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny;
S:
 :A deed of death done on the innocent
 :
 :Becomes not Titus' brother. Get thee gone.
 :
 :I see thou art not for my company.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Alas, my lord, I have but killed a fly.
 :
S:
 :

 :
 :"But"? How if that fly had a father and mother?
 :
 :How would he hang his slender gilded wings
 :And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
 :Poor harmless fly,
 :That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
S:Came here to make us merry! And thou hast killed
 :
 :him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Pardon me, sir. It was a black, ill-favored fly,
 :Like to the Empress' Moor. Therefore I killed him.
 :
 :TITUS  O, O, O!
 :Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
S:
 :For thou hast done a charitable deed.
 :
 :Give me thy knife. I will insult on him,
 :
 :Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
 :
 :Come hither purposely to poison me.
S:There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
 :
 :Ah, sirrah!
 :
 :Yet I think we are not brought so low
 :
 :But that between us we can kill a fly
 :That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
S:

 :Alas, poor man, grief has so wrought on him
 :
 :He takes false shadows for true substances.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Come, take away.--Lavinia, go with me.

 :

S:

 :

 :
 :Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
 :
 :
 :YOUNG LUCIUS
S:My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
 :
 :Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
 :
 :For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
 :
 :Extremity of griefs would make men mad,
S:And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
 :
 :Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,
 :
 :Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
 :
 :Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
S:And would not but in fury fright my youth,
 :
 :Which made me down to throw my books and fly,
 :
 :Causeless, perhaps.--But pardon me, sweet aunt.
 :
 :And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
S:I will most willingly attend your Ladyship.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS  Lucius, I will.
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :How now, Lavinia?--Marcus, what means this?
 :
 :Some book there is that she desires to see.--
 :
 :Which is it, girl, of these?--Open them, boy.--
 :[To Lavinia.] But thou art deeper read and better
 :skilled.
 :Come and take choice of all my library,
 :And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
S:Reveal the damned contriver of this deed.--
 :
 :Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
S:I think she means that there were more than one
 :
 :Confederate in the fact. Ay, more there was,
 :
S:Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
 :
 :YOUNG LUCIUS
S:Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphosis.
 :
 :My mother gave it me.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS  For love of her that's gone,
S:Perhaps, she culled it from among the rest.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Soft! So busily she turns the leaves.
 :
 :Help her! What would she find?--Lavinia, shall I read?
 :This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
 :And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape.
 :And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.
 :
 :MARCUS
S:
 :See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
 :Ravished and wronged as Philomela was,
S:Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
 :
S:See, see! Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt--
 :
 :O, had we never, never hunted there!--
 :
 :Patterned by that the poet here describes,
 :
 :By nature made for murders and for rapes.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :O, why should nature build so foul a den,
 :Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
 :
 :What Roman lord it was durst do the deed.
 :Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
 :That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
 :
 :MARCUS
S:Sit down, sweet niece.--Brother, sit down by me.
 :
 :[They sit.]
 :
 :Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury
 :
 :Inspire me, that I may this treason find.--
 :My lord, look here.--Look here, Lavinia.
 :[He writes his name with his staff and guides it
 :with feet and mouth.]
 :This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,
S:This after me. I have writ my name
 :
 :Without the help of any hand at all.
 :
 :Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
 :
 :Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
 :What God will have discovered for revenge.
 :Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
 :That we may know the traitors and the truth.
 :[She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it
 :with her stumps and writes.]
S:
 :O, do you read, my lord, what she hath writ?
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS

 :"Stuprum. Chiron, Demetrius."

 :What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora
S:Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?

 :
 :Tam lentus audis scelera, tam lentus vides?
 :
 :MARCUS
S:O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know
 :
 :There is enough written upon this earth
 :
 :To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
 :
 :And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
 :My lord, kneel down with me.--Lavinia, kneel.--
 :And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope,
S:[They all kneel.]
 :
 :And swear with me--as, with the woeful fere
 :
 :And father of that chaste dishonored dame,
 :
 :Lord Junius Brutus swore for Lucrece' rape--
 :That we will prosecute by good advice
 :Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
 :And see their blood or die with this reproach.
 :[They rise.]
S:

 :TITUS
 :
 :'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
 :
 :But if you hunt these bearwhelps, then beware;
S:The dam will wake an if she wind you once.
 :
 :She's with the lion deeply still in league,

 :And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
 :You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone.
 :And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
 :And with a gad of steel will write these words,

S:
 :O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
 :
 :And not relent, or not compassion him?
 :

 :That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
 :Than foemen's marks upon his battered shield,
 :But yet so just that he will not revenge.

S:Led us to Rome, strangers, and, more than so,
 :
 :Captives, to be advanced to this height?
 :
 :It did me good before the palace gate
 :
 :To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
 :

 :But me more good to see so great a lord

 :
 :
 :
 :NURSE  Good morrow, lords.
S:O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
 :Here Aaron is. And what with Aaron now?
 :
 :NURSE
 :O, gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
 :Now help, or woe betide thee evermore.
S:
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
 :
 :What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?
 :
S:NURSE
 :
 :O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
 :
S:Our empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace.
 :
 :She is delivered, lords, she is delivered.
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON  To whom?
 :
 :NURSE  I mean, she is brought abed.
 :
 :AARON
S:Well, God give her good rest. What hath he sent her?
 :
 :
 :
 :NURSE  A devil.
 :
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :Why, then she is the devil's dam. A joyful issue!
 :
 :
 :
 :NURSE
 :A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
 :Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
S:Amongst the fair-faced breeders of our clime.
 :
 :The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
 :
S:And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Zounds, you whore, is black so base a hue?
 :[To the baby.] Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous
 :blossom, sure.
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  Villain, what hast thou done?
 :
S:
 :AARON  That which thou canst not undo.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHIRON  Thou hast undone our mother.
 :
 :
 :AARON  Villain, I have done thy mother.
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
S:
 :Woe to her chance, and damned her loathed choice!
 :
 :Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
 :
 :
 :
 :CHIRON  It shall not live.
 :
 :AARON  It shall not die.
 :
S:NURSE
 :
 :Aaron, it must. The mother wills it so.
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
S:What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
 :
 :Do execution on my flesh and blood.
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
S:Nurse, give it me. My sword shall soon dispatch it.
 :
S:
 :
 :AARON, [taking the baby]
 :
S:Sooner this sword shall plow thy bowels up!
 :
 :Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother?
 :
 :Now, by the burning tapers of the sky
 :
 :That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
S:He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
 :
 :That touches this my firstborn son and heir.
 :
 :I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus
 :
 :With all his threat'ning band of Typhon's brood,
S:Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war
 :
 :Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
 :
 :What, what, you sanguine, shallow-hearted boys,
 :
 :You white-limed walls, you alehouse painted signs!
 :Coal-black is better than another hue
 :In that it scorns to bear another hue;
 :For all the water in the ocean
 :Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
S:Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
 :
 :Tell the Empress from me, I am of age
 :
 :To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
 :
 :AARON
 :My mistress is my mistress, this myself,
S:
 :The vigor and the picture of my youth.
 :
 :This before all the world do I prefer;
 :
 :This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
 :
 :Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

S:

 :I blush to think upon this ignomy.
 :
 :AARON
 :Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears.
 :Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
S:
 :The close enacts and counsels of thy heart.
 :
 :Here's a young lad framed of another leer.
 :
 :Look how the black slave smiles upon the father,
 :
 :As who should say "Old lad, I am thine own."
 :He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
 :Of that self blood that first gave life to you,
 :And from that womb where you imprisoned were
 :He is enfranchised and come to light.
S:
 :Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
 :
 :Although my seal be stamped in his face.
 :
 :
 :
 :NURSE
 :Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
S:
 :And we will all subscribe to thy advice.
 :
 :Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
 :My son and I will have the wind of you.
 :Keep there. Now talk at pleasure of your safety.
 :
S:
 :DEMETRIUS, [to the Nurse]
 :
 :How many women saw this child of his?
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league,
 :I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,
S:The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
 :
 :The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
 :
S:[To the Nurse.] But say again, how many saw the
 :
 :child?
 :
 :
 :
 :NURSE
 :Cornelia the midwife and myself,
 :And no one else but the delivered Empress.
 :
 :AARON
 :The Empress, the midwife, and yourself.
S:
 :Two may keep counsel when the third's away.
 :
 :Go to the Empress; tell her this I said.
 :
 :[He kills her.]
 :
 :"Wheak, wheak"! So cries a pig prepared to the spit.
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
 :
S:
 :AARON
 :
 :O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
 :
 :Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
 :
S:A long-tongued babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
 :
 :And now be it known to you my full intent:
 :
 :Not far one Muliteus my countryman
 :
S:His wife but yesternight was brought to bed.
 :
 :His child is like to her, fair as you are.
 :
 :Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
 :
 :And tell them both the circumstance of all,
 :And how by this their child shall be advanced
 :And be received for the Emperor's heir,
S:And substituted in the place of mine,
 :
 :To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
 :
 :And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.
 :
 :Hark you, lords, you see I have given her physic,
 :[indicating the Nurse]
 :And you must needs bestow her funeral.
S:The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.
 :
 :This done, see that you take no longer days,
 :
 :But send the midwife presently to me.
 :
 :The midwife and the nurse well made away,
 :Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
 :
 :CHIRON
 :Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
 :With secrets.
S:
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS  For this care of Tamora,
 :
 :Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
 :
S:[Demetrius and Chiron exit,
 :
 :carrying the Nurse's body.]
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
 :There to dispose this treasure in mine arms
 :And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.--
 :Come on, you thick-lipped slave, I'll bear you hence,
S:For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
 :
 :I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
 :
 :And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
 :
S:And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
 :
 :To be a warrior and command a camp.

 :Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Titus, old Marcus, his son Publius, young
 :Lucius, and other gentlemen (Caius and Sempronius)
 :with bows, and Titus bears the arrows with letters on
 :the ends of them.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Come, Marcus, come. Kinsmen, this is the way.--
 :
 :Sir boy, let me see your archery.
 :Look you draw home enough and 'tis there straight.--
 :Terras Astraea reliquit.
 :Be you remembered, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.--
 :Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
S:
S:Go sound the ocean and cast your nets;
 :
 :Happily you may catch her in the sea;
 :
S:Yet there's as little justice as at land.
 :
S:No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it.
 :
 :'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
 :
 :And pierce the inmost center of the Earth.
 :
S:Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
 :
 :I pray you, deliver him this petition.
 :
 :Tell him it is for justice and for aid,
 :
 :And that it comes from old Andronicus,
S:Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
 :
 :Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable
 :
 :What time I threw the people's suffrages
 :
 :On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
S:Go, get you gone, and pray be careful all,
 :
 :And leave you not a man-of-war unsearched.
 :
 :This wicked emperor may have shipped her hence,
 :
 :And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :O Publius, is not this a heavy case
 :
 :To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
S:
 :
 :PUBLIUS
 :
 :Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
 :
 :By day and night t' attend him carefully,
S:And feed his humor kindly as we may,
 :
 :Till time beget some careful remedy.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy
 :But ...
 :Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war
S:Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
 :
 :And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
S:What, have you met with her?
 :
 :
 :
 :PUBLIUS
 :
 :No, my good lord, but Pluto sends you word,
 :If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.
 :Marry, for Justice, she is so employed,
 :He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
 :So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
 :
S:
 :TITUS
 :
 :He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
 :
 :I'll dive into the burning lake below
 :
 :And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
 :Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,
 :No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size,
 :But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
 :Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can
S:
 :bear;
 :
 :And sith there's no justice in Earth nor hell,
 :
 :We will solicit heaven and move the gods
 :
S:To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
 :
 :Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.
 :
 :[He gives them the arrows.]
 :
 :"Ad Jovem," that's for you;--here, "Ad Apollinem";--
 :"Ad Martem," that's for myself;--
 :Here, boy, "to Pallas";--here, "to Mercury";--
 :"To Saturn," Caius--not to Saturnine!
 :You were as good to shoot against the wind.
 :To it, boy!--Marcus, loose when I bid.
S:
 :Of my word, I have written to effect;
 :
 :There's not a god left unsolicited.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court.
 :We will afflict the Emperor in his pride.
 :
 :TITUS
S:
 :Now, masters, draw. [(They shoot.)] O, well said,
 :
 :Lucius!
 :
 :Good boy, in Virgo's lap! Give it Pallas.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon.
 :
 :Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Ha, ha! Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
 :
 :See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns!
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :This was the sport, my lord; when Publius shot,
 :The Bull, being galled, gave Aries such a knock
 :That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court,
S:And who should find them but the Empress' villain?
 :
 :She laughed and told the Moor he should not choose
 :
 :But give them to his master for a present.
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Why, there it goes. God give his Lordship joy!
 :
S:[Enter a country fellow with a basket and two
 :
 :pigeons in it.]
 :
 :
 :
 :News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is
 :come.--
S:Sirrah, what tidings? Have you any letters?
 :
 :Shall I have Justice? What says Jupiter?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that
 :he hath taken them down again, for the man must
 :not be hanged till the next week.
 :
 :TITUS  But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
 :
S:
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  Alas, sir, I know not Jubiter; I never
 :
 :drank with him in all my life.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS  Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
S:
 :
 :TITUS  Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  From heaven? Alas, sir, I never
 :came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press
 :to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with
 :my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter
 :of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's
 :men.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARCUS, [to Titus]  Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to
 :
 :serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons
 :
 :to the Emperor from you.
 :
 :TITUS  Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor
 :with a grace?
 :
S:
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  Nay, truly, sir, I could never say
 :
 :grace in all my life.
 :
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
 :
 :But give your pigeons to the Emperor.
 :
 :By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
 :Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy
S:charges.--Give me pen and ink.--Sirrah, can you
 :
 :with a grace deliver up a supplication?
 :
 :[He writes.]
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  Ay, sir.
 :
 :TITUS  Then here is a supplication for you, and when
 :you come to him, at the first approach you must
 :kneel, then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons,
S:
 :and then look for your reward. I'll be at
 :
 :hand, sir. See you do it bravely.
 :
S:[He hands him a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  I warrant you, sir. Let me alone.
 :
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come, let me see it.--
 :
 :[He takes the knife and gives it to Marcus.]
 :Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration,
S:For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.--
 :
 :And when thou hast given it to the Emperor,
 :
 :Knock at my door and tell me what he says.
 :
 :
 :COUNTRY FELLOW  God be with you, sir. I will.
 :[He exits.]
 :

 :=======
 :
S:[Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora
 :
 :and her two sons Chiron and Demetrius, with
 :
 :Attendants. The Emperor brings the arrows in his
 :
 :hand that Titus shot at him.]
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
 :An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
S:
 :Troubled, confronted thus, and for the extent
 :
 :Of equal justice, used in such contempt?
 :
 :My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
 :
 :However these disturbers of our peace
S:Buzz in the people's ears, there naught hath passed
 :
 :But even with law against the willful sons
 :
 :Of old Andronicus. And what an if
 :
 :His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits?
 :Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
 :His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
 :And now he writes to heaven for his redress!
 :See, here's "to Jove," and this "to Mercury,"
 :This "to Apollo," this to the god of war.
S:
 :Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
 :
 :What's this but libeling against the Senate
 :
S:And blazoning our unjustice everywhere?
 :
 :A goodly humor is it not, my lords?
 :
 :As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
 :
 :But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
S:Shall be no shelter to these outrages,
 :
 :But he and his shall know that justice lives
 :
S:In Saturninus' health, whom, if he sleep,
 :
 :He'll so awake as he in fury shall
 :
 :Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
 :Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
 :Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
 :Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
S:
S:Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his
 :
 :heart,
 :
 :And rather comfort his distressed plight
 :
 :Than prosecute the meanest or the best
 :For these contempts. [(Aside.)] Why, thus it shall
S:become
 :
 :High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
 :
 :But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick.
 :
 :Thy lifeblood out, if Aaron now be wise,
S:Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.

S:Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege.

 :SATURNINUS  What news with thee, Aemilius?
S:

 :AEMILIUS

 :Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
 :
 :The Goths have gathered head, and with a power
 :Of high-resolved men bent to the spoil,
 :They hither march amain under conduct
 :Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,
 :Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
S:
 :As much as ever Coriolanus did.
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
 :These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
 :As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms.
 :Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.
S:'Tis he the common people love so much.
 :
 :Myself hath often heard them say,
 :
 :When I have walked like a private man,
 :
 :That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
 :And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
 :
S:
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius
 :
 :And will revolt from me to succor him.
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name.
 :Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it?
 :The eagle suffers little birds to sing
S:
 :And is not careful what they mean thereby,
 :
 :Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
 :
 :He can at pleasure stint their melody.
 :
S:Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
 :
 :Then cheer thy spirit, for know, thou emperor,
 :
 :I will enchant the old Andronicus
 :
 :With words more sweet and yet more dangerous
S:Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,

 :Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,

S:Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.

S:Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting

 :Be bold in us. We'll follow where thou lead'st,
 :
 :Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
 :
 :Led by their master to the flowered fields,
 :And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
 :
 :GOTHS
 :And as he saith, so say we all with him.
 :
S:
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
 :
 :But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Goth, leading of Aaron with his child in his arms.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :SECOND GOTH
 :
 :Renowned Lucius, from our troops I strayed
 :
 :To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,
 :
 :And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
 :Upon the wasted building, suddenly
 :I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
 :I made unto the noise, when soon I heard
 :The crying babe controlled with this discourse:
S:
 :"Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame!
 :
 :Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
 :
 :Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
 :
 :Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.
S:But where the bull and cow are both milk white,
 :
 :They never do beget a coal-black calf.
 :
S:Peace, villain, peace!"--even thus he rates the babe--
 :
 :"For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth
 :
 :Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,
 :
 :Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake."
 :With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,
S:Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither
 :
 :To use as you think needful of the man.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
 :That robbed Andronicus of his good hand;
 :This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye;
 :And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.--
S:Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
 :
 :This growing image of thy fiendlike face?
 :
 :Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?--
 :
 :A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
 :And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
 :
 :AARON
S:Touch not the boy. He is of royal blood.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Too like the sire for ever being good.
 :
S:First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl,
 :
S:A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
 :
 :Get me a ladder.
 :
 :[A ladder is brought, which Aaron is made to climb.]
 :
 :
 :AARON  Lucius, save the child
 :And bear it from me to the Empress.
 :If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things
S:That highly may advantage thee to hear.
 :
 :If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
 :
 :I'll speak no more but "Vengeance rot you all!"
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Say on, and if it please me which thou speak'st,
 :Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourished.
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :And if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,
 :
 :'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
 :
 :For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,
 :Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
 :Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,
 :Ruthful to hear, yet piteously performed.
 :And this shall all be buried in my death,
 :Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
S:
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Tell on thy mind. I say thy child shall live.
 :
S:
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
 :
S:
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god.
 :
 :That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :What if I do not? As indeed I do not.
 :Yet, for I know thou art religious
 :And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
 :With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
S:
 :Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
 :
 :Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
 :
 :An idiot holds his bauble for a god
 :
 :And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
 :To that I'll urge him. Therefore thou shalt vow
S:By that same god, what god soe'er it be
 :
 :That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
 :
 :To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,
 :
 :Or else I will discover naught to thee.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
 :
 :AARON
S:
 :First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :O, most insatiate and luxurious woman!
 :
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
 :
 :To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
 :
 :'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus.
 :They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravished her,
 :And cut her hands, and trimmed her as thou sawest.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :O detestable villain, call'st thou that trimming?
S:
 :
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :Why, she was washed, and cut, and trimmed; and
 :
 :'twas
 :
 :Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.
 :
 :LUCIUS
S:O, barbarous beastly villains, like thyself!
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :
 :Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
 :That codding spirit had they from their mother,
 :As sure a card as ever won the set;
 :That bloody mind I think they learned of me,
 :As true a dog as ever fought at head.
 :Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
S:
 :I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole
 :
 :Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay.
 :
 :I wrote the letter that thy father found,
 :
S:And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,
 :
 :Confederate with the Queen and her two sons.
 :
 :And what not done that thou hast cause to rue,
 :
 :Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
 :I played the cheater for thy father's hand,
 :And, when I had it, drew myself apart
 :And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
 :I pried me through the crevice of a wall
 :When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads,
S:
S:Beheld his tears, and laughed so heartily
 :
 :That both mine eyes were rainy like to his.
 :
 :And when I told the Empress of this sport,
 :
S:She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,
 :
 :And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
 :
 :
 :
 :GOTH
 :What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
 :
 :AARON
 :Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
 :
S:
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
 :
 :
 :
 :AARON
 :Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
 :Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
 :Few come within the compass of my curse--
S:Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
 :
 :As kill a man, or else devise his death;
 :
 :Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it;
 :
 :Accuse some innocent and forswear myself;
 :Set deadly enmity between two friends;
 :Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
 :Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,
 :And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
 :Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves
S:
 :And set them upright at their dear friends' door,
 :
S:Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,
 :
 :And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
 :
 :Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
 :
 :"Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead."
S:But I have done a thousand dreadful things
 :
 :As willingly as one would kill a fly,
 :
 :And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
 :
S:But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
S:Bring down the devil, for he must not die
 :
 :So sweet a death as hanging presently.
 :
 :[Aaron is brought down from the ladder.]
 :
 :
 :AARON
S:If there be devils, would I were a devil,
 :
 :To live and burn in everlasting fire,
 :
 :So I might have your company in hell
 :
 :But to torment you with my bitter tongue.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
S:

 :

 :
 :GOTH
 :My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
 :Desires to be admitted to your presence.
 :

S:
 :Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?
 :
 :
 :
 :AEMILIUS
 :
S:Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
 :
 :The Roman Emperor greets you all by me;
 :
 :And, for he understands you are in arms,
 :
 :He craves a parley at your father's house,
S:Willing you to demand your hostages,
 :
 :And they shall be immediately delivered.
 :
S:
 :
 :GOTH  What says our general?
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
 :
 :Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
S:And we will come. March away.

S:Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Tamora and her two sons, disguised.]
 :
 :
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment
 :
 :I will encounter with Andronicus
 :
 :And say I am Revenge, sent from below
 :To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
 :Knock at his study, where they say he keeps
S:To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge.
 :
 :Tell him Revenge is come to join with him
 :
S:And work confusion on his enemies.
 :
 :
 :
 :[They knock, and Titus (above) opens his study door.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Who doth molest my contemplation?
 :Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
 :That so my sad decrees may fly away
S:
 :And all my study be to no effect?
 :
 :You are deceived, for what I mean to do,
 :
 :See here, in bloody lines I have set down,
 :
S:And what is written shall be executed.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
 :
 :TITUS
S:No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
 :
 :Wanting a hand to give it action?
 :
 :Thou hast the odds of me; therefore, no more.
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
 :
 :TITUS
 :I am not mad. I know thee well enough.
S:
 :Witness this wretched stump; witness these crimson
 :
 :lines;
 :
 :Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
 :
 :Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
 :Witness all sorrow that I know thee well
 :For our proud empress, mighty Tamora.
 :Is not thy coming for my other hand?
 :
S:
 :TAMORA
 :
 :Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora.
 :
 :She is thy enemy, and I thy friend.
 :
 :I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom
 :To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
 :By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
 :Come down and welcome me to this world's light.
 :Confer with me of murder and of death.
S:
 :There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
 :
 :No vast obscurity or misty vale
 :
 :Where bloody murder or detested rape
 :
S:Can couch for fear but I will find them out,
 :
 :And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
 :
 :Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent to me
 :To be a torment to mine enemies?
 :
 :TAMORA
S:
 :I am. Therefore come down and welcome me.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Do me some service ere I come to thee.
 :Lo, by thy side, where Rape and Murder stands,
S:Now give some surance that thou art Revenge:
 :
 :Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot wheels,
 :
 :And then I'll come and be thy wagoner,
 :
 :And whirl along with thee about the globe,
 :Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
 :To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away,
 :And find out murderers in their guilty caves.
 :And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
S:I will dismount and by thy wagon wheel
 :
 :Trot like a servile footman all day long,
 :
 :Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
 :
 :Until his very downfall in the sea.
 :And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
 :So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
 :
 :TAMORA
 :These are my ministers and come with me.
S:
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Are they thy ministers? What are they called?
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :Rape and Murder; therefore called so
 :'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are,
 :
 :And you the Empress! But we worldly men
 :Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
 :O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,
 :And if one arm's embracement will content thee,
 :I will embrace thee in it by and by.
 :[He exits above.]
S:
 :
 :
 :TAMORA
 :
 :This closing with him fits his lunacy.
 :
 :Whate'er I forge to feed his brainsick humors,
S:Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
 :
S:For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
 :
 :And, being credulous in this mad thought,
 :
 :I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
 :
 :And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
 :I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
 :To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
S:Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
 :
 :See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Titus.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
 :Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.--
 :Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
 :How like the Empress and her sons you are!
 :Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.
 :Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
S:
 :For well I wot the Empress never wags
 :
S:But in her company there is a Moor;
 :
 :And, would you represent our queen aright,
 :
 :It were convenient you had such a devil.
 :
 :But welcome as you are. What shall we do?
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
 :
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :Show me a murderer; I'll deal with him.
S:
 :
 :CHIRON
 :
 :Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
 :
 :And I am sent to be revenged on him.
 :
 :TAMORA
S:Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
 :
 :And I will be revenged on them all.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS, [to Demetrius]
 :Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
 :And when thou findst a man that's like thyself,
S:Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
 :
 :[To Chiron.] Go thou with him, and when it is thy
 :
 :hap
 :
 :To find another that is like to thee,
S:Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.
 :
 :[To Tamora.] Go thou with them; and in the
 :
S:Emperor's court
 :
 :There is a queen attended by a Moor.
 :
 :Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
 :
 :For up and down she doth resemble thee.
 :I pray thee, do on them some violent death.
 :They have been violent to me and mine.
 :
S:TAMORA
 :
 :Well hast thou lessoned us; this shall we do.
 :
 :But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
 :
S:To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
 :
 :Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
 :
 :And bid him come and banquet at thy house?
 :
 :When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
 :I will bring in the Empress and her sons,
 :The Emperor himself, and all thy foes,
 :And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
 :And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
 :What says Andronicus to this device?
S:
 :
 :
 :TITUS, [calling]
 :
 :Marcus, my brother, 'tis sad Titus calls.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Marcus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius.
 :Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.
 :Bid him repair to me and bring with him
 :Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths.
 :Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.
S:Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too
 :
 :Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
 :
 :This do thou for my love, and so let him,
 :
 :As he regards his aged father's life.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :This will I do, and soon return again.	[Marcus exits.]
 :
 :TAMORA
S:
 :Now will I hence about thy business
 :
S:And take my ministers along with me.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
 :Or else I'll call my brother back again
 :And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
 :
S:TAMORA, [aside to Chiron and Demetrius]
 :
 :What say you, boys? Will you abide with him
 :
 :Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
 :
 :How I have governed our determined jest?
 :Yield to his humor, smooth and speak him fair,
 :And tarry with him till I turn again.
 :
S:TITUS, [aside]
 :
 :I knew them all, though they supposed me mad,
 :
 :And will o'erreach them in their own devices--
 :
 :A pair of cursed hellhounds and their dam!
 :
 :DEMETRIUS, [aside to Tamora]
 :Madam, depart at pleasure. Leave us here.
 :
 :TAMORA
S:
 :Farewell, Andronicus. Revenge now goes
 :
 :To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
 :
 :
 :
S:TITUS
 :
 :I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
 :
 :[Tamora exits.]
 :
 :
 :CHIRON
 :Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed?
S:
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :Tut, I have work enough for you to do.--
 :
 :Publius, come hither; Caius, and Valentine.
 :
 :[Publius, Caius, and Valentine enter.]
 :
 :
 :PUBLIUS  What is your will?
S:
 :
 :
S:TITUS  Know you these two?
 :
 :
 :
 :PUBLIUS
 :
 :The Empress' sons, I take them--Chiron, Demetrius.
 :
 :TITUS
 :Fie, Publius, fie, thou art too much deceived.
 :The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name;
 :And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
S:
 :Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
 :
 :Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
 :
 :And now I find it. Therefore bind them sure,
 :
 :And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.
 :[Titus exits.]
 :
S:CHIRON
 :
 :Villains, forbear! We are the Empress' sons.
 :
 :
 :
 :PUBLIUS
 :And therefore do we what we are commanded.--
S:Stop close their mouths; let them not speak a word.
 :
 :Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife, and Lavinia
 :with a basin.]
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :Come, come, Lavinia. Look, thy foes are bound.--
S:
 :Sirs, stop their mouths. Let them not speak to me,
 :
 :But let them hear what fearful words I utter.--
 :
 :O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
 :
S:Here stands the spring whom you have stained with
 :
 :mud,
 :
 :This goodly summer with your winter mixed.
 :
 :You killed her husband, and for that vile fault
 :Two of her brothers were condemned to death,
 :My hand cut off and made a merry jest,
 :Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
 :Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
 :Inhuman traitors, you constrained and forced.
S:
 :What would you say if I should let you speak?
 :
 :Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
 :
 :Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr you.
 :
 :This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
 :Whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
 :The basin that receives your guilty blood.
 :You know your mother means to feast with me,
 :And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
S:
 :Hark, villains, I will grind your bones to dust,
 :
S:And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
 :
 :And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
 :
 :And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
 :
 :And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
 :Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
 :This is the feast that I have bid her to,
S:And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
 :
 :For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
 :
 :And worse than Procne I will be revenged.
 :
 :And now prepare your throats.--Lavinia, come,
 :Receive the blood.	[He cuts their throats.]
 :And when that they are dead,
 :Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
S:And with this hateful liquor temper it,
 :
 :And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
 :
 :Come, come, be everyone officious
 :
 :To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
 :More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
 :So. Now bring them in, for I'll play the cook
 :And see them ready against their mother comes.
 :[They exit, carrying the dead bodies.]

S:To slay his daughter with his own right hand
 :
 :Because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?
 :
 :
 :
 :SATURNINUS  It was, Andronicus.
 :
 :TITUS  Your reason, mighty lord?
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Because the girl should not survive her shame,
S:
 :And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
 :
 :
 :
 :TITUS
 :
 :A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
 :A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant
 :For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
 :Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,
 :And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die.
S:

 :Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
 :They ravished her and cut away her tongue,
 :And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
S:
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :
 :Go fetch them hither to us presently.
 :
 :
 :TITUS
S:Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
 :
 :Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
 :
 :Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
 :
 :'Tis true, 'tis true! Witness my knife's sharp point.
 :[He stabs the Empress.]
 :
 :SATURNINUS
 :Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed.
 :[He kills Titus.]
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
S:Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
 :
 :[He kills Saturninus.]
 :
 :There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
 :
 :[A great tumult. Lucius, Marcus, and
 :others go aloft to the upper stage.]
 :
 :MARCUS
 :You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
 :By uproars severed as a flight of fowl
S:
 :Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
 :
 :O, let me teach you how to knit again
 :
S:This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
 :
 :These broken limbs again into one body,
 :
 :Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
 :
S:And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
 :
 :Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
 :
 :Do shameful execution on herself.
 :
 :But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
 :Grave witnesses of true experience,
 :Cannot induce you to attend my words,
 :[He turns to Lucius.]
 :Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
S:When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
 :
 :To lovesick Dido's sad-attending ear
 :
 :The story of that baleful burning night
 :
 :When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy.
 :Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,
 :Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
 :That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.--
 :My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
 :Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
S:
 :But floods of tears will drown my oratory
 :
 :And break my utterance even in the time
 :
 :When it should move you to attend me most
 :
 :And force you to commiseration.
 :Here's Rome's young captain. Let him tell the tale,
 :While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
 :
 :That Chiron and the damned Demetrius
 :
 :Were they that murdered our emperor's brother,
 :And they it were that ravished our sister.
 :For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
S:Our father's tears despised, and basely cozened
 :
 :Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
 :
 :And sent her enemies unto the grave;
 :
S:Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
 :
 :The gates shut on me, and turned weeping out
 :
 :To beg relief among Rome's enemies,
 :
 :Who drowned their enmity in my true tears
 :And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
 :I am the turned-forth, be it known to you,
 :That have preserved her welfare in my blood
 :And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
 :Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.
S:
S:Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
 :
 :My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
 :
 :That my report is just and full of truth.
 :
 :But soft, methinks I do digress too much,
 :Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me,
 :For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.
S:
 :Of this was Tamora delivered,
 :
 :The issue of an irreligious Moor,
 :
 :Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
 :
 :The villain is alive in Titus' house,
 :And as he is to witness, this is true.
 :Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
 :These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,
 :Or more than any living man could bear.
S:
 :Now have you heard the truth. What say you,
 :
 :Romans?
 :
 :Have we done aught amiss? Show us wherein,
 :
 :And from the place where you behold us pleading,
 :The poor remainder of Andronici
 :Will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves,
 :And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
S:And make a mutual closure of our house.
 :
 :Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,
 :
S:Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
 :
 :
 :
 :AEMILIUS
 :
 :Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
 :And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
 :Lucius our emperor, for well I know
 :The common voice do cry it shall be so.
 :
 :ROMANS
S:
 :Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS, [to Attendants]
 :
 :Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
 :And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
 :To be adjudged some direful slaught'ring death
 :As punishment for his most wicked life.
 :[Attendants exit. Lucius and Marcus
S:
 :come down from the upper stage.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ROMANS
 :
S:Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Thanks, gentle Romans. May I govern so
S:To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!
 :
 :But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
 :
 :For nature puts me to a heavy task.
 :
 :Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near
S:To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
 :
 :[He kisses Titus.]
 :
 :O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
 :
 :These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face,
 :The last true duties of thy noble son.
 :
 :MARCUS
 :Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
S:Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.
 :
 :[He kisses Titus.]
 :
 :O, were the sum of these that I should pay
 :
 :Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.
 :
 :LUCIUS, [to Young Lucius]
 :Come hither, boy. Come, come, and learn of us
 :To melt in showers. Thy grandsire loved thee well.
 :Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
S:
 :Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
 :
 :Many a story hath he told to thee,
 :
 :And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
 :
S:And talk of them when he was dead and gone.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARCUS
 :
 :How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
 :When they were living, warmed themselves on thine!
 :O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss.
 :Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave.
 :Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.
 :
S:
 :YOUNG LUCIUS
 :
 :O grandsire, grandsire, ev'n with all my heart
 :
 :Would I were dead so you did live again!
 :
 :[He kisses Titus.]
 :O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.
 :My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.
 :
 :[Enter Aaron with Guards.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ROMAN
 :
S:You sad Andronici, have done with woes.
 :
 :Give sentence on this execrable wretch
 :
 :That hath been breeder of these dire events.
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him.
 :There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
 :If anyone relieves or pities him,
S:For the offense he dies. This is our doom.
 :
 :Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.
 :
 :
 :
S:AARON
 :
 :Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
 :
 :I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
 :
 :I should repent the evils I have done.
S:Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
 :
S:Would I perform, if I might have my will.
 :
 :If one good deed in all my life I did,
 :
S:I do repent it from my very soul.
 :
 :[Aaron is led off by Guards.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
 :And give him burial in his fathers' grave.
 :My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
 :Be closed in our household's monument.
 :As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,
S:
 :No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed;
 :
 :No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
 :
 :But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.
 :
 :Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
 :And being dead, let birds on her take pity.
S:[They exit, carrying the dead bodies.]
