S:
 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his mother
 :the Countess, and Helen, Lord Lafew, all in black.]
 :
 :
S:
 :COUNTESS  In delivering my son from me, I bury a second
 :
 :husband.
 :
 :
 :
S:BERTRAM  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my
 :
 :father's death anew; but I must attend his Majesty's
 :
 :command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore
 :
 :in subjection.
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  You shall find of the King a husband, madam;
 :
 :you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times
 :
 :good must of necessity hold his virtue to you,
 :whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted
 :rather than lack it where there is such abundance.
 :
 :COUNTESS  What hope is there of his Majesty's
 :amendment?
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam,
 :
S:under whose practices he hath persecuted time
 :
 :with hope, and finds no other advantage in the
 :
 :process but only the losing of hope by time.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  This young gentlewoman had a father--O,
S:that "had," how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill
 :
 :was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched
 :
S:so far, would have made nature immortal, and
 :
 :death should have play for lack of work. Would for
 :
S:the King's sake he were living! I think it would be
 :
 :the death of the King's disease.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  How called you the man you speak of,
 :madam?
 :
S:COUNTESS  He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it
 :
 :was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  He was excellent indeed, madam. The King
 :
 :very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.
 :
 :He was skillful enough to have lived still, if
S:knowledge could be set up against mortality.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  What is it, my good lord, the King languishes
 :
 :of?
 :
 :LAFEW  A fistula, my lord.
 :
 :BERTRAM  I heard not of it before.
 :
S:
 :LAFEW  I would it were not notorious.--Was this gentlewoman
 :
 :the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to
 :my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good
 :that her education promises. Her dispositions she
S:inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an
 :
S:unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
 :
 :commendations go with pity--they are virtues and
 :
 :traitors too. In her they are the better for their simplenes
 :s.
 :
 :She derives her honesty and achieves her
 :goodness.
 :
 :LAFEW  Your commendations, madam, get from her
 :tears.
S:
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS  'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her
 :
 :praise in. The remembrance of her father never
 :
 :approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows
 :takes all livelihood from her cheek.--No
 :more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be
 :rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have--
 :
 :HELEN  I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
 :
 :excessive grief the enemy to the living.
 :
S:
 :
S:COUNTESS  If the living be enemy to the grief, the
 :
 :excess makes it soon mortal.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
 :
 :LAFEW  How understand we that?
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father
S:
S:In manners as in shape. Thy blood and virtue
 :
 :Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
 :
 :Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few,
 :
 :Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy
 :Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
 :Under thy own life's key Be checked for silence,
 :But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,
 :That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
 :Fall on thy head. [To Lafew.] Farewell, my lord.
S:
 :'Tis an unseasoned courtier. Good my lord,
 :
 :Advise him.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  He cannot want the best that shall
S:Attend his love.
 :
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS  Heaven bless him.--Farewell, Bertram.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  The best wishes that can be forged in your
 :thoughts be servants to you.	[Countess exits.]
 :[To Helen.] Be comfortable to my mother, your
 :mistress, and make much of her.
 :
 :LAFEW  Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit
S:
 :of your father. 	[Bertram and Lafew exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :O, were that all! I think not on my father,
 :
 :And these great tears grace his remembrance more
 :Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
 :I have forgot him. My imagination
 :Carries no favor in 't but Bertram's.
 :I am undone. There is no living, none,
 :If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
S:
 :That I should love a bright particular star
 :
S:And think to wed it, he is so above me.
 :
 :In his bright radiance and collateral light
 :
 :Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
 :
 :Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
S:The hind that would be mated by the lion
 :
 :Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
 :
 :To see him every hour, to sit and draw
 :
 :His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls
 :In our heart's table--heart too capable
 :Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.
 :But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
 :Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?
 :
S:
 :[Enter Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :
 :One that goes with him. I love him for his sake,
 :
 :And yet I know him a notorious liar,
 :Think him a great way fool, solely a coward.
 :Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
 :That they take place when virtue's steely bones
S:Looks bleak i' th' cold wind. Withal, full oft we see
 :
 :Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  Save you, fair queen.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  And you, monarch.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  No.
S:
 :
 :HELEN  And no.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Are you meditating on virginity?
 :
 :HELEN  Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let
S:me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity.
 :
 :How may we barricado it against him?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Keep him out.
 :
S:HELEN  But he assails, and our virginity, though
 :
S:valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us
 :
 :some warlike resistance.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  There is none. Man setting down before you
 :
 :will undermine you and blow you up.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
 :blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins
S:might blow up men?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Virginity being blown down, man will
 :
S:quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him
 :
S:down again, with the breach yourselves made you
 :
 :lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
 :
 :of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity
 :
 :is rational increase, and there was never
S:virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you
 :
 :were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by
 :
 :being once lost may be ten times found; by being
 :
 :ever kept, it is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion.
S:Away with 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I
 :
 :die a virgin.
 :
 :PAROLLES  There's little can be said in 't. 'Tis against the
 :
 :rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is
 :to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible
S:
 :disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin;
 :
 :virginity murders itself and should be buried in
 :
S:highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
 :
 :offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
 :
 :much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very
 :
 :paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
 :Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
 :self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
 :canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by
 :'t. Out with 't! Within ten year it will make itself
 :two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal
S:
 :itself not much the worse. Away with 't!
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own
 :
 :liking?
 :
 :PAROLLES  Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne'er
 :it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
 :lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with 't
S:
 :while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity,
 :
S:like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
 :
S:fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the
 :
 :brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now.
 :
 :Your date is better in your pie and your porridge
 :
S:than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old
 :
 :virginity, is like one of our French withered pears:
 :
 :it looks ill, it eats dryly; marry, 'tis a withered pear.
 :
 :It was formerly better, marry, yet 'tis a withered
S:pear. Will you anything with it?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Not my virginity, yet--
 :
 :There shall your master have a thousand loves,
 :A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
 :A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
 :A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
 :A counselor, a traitress, and a dear;
 :His humble ambition, proud humility,
S:
 :His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
 :
S:His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world
 :
 :Of pretty, fond adoptious christendoms
 :
S:That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
 :
 :I know not what he shall. God send him well.
 :
 :The court's a learning place, and he is one--
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  What one, i' faith?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  What's pity?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :That wishing well had not a body in 't
S:Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,
 :
 :Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
 :
 :Might with effects of them follow our friends
 :
 :And show what we alone must think, which never
S:Returns us thanks.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Page.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PAGE  Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember
 :thee, I will think of thee at court.
S:
S:
 :
 :HELEN  Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a
 :
 :charitable star.
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Under Mars, I.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  I especially think under Mars.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why under Mars?
 :
 :HELEN  The wars hath so kept you under that you
 :must needs be born under Mars.
S:
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  When he was predominant.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  When he was retrograde, I think rather.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why think you so?
 :
 :HELEN  You go so much backward when you fight.
 :
 :PAROLLES  That's for advantage.
S:
 :
 :
 :HELEN  So is running away, when fear proposes the
 :
 :safety. But the composition that your valor and
 :
 :fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I
 :like the wear well.
 :
 :PAROLLES  I am so full of businesses I cannot answer
 :thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the
S:
 :which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
 :
S:thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel
 :
 :and understand what advice shall thrust upon
 :
S:thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
 :
 :thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When
 :
 :thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
 :
 :none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband,
 :and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
 :[Parolles and Page exit.]
S:
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
 :
 :Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
 :Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
 :Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
S:What power is it which mounts my love so high,
 :
 :That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
 :
 :The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
 :
 :To join like likes and kiss like native things.
 :Impossible be strange attempts to those
 :That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
S:What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
 :
 :To show her merit that did miss her love?
 :
S:The King's disease--my project may deceive me,
 :
 :But my intents are fixed and will not leave me.
 :
 :[She exits.]

 :=======
 :[Flourish cornets. Enter the King of France with letters,
 :two Lords, and divers Attendants.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:KING
 :
 :The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears,
 :
 :Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
 :
 :A braving war.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  So 'tis reported, sir.
 :
 :KING
 :Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it
S:
 :A certainty vouched from our cousin Austria,
 :
 :With caution that the Florentine will move us
 :
 :For speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend
 :
 :Prejudicates the business and would seem
 :To have us make denial.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  His love and wisdom,
 :Approved so to your Majesty, may plead
S:
 :For amplest credence.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING  He hath armed our answer,
 :
 :And Florence is denied before he comes.
 :
 :Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
 :The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
 :To stand on either part.
 :
S:SECOND LORD  It well may serve
 :
 :A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
 :
 :For breathing and exploit.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  What's he comes here?
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :It is the Count Rossillion, my good lord,
 :Young Bertram.
 :
 :KING  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face.
S:
 :Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
 :
 :Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
 :
 :Mayst thou inherit too. Welcome to Paris.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
S:My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :I would I had that corporal soundness now
 :As when thy father and myself in friendship
 :First tried our soldiership. He did look far
 :Into the service of the time and was
 :Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long,
 :But on us both did haggish age steal on
S:
 :And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
 :
 :To talk of your good father. In his youth
 :
 :He had the wit which I can well observe
 :
 :Today in our young lords; but they may jest
 :Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
 :Ere they can hide their levity in honor.
 :So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
S:Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
 :
 :His equal had awaked them, and his honor,
 :
 :Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
 :
S:Exception bid him speak, and at this time
 :
S:His tongue obeyed his hand. Who were below him
 :
 :He used as creatures of another place
 :
 :And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,
 :
 :Making them proud of his humility,
 :In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
 :Might be a copy to these younger times,
 :Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now
 :But goers backward.
 :
S:
 :BERTRAM  His good remembrance, sir,
 :
 :Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.
 :
S:So in approof lives not his epitaph
 :
 :As in your royal speech.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Would I were with him! He would always say--
 :Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
 :He scattered not in ears, but grafted them
 :To grow there and to bear. "Let me not live"--
 :This his good melancholy oft began
S:
 :On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
 :
 :When it was out--"Let me not live," quoth he,
 :
 :"After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
 :
 :Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
 :All but new things disdain, whose judgments are
 :Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies
S:Expire before their fashions." This he wished.
 :
 :I, after him, do after him wish too,
 :
 :Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
 :
 :I quickly were dissolved from my hive
 :To give some laborers room.
S:
 :
S:SECOND LORD  You're loved, sir.
 :
 :They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :I fill a place, I know 't.--How long is 't, count,
 :Since the physician at your father's died?
S:He was much famed.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Some six months since, my lord.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :If he were living, I would try him yet.--
S:Lend me an arm.--The rest have worn me out
 :
 :With several applications. Nature and sickness
 :
 :Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count.
 :
 :My son's no dearer.
 :
 :BERTRAM  Thank your Majesty.

S:

 :
 :
 :STEWARD  Madam, the care I have had to even your
 :content I wish might be found in the calendar of

S:

S:you I do not all believe. 'Tis my slowness that I do

S:fellow.
 :
 :

 :

S:have your Ladyship's good will to go to the world,

 :Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
 :
 :FOOL  I do beg your good will in this case.
 :
 :COUNTESS  In what case?
S:
 :
 :FOOL  In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage,
 :
 :and I think I shall never have the blessing of
 :
 :God till I have issue o' my body, for they say bairns
 :are blessings.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
 :
S:FOOL  My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven
 :
 :on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil
 :
 :drives.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Is this all your Worship's reason?
 :
 :FOOL  Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such
 :as they are.
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS  May the world know them?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you
 :and all flesh and blood are, and indeed I do marry
 :that I may repent.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have
 :
 :friends for my wife's sake.
 :
 :
 :
S:COUNTESS  Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  You're shallow, madam, in great friends, for the
 :
 :knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary
 :of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives
 :me leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
 :drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher
 :of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
 :and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves
S:
 :my flesh and blood is my friend. Ergo, he that
 :
 :kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented
 :
 :to be what they are, there were no fear in
 :
 :marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan and old
S:Poysam the Papist, howsome'er their hearts are
 :
 :severed in religion, their heads are both one; they
 :
 :may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and
 :calumnious knave?
 :
S:FOOL  A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the
 :
 :next way:
 :
 :[Sings.]	For I the ballad will repeat
 :
 :Which men full true shall find:
S:Your marriage comes by destiny;
 :
 :Your cuckoo sings by kind.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Get you gone, sir. I'll talk with you more
 :anon.
 :
S:STEWARD  May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen
 :
 :come to you. Of her I am to speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak
 :with her--Helen, I mean.
S:
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :
 :"Was this fair face the cause," quoth she,
 :
 :"Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
 :Fond done, done fond.
 :Was this King Priam's joy?"
 :With that she sighed as she stood,
 :With that she sighed as she stood,
 :And gave this sentence then:
S:
S:"Among nine bad if one be good,
 :
 :Among nine bad if one be good,
 :
 :There's yet one good in ten."
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  What, one good in ten? You corrupt the
 :song, sirrah.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  One good woman in ten, madam, which is a
 :
 :purifying o' th' song. Would God would serve the
 :
 :world so all the year! We'd find no fault with the
S:tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten,
 :
 :quoth he? An we might have a good woman born
 :
 :but or every blazing star or at an earthquake,
 :
 :'twould mend the lottery well. A man may draw his
 :heart out ere he pluck one.
 :
 :COUNTESS  You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command
 :you!
 :
S:
 :FOOL  That man should be at woman's command, and
 :
 :yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no Puritan,
 :
 :yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
 :
 :humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
 :going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come
 :hither.	[He exits.]
 :
 :COUNTESS  Well, now.
S:
 :
 :
 :STEWARD  I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman
 :
 :entirely.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to
S:me, and she herself, without other advantage, may
 :
 :lawfully make title to as much love as she finds.
 :
 :There is more owing her than is paid, and more
 :
 :shall be paid her than she'll demand.
 :
 :STEWARD  Madam, I was very late more near her than I
 :think she wished me. Alone she was and did communicate
S:to herself her own words to her own
 :
S:ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched
 :
 :not any stranger sense. Her matter was she loved
 :
 :your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that
 :
 :had put such difference betwixt their two estates;
 :Love no god, that would not extend his might only
 :where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins,
 :that would suffer her poor knight surprised
 :without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
 :This she delivered in the most bitter touch
S:
 :of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in, which
 :
 :I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,
 :
S:sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns
 :
S:you something to know it.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  You have discharged this honestly. Keep it
 :
 :to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this
S:before, which hung so tott'ring in the balance that
 :
 :I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you
 :
S:leave me. Stall this in your bosom, and I thank you
 :
 :for your honest care. I will speak with you further
 :
 :anon.	[Steward exits.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter Helen.]
 :
S:[Aside.]
 :
 :Even so it was with me when I was young.
 :
 :If ever we are nature's, these are ours. This thorn
 :
 :Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.
 :Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
 :It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
S:Where love's strong passion is impressed in youth.
 :
 :By our remembrances of days foregone,
 :
 :Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
 :
 :Her eye is sick on 't, I observe her now.
 :
 :HELEN  What is your pleasure, madam?
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :Mine honorable mistress.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Nay, a mother.
 :Why not a mother? When I said "a mother,"
S:
 :Methought you saw a serpent. What's in "mother"
 :
 :That you start at it? I say I am your mother
 :
S:And put you in the catalogue of those
 :
 :That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
 :
 :Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
 :
 :A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
 :You ne'er oppressed me with a mother's groan,
 :Yet I express to you a mother's care.
 :God's mercy, maiden, does it curd thy blood
 :To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
 :That this distempered messenger of wet,
S:
S:The many-colored Iris, rounds thine eye?
 :
 :Why? That you are my daughter?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  That I am not.
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :I say I am your mother.
 :
 :HELEN  Pardon, madam.
S:
 :The Count Rossillion cannot be my brother.
 :
S:I am from humble, he from honored name;
 :
 :No note upon my parents, his all noble.
 :
 :My master, my dear lord he is, and I
 :
S:His servant live and will his vassal die.
 :
 :He must not be my brother.
 :
 :
 :
S:COUNTESS  Nor I your mother?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :You are my mother, madam. Would you were--
S:So that my lord your son were not my brother--
 :
 :Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
 :
 :I care no more for than I do for heaven,
 :
 :So I were not his sister. Can 't no other
S:But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
 :God shield you mean it not! "Daughter" and "mother"
 :So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
 :My fear hath catched your fondness! Now I see
 :The mystery of your loneliness and find
 :Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross:
S:
 :You love my son. Invention is ashamed
 :
 :Against the proclamation of thy passion
 :
 :To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true,
 :
S:But tell me then 'tis so, for, look, thy cheeks
 :
 :Confess it th' one to th' other, and thine eyes
 :
 :See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
 :
 :That in their kind they speak it. Only sin
S:And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
 :
 :That truth should be suspected. Speak. Is 't so?
 :
 :If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
 :
 :If it be not, forswear 't; howe'er, I charge thee,
S:As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
 :
 :To tell me truly.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Good madam, pardon me.
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Do you love my son?
 :
 :HELEN  Your pardon, noble mistress.
S:
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
S:Love you my son?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Do not you love him, madam?
 :
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :Go not about. My love hath in 't a bond
 :
 :Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
 :The state of your affection, for your passions
 :Have to the full appeached.
 :
 :HELEN, [kneeling]  Then I confess
 :Here on my knee before high heaven and you
S:
S:That before you and next unto high heaven
 :
 :I love your son.
 :
 :My friends were poor but honest; so 's my love.
 :
S:Be not offended, for it hurts not him
 :
 :That he is loved of me. I follow him not
 :
 :By any token of presumptuous suit,
 :
 :Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,
 :Yet never know how that desert should be.
 :I know I love in vain, strive against hope,
S:Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
 :
 :I still pour in the waters of my love
 :
 :And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
 :
 :Religious in mine error, I adore
S:The sun that looks upon his worshipper
 :
 :But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
 :
 :Let not your hate encounter with my love
 :
 :For loving where you do; but if yourself,
 :Whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth,
 :Did ever in so true a flame of liking
 :Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
 :Was both herself and Love, O then give pity
S:To her whose state is such that cannot choose
 :
 :But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
 :
S:That seeks not to find that her search implies,
 :
 :But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Had you not lately an intent--speak truly--
 :To go to Paris?
 :
 :HELEN  Madam, I had.
 :
S:
 :COUNTESS  Wherefore?
 :
S:Tell true.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN, [standing]
 :
 :I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear.
 :You know my father left me some prescriptions
 :Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
 :And manifest experience had collected
 :For general sovereignty; and that he willed me
 :In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
S:
 :As notes whose faculties inclusive were
 :
 :More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
 :
 :There is a remedy, approved, set down,
 :
S:To cure the desperate languishings whereof
 :
 :The King is rendered lost.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :This was your motive for Paris, was it? Speak.
 :
 :HELEN
 :My lord your son made me to think of this;
 :Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King
S:
 :Had from the conversation of my thoughts
 :
 :Haply been absent then.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  But think you, Helen,
 :If you should tender your supposed aid,
 :He would receive it? He and his physicians
 :Are of a mind: he that they cannot help him,
 :They that they cannot help. How shall they credit
S:
 :A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools
 :
S:Emboweled of their doctrine have left off
 :
 :The danger to itself?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  There's something in 't
 :More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
 :Of his profession, that his good receipt
 :Shall for my legacy be sanctified
 :By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and would your
 :Honor
S:
 :But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
 :
S:The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure
 :
 :By such a day, an hour.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Dost thou believe 't?
 :
 :HELEN  Ay, madam, knowingly.
 :
 :COUNTESS
S:Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
 :
 :Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
 :
S:To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home
 :
 :And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
 :
S:Be gone tomorrow, and be sure of this:
 :
 :What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Flourish cornets. Enter the King, attended, with divers
 :
 :young Lords, taking leave for the Florentine war;
 :Bertram Count Rossillion, and Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Farewell, young lords. These warlike principles
S:
 :Do not throw from you.--And you, my lords,
 :
 :farewell.
 :
 :Share the advice betwixt you. If both gain all,
 :
 :The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received
 :And is enough for both.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  'Tis our hope, sir,
 :After well-entered soldiers, to return
S:
 :And find your Grace in health.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :No, no, it cannot be. And yet my heart
 :Will not confess he owes the malady
 :That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.
 :Whether I live or die, be you the sons
S:Of worthy Frenchmen. Let higher Italy--
 :
 :Those bated that inherit but the fall
 :
 :Of the last monarchy--see that you come
 :
 :Not to woo honor but to wed it. When
 :The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
 :That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :Health at your bidding serve your Majesty!
S:
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
S:Those girls of Italy, take heed of them.
 :
 :They say our French lack language to deny
 :
 :If they demand. Beware of being captives
 :
 :Before you serve.
 :
 :LORDS  Our hearts receive your warnings.
 :
S:KING  Farewell.--Come hither to me.
 :
 :[The King speaks to Attendants, while Bertram,
 :
 :Parolles, and other Lords come forward.]
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [to Bertram]
 :O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
S:
 :
S:PAROLLES
 :
 :'Tis not his fault, the spark.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  O, 'tis brave wars.
 :
 :PAROLLES
 :Most admirable. I have seen those wars.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :I am commanded here and kept a coil
 :
 :With "Too young," and "The next year," and "'Tis
 :too early."
 :
 :PAROLLES
 :An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
 :
S:
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
 :
 :Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry
 :
 :Till honor be bought up, and no sword worn
 :But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away!
 :
 :FIRST LORD
 :There's honor in the theft.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Commit it, count.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD
 :I am your accessory. And so, farewell.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured
 :
 :body.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Farewell, captain.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Sweet Monsieur Parolles.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.
S:
 :Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals.
 :
 :You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one
 :
 :Captain Spurio with his cicatrice, an emblem of
 :
S:war, here on his sinister cheek. It was this very
 :
 :sword entrenched it. Say to him I live, and observe
 :
 :his reports for me.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  We shall, noble captain.
 :
S:PAROLLES  Mars dote on you for his novices.
 :
 :[Lords exit.]
 :
 :[To Bertram.] What will you do?
 :
 :
S:BERTRAM  Stay the King.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble
 :
 :lords. You have restrained yourself within the list
 :of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them,
 :for they wear themselves in the cap of the time;
 :there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move
 :under the influence of the most received star, and,
S:though the devil lead the measure, such are to be
 :
 :followed. After them, and take a more dilated
 :
 :farewell.
 :
 :
S:BERTRAM  And I will do so.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Worthy fellows, and like to prove most
 :
 :sinewy swordmen.	[Bertram and Parolles exit.]
 :
 :[Enter Lafew, to the King.]
 :
 :
S:LAFEW, [kneeling]
 :
 :Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  I'll fee thee to stand up.
 :
 :LAFEW, [standing]
 :Then here's a man stands that has brought his
 :pardon.
 :I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,
S:
 :And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :I would I had, so I had broke thy pate
S:And asked thee mercy for 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Good faith, across.
 :
 :But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cured
 :Of your infirmity?
 :
S:KING  No.
 :
S:
 :
S:LAFEW  O, will you eat
 :
 :No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
 :
 :My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
 :
 :Could reach them. I have seen a medicine
 :That's able to breathe life into a stone,
 :Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
 :With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch
 :Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,
 :To give great Charlemagne a pen in 's hand
S:
S:And write to her a love line.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  What "her" is this?
 :
 :
 :LAFEW
 :Why, Doctor She. My lord, there's one arrived,
 :If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honor,
 :If seriously I may convey my thoughts
 :In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
S:
S:With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
 :
S:Wisdom, and constancy hath amazed me more
 :
 :Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her--
 :
 :For that is her demand--and know her business?
 :
 :That done, laugh well at me.
 :
 :KING  Now, good Lafew,
 :Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
 :May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
S:By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Nay, I'll fit you,
 :
 :And not be all day neither.
S:[He goes to bring in Helen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
 :
 :[Enter Helen.]
 :
 :
 :LAFEW, [to Helen]  Nay, come your ways.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING  This haste hath wings indeed.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Nay, come your ways.
 :This is his Majesty. Say your mind to him.
 :A traitor you do look like, but such traitors
 :His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle
 :That dare leave two together. Fare you well.
S:
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
 :
 :HELEN  Ay, my good lord,
 :Gerard de Narbon was my father,
S:In what he did profess well found.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  I knew him.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :The rather will I spare my praises towards him.
 :Knowing him is enough. On 's bed of death
 :Many receipts he gave me, chiefly one
S:Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
 :
 :And of his old experience th' only darling,
 :
 :He bade me store up as a triple eye,
 :
 :Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,
 :And hearing your high Majesty is touched
 :With that malignant cause wherein the honor
 :Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
 :I come to tender it and my appliance
 :With all bound humbleness.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING  We thank you, maiden,
 :
 :But may not be so credulous of cure,
 :
S:When our most learned doctors leave us and
 :
 :The congregated college have concluded
 :
 :That laboring art can never ransom nature
 :
 :From her inaidible estate. I say we must not
 :So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
 :To prostitute our past-cure malady
S:To empirics, or to dissever so
 :
 :Our great self and our credit to esteem
 :
 :A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
S:My duty, then, shall pay me for my pains.
 :
 :I will no more enforce mine office on you,
 :
 :Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
 :
 :A modest one to bear me back again.
 :
 :KING
 :I cannot give thee less, to be called grateful.
 :Thou thought'st to help me, and such thanks I give
 :As one near death to those that wish him live.
S:
 :But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
 :
 :I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
S:What I can do can do no hurt to try
 :
 :Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
 :
 :He that of greatest works is finisher
 :
 :Oft does them by the weakest minister.
S:So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
 :
S:When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
 :
 :From simple sources, and great seas have dried
 :
 :When miracles have by the great'st been denied.
 :
 :Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
 :Where most it promises, and oft it hits
S:Where hope is coldest and despair most shifts.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING
 :
 :I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.
 :
 :Thy pains, not used, must by thyself be paid.
 :
 :Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
 :
 :HELEN
 :Inspired merit so by breath is barred.
 :It is not so with Him that all things knows
 :As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
S:
 :But most it is presumption in us when
 :
 :The help of heaven we count the act of men.
 :
 :Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent.
 :
 :Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
 :I am not an impostor that proclaim
S:Myself against the level of mine aim,
 :
 :But know I think and think I know most sure
 :
 :My art is not past power nor you past cure.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Art thou so confident? Within what space
S:Hop'st thou my cure?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  The greatest grace lending grace,
 :
 :Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
S:Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring;
 :
 :Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
 :
 :Moist Hesperus hath quenched her sleepy lamp;
 :
 :Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
S:Hath told the thievish minutes, how they pass,
 :
 :What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
 :
S:Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
S:Upon thy certainty and confidence
 :
 :What dar'st thou venture?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Tax of impudence,
 :A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame;
 :Traduced by odious ballads, my maiden's name
 :Seared otherwise; nay, worse of worst, extended
 :With vilest torture let my life be ended.
 :
S:
 :KING
 :
 :Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
 :
S:His powerful sound within an organ weak,
 :
 :And what impossibility would slay
 :
 :In common sense, sense saves another way.
 :
 :Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate
S:Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
 :
 :Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
 :
 :That happiness and prime can happy call.
 :
S:Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
 :
 :Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
 :
S:Sweet practicer, thy physic I will try,
 :
 :That ministers thine own death if I die.
 :
 :
 :
S:HELEN
 :
 :If I break time or flinch in property
 :
 :Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
 :
 :And well deserved. Not helping, death's my fee.
 :But if I help, what do you promise me?
 :
 :KING
 :Make thy demand.
 :
S:
 :HELEN  But will you make it even?
 :
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
 :Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
 :What husband in thy power I will command.
 :Exempted be from me the arrogance
S:To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
 :
 :My low and humble name to propagate
 :
 :With any branch or image of thy state;
 :
 :But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
S:Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :Here is my hand. The premises observed,
 :Thy will by my performance shall be served.
 :So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
 :Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
 :More should I question thee, and more I must,
 :Though more to know could not be more to trust:
S:
 :From whence thou cam'st, how tended on; but rest
 :
S:Unquestioned welcome and undoubted blessed.--
 :
 :Give me some help here, ho!--If thou proceed
 :
 :As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.

 :"But to the court"?
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,
 :
 :he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot
 :
 :make a leg, put off 's cap, kiss his hand, and
 :
 :say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;
 :and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were
 :not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer
 :will serve all men.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
S:
 :questions.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks:
 :
 :the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock,
 :
 :or any buttock.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
 :
 :FOOL  As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
 :as your French crown for your taffety punk, as
S:
 :Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for
 :
 :Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May Day, as the nail
 :
 :to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
 :
 :quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
 :friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
S:
 :
S:COUNTESS  Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness
 :
 :for all questions?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  From below your duke to beneath your constable,
 :it will fit any question.
 :
 :COUNTESS  It must be an answer of most monstrous
 :size that must fit all demands.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
 :
 :should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that
 :
 :belongs to 't. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do
 :
 :you no harm to learn.
 :
 :COUNTESS  To be young again, if we could! I will be a
 :fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your
 :answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O Lord, sir!--There's a simple putting off. More,
 :
 :more, a hundred of them.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Sir, I am a poor friend of yours that loves
 :you.
 :
 :FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Thick, thick. Spare not me.
S:
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely
 :
 :meat.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Nay, put me to 't, I warrant you.
 :
S:COUNTESS  You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Spare not me.
 :
 :
S:COUNTESS  Do you cry "O Lord, sir!" at your whipping,
 :
 :and "spare not me"? Indeed your "O Lord, sir!" is
 :
 :very sequent to your whipping. You would answer
 :
 :very well to a whipping if you were but bound to 't.
 :
 :FOOL  I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my "O Lord,
 :sir!" I see things may serve long but not serve ever.
 :
 :COUNTESS  I play the noble huswife with the time to
S:
 :entertain it so merrily with a fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Why, there 't serves well again.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS, [giving him a paper]
 :An end, sir. To your business. Give Helen this,
 :And urge her to a present answer back.
S:Commend me to my kinsmen and my son.
 :
 :This is not much.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Not much commendation to them?
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :Not much employment for you. You understand me.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Most fruitfully. I am there before my legs.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Haste you again.

 :Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Count Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  They say miracles are past, and we have our
 :philosophical persons to make modern and familiar
S:
 :things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it
 :
 :that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
 :
 :into seeming knowledge when we should
 :
 :submit ourselves to an unknown fear.
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that
 :
S:hath shot out in our latter times.
 :
 :
 :
S:BERTRAM  And so 'tis.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  To be relinquished of the artists--
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  So I say, both of Galen and Paracelsus.
 :
 :LAFEW  Of all the learned and authentic fellows--
 :
 :PAROLLES  Right, so I say.
 :
S:
 :LAFEW  That gave him out incurable--
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why, there 'tis. So say I too.
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Not to be helped.
 :
S:PAROLLES  Right, as 'twere a man assured of a--
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Uncertain life and sure death.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Just. You say well. So would I have said.
 :
 :LAFEW  I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
 :
 :PAROLLES  It is indeed. If you will have it in showing,
S:
 :you shall read it in what-do-you-call there.
 :
S:[He points to a paper in Lafew's hand.]
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW [reads]  A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly
 :
 :actor.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  That's it. I would have said the very same.
 :
 :LAFEW  Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I
 :speak in respect--
 :
S:
S:PAROLLES  Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the
 :
 :brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinorous
 :
 :spirit that will not acknowledge it to be
 :
 :the--
 :
 :LAFEW  Very hand of heaven.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Ay, so I say.
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  In a most weak--
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  And debile minister. Great power, great
 :
 :transcendence, which should indeed give us a further
 :
 :use to be made than alone the recov'ry of the
 :
 :King, as to be--
 :
S:LAFEW  Generally thankful.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter King, Helen, and Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I would have said it. You say well. Here
 :comes the King.
 :
 :LAFEW  Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid
S:
 :the better whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why,
 :
 :he's able to lead her a coranto.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  'Fore God, I think so.
 :
 :
S:KING
 :
 :Go, call before me all the lords in court.
 :
 :[An Attendant exits.]
 :
S:Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side,
 :
 :And with this healthful hand, whose banished sense
 :
 :Thou hast repealed, a second time receive
 :
 :The confirmation of my promised gift,
 :Which but attends thy naming.
S:
 :
 :[Enter three or four Court Lords.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
 :Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
 :O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
 :I have to use. Thy frank election make.
 :Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
 :
S:
 :HELEN
 :
S:To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
 :
 :Fall when Love please! Marry, to each but one.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW, [aside]
 :
 :I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
 :
 :My mouth no more were broken than these boys'
 :And writ as little beard.
 :
 :KING  Peruse them well.
 :Not one of those but had a noble father.
 :
S:
 :HELEN  Gentlemen,
 :
 :Heaven hath through me restored the King to health.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL
 :We understand it and thank heaven for you.
 :
 :HELEN
 :I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
S:
 :That I protest I simply am a maid.--
 :
S:Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
 :
 :The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
 :
 :"We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be
 :
 :refused,
 :Let the white death sit on thy cheek forever;
 :We'll ne'er come there again."
S:
 :
 :KING  Make choice and see.
 :
 :Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
 :And to imperial Love, that god most high,
 :Do my sighs stream.	[She addresses her to a Lord.]
S:Sir, will you hear my suit?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST COURT LORD
 :
 :And grant it.
 :
 :HELEN  Thanks, sir. All the
 :rest is mute.
 :
 :LAFEW, [aside]  I had rather be in this choice than
S:
 :throw ambs-ace for my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN, [to another Lord]
 :
 :The honor, sir, that flames in your fair eyes
 :Before I speak too threat'ningly replies.
 :Love make your fortunes twenty times above
 :Her that so wishes, and her humble love.
S:
 :
 :SECOND COURT LORD
 :
 :No better, if you please.
 :
 :
 :HELEN  My wish receive,
 :Which great Love grant, and so I take my leave.
 :
 :LAFEW, [aside]  Do all they deny her? An they were sons
 :of mine, I'd have them whipped, or I would send
S:
 :them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN, [to another Lord]
 :
 :Be not afraid that I your hand should take.
 :I'll never do you wrong, for your own sake.
 :Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed
 :Find fairer fortune if you ever wed.
 :
S:
 :LAFEW, [aside]  These boys are boys of ice; they'll none
 :
 :have her. Sure they are bastards to the English;
 :
 :the French ne'er got 'em.
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN, [to another Lord]
 :
 :You are too young, too happy, and too good
 :
S:To make yourself a son out of my blood.
 :
S:
 :
S:FOURTH COURT LORD  Fair one, I think not so.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW, [aside]  There's one grape yet. I am sure thy
 :
 :father drunk wine. But if thou be'st not an ass, I
 :am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.
S:
 :
 :HELEN, [to Bertram]
 :
 :I dare not say I take you, but I give
 :
 :Me and my service ever whilst I live
 :Into your guiding power.--This is the man.
 :
S:KING
 :
 :Why then, young Bertram, take her. She's thy wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your Highness
 :In such a business give me leave to use
 :The help of mine own eyes.
 :
 :KING  Know'st thou not,
S:
 :Bertram,
 :
 :What she has done for me?
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Yes, my good lord,
 :But never hope to know why I should marry her.
 :
 :KING
 :Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
S:
 :
 :
S:BERTRAM
 :
 :But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
 :
 :Must answer for your raising? I know her well;
 :
 :She had her breeding at my father's charge.
 :A poor physician's daughter my wife? Disdain
 :Rather corrupt me ever!
 :
 :KING
 :'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
S:
 :I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
 :
 :Of color, weight, and heat, poured all together,
 :
S:Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off
 :
 :In differences so mighty. If she be
 :
 :All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik'st--
 :
 :"A poor physician's daughter"--thou dislik'st
 :Of virtue for the name. But do not so.
 :From lowest place whence virtuous things proceed,
 :The place is dignified by th' doer's deed.
S:Where great additions swell 's, and virtue none,
 :
 :It is a dropsied honor. Good alone
 :
 :Is good, without a name; vileness is so;
 :
 :The property by what it is should go,
S:Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
 :
 :In these to nature she's immediate heir,
 :
 :And these breed honor. That is honor's scorn
 :
 :Which challenges itself as honor's born
 :And is not like the sire. Honors thrive
 :When rather from our acts we them derive
 :Than our foregoers. The mere word's a slave
 :Debauched on every tomb, on every grave
 :A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
S:
 :Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb
 :
 :Of honored bones indeed. What should be said?
 :
 :If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
 :
 :I can create the rest. Virtue and she
 :Is her own dower, honor and wealth from me.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to
 :choose.
 :
 :HELEN
S:
 :That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad.
 :
S:Let the rest go.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :My honor's at the stake, which to defeat
 :I must produce my power.--Here, take her hand,
 :Proud, scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
 :That dost in vile misprision shackle up
 :My love and her desert; that canst not dream
 :We, poising us in her defective scale,
S:
 :Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
 :
S:It is in us to plant thine honor where
 :
S:We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
 :
 :Obey our will, which travails in thy good.
 :
 :Believe not thy disdain, but presently
 :
S:Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
 :
 :Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,
 :
 :Or I will throw thee from my care forever
 :
 :Into the staggers and the careless lapse
 :Of youth and ignorance, both my revenge and hate
 :Loosing upon thee in the name of justice
S:Without all terms of pity. Speak. Thine answer.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit
 :My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
S:What great creation and what dole of honor
 :
 :Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
 :
 :Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
 :
S:The praised of the King, who, so ennobled,
 :
 :Is as 'twere born so.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING  Take her by the hand,
 :
 :And tell her she is thine, to whom I promise
 :
 :A counterpoise, if not to thy estate,
 :A balance more replete.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  I take her hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Good fortune and the favor of the King
 :Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony
 :Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief
 :And be performed tonight. The solemn feast
 :Shall more attend upon the coming space,
S:
 :Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her
 :
 :Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
 :
 :[They exit. Parolles and Lafew stay behind,
 :
 :commenting of this wedding.]
 :
 :LAFEW  Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Your pleasure, sir.
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Your lord and master did well to make his
 :
 :recantation.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  "Recantation"? My "lord"? My "master"?
 :
 :LAFEW  Ay. Is it not a language I speak?
 :
S:
 :PAROLLES  A most harsh one, and not to be understood
 :
 :without bloody succeeding. My "master"?
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Are you companion to the Count Rossillion?
 :
 :PAROLLES  To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
 :
 :LAFEW  To what is count's man. Count's master is of
S:
 :another style.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are
 :
S:too old.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which
 :
 :title age cannot bring thee.
 :
 :PAROLLES  What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
 :
 :LAFEW  I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a
 :pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent
S:
 :of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarves and the
 :
 :bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me
 :
 :from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden.
 :
 :I have now found thee. When I lose thee again, I
 :care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking
 :up, and that thou 'rt scarce worth.
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity
 :
 :upon thee--
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou
 :hasten thy trial, which if--Lord have mercy on
 :thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare
 :thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look
 :through thee. Give me thy hand.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  My lord, you give me most egregious
 :
 :indignity.
 :
 :
S:LAFEW  Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I have not, my lord, deserved it.
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it, and I will not
 :bate thee a scruple.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Well, I shall be wiser.
 :
S:
 :LAFEW  Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to
 :
 :pull at a smack o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st
 :
S:bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find
 :
 :what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a
 :
 :desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or
 :
 :rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default
 :"He is a man I know."
 :
 :PAROLLES  My lord, you do me most insupportable
 :vexation.
 :
S:
 :LAFEW  I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my
 :
 :poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by
 :
 :thee in what motion age will give me leave.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :PAROLLES  Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace
S:off me. Scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
 :
 :be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I'll
 :
 :beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any
 :
S:convenience, an he were double and double a lord.
 :
 :I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have
 :
 :of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Lafew.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:LAFEW  Sirrah, your lord and master's married. There's
 :
 :news for you: you have a new mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I most unfeignedly beseech your Lordship
 :to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is
S:my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Who? God?
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Ay, sir.
 :
 :LAFEW  The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
 :garter up thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose
S:of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert
 :
 :best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By
 :
 :mine honor, if I were but two hours younger, I'd
 :
 :beat thee. Methink'st thou art a general offense,
 :and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast
 :created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
 :
 :PAROLLES  This is hard and undeserved measure, my
 :lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Go to, sir. You were beaten in Italy for picking a
 :
 :kernel out of a pomegranate. You are a vagabond,
 :
 :and no true traveler. You are more saucy with
 :lords and honorable personages than the commission
 :of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.
 :You are not worth another word; else I'd call you
 :knave. I leave you.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Good, very good! It is so, then. Good, very
 :
 :good. Let it be concealed awhile.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!
 :
S:PAROLLES  What's the matter, sweetheart?
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
S:I will not bed her.
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  What, what, sweetheart?
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :O my Parolles, they have married me!
 :I'll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.
 :
 :PAROLLES  France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
S:the tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  There's letters from my mother. What th'
 :
 :import is I know not yet.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my
 :boy, to th' wars!
 :He wears his honor in a box unseen
 :That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
S:
S:Spending his manly marrow in her arms
 :
 :Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
 :
 :Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
 :
S:France is a stable, we that dwell in 't jades.
 :
 :Therefore, to th' war!
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :It shall be so. I'll send her to my house,
 :Acquaint my mother with my hate to her
 :And wherefore I am fled, write to the King
 :That which I durst not speak. His present gift
 :Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
S:
 :Where noble fellows strike. Wars is no strife
 :
 :To the dark house and the detested wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES
 :Will this capriccio hold in thee? Art sure?
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
S:
 :I'll send her straight away. Tomorrow
 :
S:I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES
 :
 :Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard.
 :
 :A young man married is a man that's marred.
 :
 :Therefore away, and leave her bravely. Go.
 :The King has done you wrong, but hush, 'tis so.

 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Helen with a paper, and Fool.]
S:
 :
S:
 :
S:HELEN  My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  She is not well, but yet she has her health. She's
 :
 :very merry, but yet she is not well. But, thanks be
 :
 :given, she's very well and wants nothing i' th' world,
 :but yet she is not well.
 :
 :HELEN  If she be very well, what does she ail that she's
S:not very well?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
 :
 :
 :HELEN  What two things?
 :
 :FOOL  One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send
 :her quickly; the other, that she's in Earth, from
 :whence God send her quickly.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Bless you, my fortunate lady.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine
 :own good fortunes.
 :
 :PAROLLES  You had my prayers to lead them on, and to
 :keep them on have them still.--O my knave, how
S:does my old lady?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I
 :
 :would she did as you say.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why, I say nothing.
 :
 :FOOL  Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man's
S:tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say
 :
 :nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to
 :
 :have nothing is to be a great part of your title,
 :
 :which is within a very little of nothing.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Away. Thou 'rt a knave.
 :
 :FOOL  You should have said, sir, "Before a knave,
 :thou 'rt a knave"; that's "Before me, thou 'rt a
S:
 :knave." This had been truth, sir.
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Go to. Thou art a witty fool. I have found
 :
 :thee.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you
 :taught to find me?
 :
S:PAROLLES  ...
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool
 :
 :may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure
 :and the increase of laughter.
 :
 :PAROLLES  A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
 :Madam, my lord will go away tonight;
 :A very serious business calls on him.
S:
 :The great prerogative and rite of love,
 :
 :Which as your due time claims, he does acknowledge
 :

 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  But I hope your Lordship thinks not him a
S:soldier.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  You have it from his own deliverance.
 :
 :BERTRAM  And by other warranted testimony.
 :
 :LAFEW  Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for
S:
 :a bunting.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
 :
 :knowledge and accordingly valiant.
 :
S:LAFEW  I have then sinned against his experience and
 :
S:transgressed against his valor, and my state that
 :
 :way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my
 :
 :heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you make us
 :
 :friends. I will pursue the amity.
 :
S:[Enter Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES, [to Bertram]  These things shall be done, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW, [to Bertram]  Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
 :
 :PAROLLES  Sir?
 :
 :LAFEW  O, I know him well. Ay, sir, he, sir, 's a good
 :workman, a very good tailor.
S:
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside to Parolles]  Is she gone to the King?
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  She is.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Will she away tonight?
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  As you'll have her.
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
 :Given order for our horses, and tonight,
S:
 :When I should take possession of the bride,
 :
 :End ere I do begin.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW, [aside]  A good traveler is something at the latter
 :end of a dinner, but one that lies three thirds,
 :and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings
 :with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.--
S:God save you, captain.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [to Parolles]  Is there any unkindness
 :
 :between my lord and you, monsieur?
 :
 :PAROLLES  I know not how I have deserved to run into
 :my lord's displeasure.
 :
 :LAFEW  You have made shift to run into 't, boots and
S:
 :spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard;
 :
 :and out of it you'll run again rather than suffer
 :
 :question for your residence.
 :
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
 :prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this of
 :me: there can be no kernel in this light nut. The
 :soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
 :matter of heavy consequence. I have kept of them
S:tame and know their natures.--Farewell, monsieur.
 :
 :I have spoken better of you than you have or
 :
 :will to deserve at my hand, but we must do good
 :
 :against evil.	[He exits.]
 :
 :PAROLLES  An idle lord, I swear.
 :
S:BERTRAM  I think not so.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Why, do you not know him?
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
 :Gives him a worthy pass.
 :
 :[Enter Helen.]
S:
 :
 :
 :Here comes my clog.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
S:I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
 :
 :Spoke with the King and have procured his leave
 :
 :For present parting. Only he desires
 :
 :Some private speech with you.
 :
 :BERTRAM  I shall obey his will.
 :You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
 :Which holds not color with the time, nor does
 :The ministration and required office
S:
S:On my particular. Prepared I was not
 :
S:For such a business; therefore am I found
 :
 :So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
 :
 :That presently you take your way for home,
 :
 :And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
 :For my respects are better than they seem,
 :And my appointments have in them a need
 :Greater than shows itself at the first view
 :To you that know them not.	[Giving her a paper.]
 :This to my mother.
S:
 :'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
 :
S:I leave you to your wisdom.
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN  Sir, I can nothing say
 :
 :But that I am your most obedient servant--
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :Come, come, no more of that.
 :
 :HELEN  And ever shall
 :With true observance seek to eke out that
S:
 :Wherein toward me my homely stars have failed
 :
 :To equal my great fortune.
 :
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  Let that go.
 :
 :My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home.
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :Pray, sir, your pardon.
 :
 :BERTRAM  Well, what would you say?
S:
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
 :
 :Nor dare I say 'tis mine--and yet it is--
S:But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
 :
 :What law does vouch mine own.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  What would you have?
 :
 :HELEN
S:Something, and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
 :
 :I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith,
 :
 :yes:
 :
 :Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
 :
 :BERTRAM
S:I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.--
 :Where are my other men?--Monsieur, farewell.
 :[She exits.]
 :
 :BERTRAM
S:Go thou toward home, where I will never come
 :
 :Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.--
 :
 :Away, and for our flight.

 :=======
S:
 :[Enter Countess, with a paper, and Fool.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  It hath happened all as I would have had it,
 :save that he comes not along with her.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
 :
S:melancholy man.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  By what observance, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Why, he will look upon his boot and sing, mend
 :the ruff and sing, ask questions and sing, pick his
 :teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
 :melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
 :
S:
S:COUNTESS  Let me see what he writes and when he
 :
 :means to come.	[She opens the letter.]
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our
 :
S:old lings and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing
 :
 :like your old ling and your Isbels o' th' court. The
 :
 :brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
 :
 :love as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
 :
 :COUNTESS  What have we here?
 :
S:FOOL  E'en that you have there.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS [reads.]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law.
 :
 :She hath recovered the King and undone me. I have
 :wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the
 :"not" eternal. You shall hear I am run away. Know it
 :before the report come. If there be breadth enough in
 :the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to
 :you.
S:
 :Your unfortunate son,
 :
 :Bertram.
 :
 :This is not well, rash and unbridled boy:
 :
S:To fly the favors of so good a king,
 :
S:To pluck his indignation on thy head
 :
 :By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
 :
 :For the contempt of empire.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Fool.]
 :
 :
S:FOOL  O madam, yonder is heavy news within, between
 :
 :two soldiers and my young lady.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  What is the matter?
 :
 :FOOL  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
 :comfort. Your son will not be killed so soon as I
 :thought he would.
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS  Why should he be killed?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he
 :does. The danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss
 :of men, though it be the getting of children. Here
S:they come will tell you more. For my part, I only
 :
 :hear your son was run away.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Helen, with a paper, and two Gentlemen.]
 :
 :

 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN, [to Countess]  Save you, good
 :madam.
 :
S:HELEN
 :
S:Madam, my lord is gone, forever gone.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Do not say so.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Think upon patience, pray you.--Gentlemen,
 :I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
 :That the first face of neither on the start
S:Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :
 :Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
 :We met him thitherward, for thence we came,
S:And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
 :
 :Thither we bend again.
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN
 :
 :Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
 :
S:[She reads.] When thou canst get the ring upon
 :
 :my finger, which never shall come off, and show me
 :
S:a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then
 :
 :call me husband. But in such a "then" I write a
 :
 :"never."
 :
 :This is a dreadful sentence.
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Ay, madam,
S:
 :And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
S:I prithee, lady, have a better cheer.
 :
 :If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
 :
 :Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son,
 :
 :But I do wash his name out of my blood,
 :And thou art all my child.--Towards Florence is he?
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  Ay, madam.
 :
 :COUNTESS  And to be a soldier?
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN
 :
 :Such is his noble purpose, and, believe 't,
 :
 :The Duke will lay upon him all the honor
 :That good convenience claims.
 :
 :COUNTESS  Return you thither?
 :
S:
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN [reads]
 :Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
 :'Tis bitter.
 :
S:COUNTESS  Find you that there?
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Ay, madam.
 :
S:
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,
 :
 :Which his heart was not consenting to.
 :
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :Nothing in France until he have no wife!
 :
 :There's nothing here that is too good for him
 :But only she, and she deserves a lord
 :That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
 :And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
 :
S:FIRST GENTLEMAN
 :
 :A servant only, and a gentleman
 :
 :Which I have sometime known.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Parolles was it not?
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Ay, my good lady, he.
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
 :
 :My son corrupts a well-derived nature
 :With his inducement.
 :
 :FIRST GENTLEMAN  Indeed, good lady,
 :The fellow has a deal of that too much
 :Which holds him much to have.
S:
 :
 :
S:COUNTESS  You're welcome,
 :
 :gentlemen.
 :
 :I will entreat you when you see my son
 :
 :To tell him that his sword can never win
 :The honor that he loses. More I'll entreat you
 :Written to bear along.
 :
 :SECOND GENTLEMAN  We serve you, madam,
 :In that and all your worthiest affairs.
S:
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS
 :
 :Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
 :
 :Will you draw near?
 :[She exits with the Gentlemen.]
 :
 :HELEN
 :"Till I have no wife I have nothing in France."
S:
 :Nothing in France until he has no wife.
 :
 :Thou shalt have none, Rossillion, none in France.
 :
 :Then hast thou all again. Poor lord, is 't I
 :
S:That chase thee from thy country and expose
 :
 :Those tender limbs of thine to the event
 :
 :Of the none-sparing war? And is it I
 :
 :That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
 :Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
 :Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers
 :That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
 :Fly with false aim; move the still-'pearing air
S:That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
 :
 :Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
 :
S:Whoever charges on his forward breast,
 :
 :I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't;
 :
 :And though I kill him not, I am the cause
 :
 :His death was so effected. Better 'twere
 :I met the ravin lion when he roared
 :With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
 :That all the miseries which nature owes
S:Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rossillion,
 :
 :Whence honor but of danger wins a scar,
 :
 :As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
 :
S:My being here it is that holds thee hence.
 :
 :Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
 :
 :The air of paradise did fan the house
 :
 :And angels officed all. I will be gone,
 :That pitiful rumor may report my flight
 :To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;
 :For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

S:In argument of praise, or to the worth
 :
S:Of the great count himself, she is too mean
 :
 :To have her name repeated. All her deserving
 :
 :Is a reserved honesty, and that

S:I have not heard examined.
 :

 :
 :DIANA  Alas, poor lady,
 :
 :'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife

 :I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
 :Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do
S:

 :
 :A shrewd turn if she pleased.
 :
 :
 :
S:HELEN, [as pilgrim]  How do you mean?
 :
 :Maybe the amorous count solicits her
 :
 :In the unlawful purpose?
 :

 :WIDOW  He does indeed,
 :And brokes with all that can in such a suit
 :Corrupt the tender honor of a maid,

S:In honestest defense.

S:Scene 6
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion and the French
 :
 :Lords, as at first.]
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Nay, good my lord, put him to 't. Let him
 :have his way.
 :
S:
 :SECOND LORD  If your Lordship find him not a hilding,
 :
S:hold me no more in your respect.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  On my life, my lord, a bubble.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Believe it, my lord. In mine own direct
 :knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of
 :him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward,
S:
 :an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker,
 :
 :the owner of no one good quality worthy
 :
 :your Lordship's entertainment.
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing
 :too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might
 :at some great and trusty business in a main danger
S:fail you.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  I would I knew in what particular action to
 :
 :try him.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  None better than to let him fetch off his
 :drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake
 :to do.
 :
S:
 :FIRST LORD  I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
 :
 :surprise him. Such I will have whom I am sure
 :
 :he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and
 :
 :hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other
 :but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversary's
S:when we bring him to our own tents. Be but
 :
 :your Lordship present at his examination. If he do
 :
 :not for the promise of his life, and in the highest
 :
 :compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
 :deliver all the intelligence in his power against
 :you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul
 :upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch
S:
 :his drum. He says he has a stratagem for 't. When
 :
 :your Lordship sees the bottom of his success in
 :
 :'t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore
 :
 :will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
 :entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
 :Here he comes.
 :
 :[Enter Parolles.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  O, for the love of laughter,
 :
S:hinder not the honor of his design. Let him
 :
 :fetch off his drum in any hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [to Parolles]  How now, monsieur? This
 :drum sticks sorely in your disposition.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  A pox on 't! Let it go. 'Tis but a drum.
 :
 :PAROLLES  But a drum! Is 't but a drum? A drum so
S:
 :lost! There was excellent command, to charge in
 :
 :with our horse upon our own wings and to rend
 :
 :our own soldiers!
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  That was not to be blamed in the command
 :of the service. It was a disaster of war that
 :Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had
 :been there to command.
S:
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
 :
 :Some dishonor we had in the loss of that
 :
 :drum, but it is not to be recovered.
 :
S:PAROLLES  It might have been recovered.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  It might, but it is not now.
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  It is to be recovered. But that the merit of
 :
 :service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
 :
 :performer, I would have that drum or another, or
 :
 :hic jacet.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  Why, if you have a stomach, to 't, monsieur!
 :
 :If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring
 :
 :this instrument of honor again into his native
 :quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go
 :on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If
 :you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it
 :and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,
 :even to the utmost syllable of your
S:
 :worthiness.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  But you must not now slumber in it.
 :
S:PAROLLES  I'll about it this evening, and I will presently
 :
 :pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
 :
 :certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
 :
 :and by midnight look to hear further from me.
 :
S:BERTRAM  May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are
 :
 :gone about it?
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  I know not what the success will be, my
 :
 :lord, but the attempt I vow.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  I know thou 'rt valiant, and to the possibility
 :of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
 :
 :PAROLLES  I love not many words.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :FIRST LORD  No more than a fish loves water. Is not this
 :
 :a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
 :
 :to undertake this business which he knows is not
 :
 :to be done, damns himself to do, and dares better
S:be damned than to do 't?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  You do not know him, my lord, as we do.
 :
 :Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's
 :favor and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries,
S:but when you find him out, you have him
 :
 :ever after.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Why, do you think he will make no deed at
 :all of this that so seriously he does address himself
 :unto?
 :
 :FIRST LORD  None in the world, but return with an
S:invention and clap upon you two or three probable
 :
S:lies. But we have almost embossed him. You shall
 :
 :see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your
 :
 :Lordship's respect.
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  We'll make you some sport with the fox
 :ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old
 :Lord Lafew. When his disguise and he is parted,
S:tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you
 :
 :shall see this very night.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  I must go look my twigs. He shall be
S:caught.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Your brother he shall go along with me.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  As 't please your Lordship. I'll leave you.
S:[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
S:Now will I lead you to the house and show you
 :
 :The lass I spoke of.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND LORD  But you say she's honest.
 :
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once
 :
 :And found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her,
S:By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
 :
 :Tokens and letters, which she did re-send.
 :
 :And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature.
 :
S:Will you go see her?
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND LORD  With all my heart, my lord.

 :If you misdoubt me that I am not she,

 :
 :But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
 :
 :WIDOW
 :Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
 :Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
S:
 :And would not put my reputation now
 :
 :In any staining act.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Nor would I wish you.
 :First give me trust the Count he is my husband,
 :And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
 :Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
 :By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
S:
 :Err in bestowing it.
 :
 :
 :
 :WIDOW  I should believe you,
 :
 :For you have showed me that which well approves
 :You're great in fortune.
 :
 :HELEN  Take this purse of gold,
 :And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
S:
 :Which I will overpay and pay again
 :

 :
S:daughter,
 :
 :Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
 :
 :Resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent
 :
 :As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
 :Now his important blood will naught deny
 :That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
 :That downward hath succeeded in his house
 :From son to son some four or five descents
 :Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
S:
S:In most rich choice. Yet, in his idle fire,
 :
 :To buy his will it would not seem too dear,
 :
 :Howe'er repented after.
 :
 :
S:WIDOW
 :
 :Now I see the bottom of your purpose.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
 :You see it lawful, then. It is no more
 :But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
 :Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,
 :In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
 :Herself most chastely absent. After,
S:
 :To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
 :
 :To what is passed already.
 :
 :
 :
S:WIDOW  I have yielded.
 :
 :Instruct my daughter how she shall persever
 :
 :That time and place with this deceit so lawful
 :
 :May prove coherent. Every night he comes
 :With musics of all sorts and songs composed
 :To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
 :To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
 :As if his life lay on 't.
 :
S:
 :HELEN  Why then tonight
 :
 :Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,
 :
 :Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
 :
S:And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
 :
 :Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.

 :[Enter one of the French Lords, with five or six other
 :Soldiers in ambush.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD  He can come no other way but by this hedge
 :
 :corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
 :language you will. Though you understand it
 :not yourselves, no matter. For we must not seem to
 :understand him, unless some one among us whom
S:we must produce for an interpreter.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
 :
S:
 :
 :LORD  Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy
 :
 :voice?
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  No, sir, I warrant you.
S:
 :
 :LORD  But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to
 :
 :us again?
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  E'en such as you speak to me.
 :
 :LORD  He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
 :adversary's entertainment. Now, he hath a smack
S:of all neighboring languages. Therefore we must
 :
 :every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know
 :
 :what we speak one to another. So we seem to know
 :
 :is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
 :gabble enough and good enough. As for
 :you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But
 :couch, ho! Here he comes to beguile two hours in
 :a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he
 :forges.	[They move aside.]
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill
 :
 :be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
 :
 :done? It must be a very plausive invention that
 :carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces
 :have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
 :my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the
 :fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not
S:daring the reports of my tongue.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD, [aside]  This is the first truth that e'er thine own
 :
 :tongue was guilty of.
 :
 :PAROLLES  What the devil should move me to undertake
S:the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant
 :
 :of the impossibility and knowing I had no such
 :
 :purpose? I must give myself some hurts and say I
 :
 :got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
 :They will say "Came you off with so little?" And
 :great ones I dare not give. Wherefore? What's the
S:instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman's
 :
 :mouth and buy myself another of
 :
 :Bajazeth's mule if you prattle me into these perils.
 :
 :
 :LORD, [aside]  Is it possible he should know what he is,
 :and be that he is?
 :
 :PAROLLES  I would the cutting of my garments would
S:serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish
 :
 :sword.
 :
 :

S:When you are dead, you should be such a one

S:

 :DIANA  Ay, so you serve us
 :
 :Till we serve you. But when you have our roses,
 :
 :You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
 :And mock us with our bareness.

 :BERTRAM  How have I sworn!

S:DIANA
 :
 :'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,

 :
 :What is not holy, that we swear not by,
 :But take the high'st to witness. Then pray you, tell

S:If I should swear by Jove's great attributes

 :I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths

 :or three Soldiers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  You have not given him his mother's
S:letter?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  I have delivered it an hour since. There
 :
 :is something in 't that stings his nature, for on the
S:reading it he changed almost into another man.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  He has much worthy blame laid upon him
 :
 :for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
 :
S:SECOND LORD  Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
 :
 :displeasure of the King, who had even tuned
 :
 :his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you
 :
 :a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I
 :am the grave of it.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  He hath perverted a young gentlewoman
S:
 :here in Florence of a most chaste renown,
 :
 :and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her
 :
S:honor. He hath given her his monumental ring and
 :
 :thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Now God delay our rebellion! As we are
 :ourselves, what things are we!
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Merely our own traitors. And, as in the
 :common course of all treasons we still see them
 :reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred
S:
 :ends, so he that in this action contrives against his
 :
 :own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows
 :
 :himself.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters
 :of our unlawful intents? We shall not, then,
 :have his company tonight?
S:
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to
 :
 :his hour.
 :
 :
S:FIRST LORD  That approaches apace. I would gladly
 :
 :have him see his company anatomized, that he
 :
 :might take a measure of his own judgments
 :
 :wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  We will not meddle with him till he
 :come, for his presence must be the whip of the
 :other.
 :
S:
 :FIRST LORD  In the meantime, what hear you of these
 :
 :wars?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  I hear there is an overture of peace.
 :
S:FIRST LORD  Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  What will Count Rossillion do then?
 :
 :Will he travel higher or return again into France?
 :
 :FIRST LORD  I perceive by this demand you are not altogether
 :
S:of his counsel.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a
 :
 :great deal of his act.
S:
 :
S:FIRST LORD  Sir, his wife some two months since fled
 :
S:from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to
 :
 :Saint Jaques le Grand, which holy undertaking
 :
 :with most austere sanctimony she accomplished.
 :
 :And, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
S:became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan
 :
 :of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  How is this justified?
 :
 :FIRST LORD  The stronger part of it by her own letters,
 :which makes her story true even to the point of her
 :death. Her death itself, which could not be her
 :office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
S:
 :the rector of the place.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Hath the Count all this intelligence?
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Ay, and the particular confirmations, point
 :from point, to the full arming of the verity.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of
S:
 :this.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  How mightily sometimes we make us
 :
 :comforts of our losses.
 :
S:SECOND LORD  And how mightily some other times we
 :
S:drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his
 :
 :valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be
 :
S:encountered with a shame as ample.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,
 :
 :good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud
 :if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes
 :would despair if they were not cherished by our
 :virtues.
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
S:
S:
 :
 :How now? Where's your master?
 :
 :
 :
S:SERVANT  He met the Duke in the street, sir, of whom
 :
 :he hath taken a solemn leave. His Lordship will
 :
 :next morning for France. The Duke hath offered
 :
 :him letters of commendations to the King.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  They shall be no more than needful
 :there, if they were more than they can commend.
 :They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Here's his Lordship now.--How now, my lord? Is 't
 :
 :not after midnight?
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses,
 :
 :a month's length apiece. By an abstract of
 :
 :success: I have congeed with the Duke, done my
 :adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for
 :her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained
 :my convoy, and between these main parcels
 :of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last
 :was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  If the business be of any difficulty, and
 :
 :this morning your departure hence, it requires
 :
 :haste of your Lordship.
 :
 :BERTRAM  I mean the business is not ended as fearing
S:to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue
 :
S:between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,
 :
 :bring forth this counterfeit module; has deceived
 :
 :me like a double-meaning prophesier.
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Bring him forth. Has sat i' th' stocks all
 :night, poor gallant knave.	[Soldiers exit.]
 :
 :BERTRAM  No matter. His heels have deserved it in
 :usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry
S:
 :himself?
 :
 :
 :
S:SECOND LORD  I have told your Lordship already: the
 :
 :stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would
 :
 :be understood: he weeps like a wench that had
 :
S:shed her milk. He hath confessed himself to Morgan,
 :
 :whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time
 :
 :of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of
 :
 :his setting i' th' stocks. And what think you he hath
 :confessed?
 :
S:BERTRAM  Nothing of me, has he?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  His confession is taken, and it shall be
 :
 :read to his face. If your Lordship be in 't, as I
S:believe you are, you must have the patience to
 :
 :hear it.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Parolles, blindfolded, with his Interpreter,
 :the First Soldier.]
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  A plague upon him! Muffled! He can say
S:nothing of me.
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  Hush, hush. Hoodman
 :
 :comes.--Portotartarossa.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  He calls for the tortures.
S:What will you say without 'em?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I will confess what I know without constraint.
 :
 :If you pinch me like a pasty, I can say no
 :more.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Bosko Chimurcho.
 :
 :FIRST LORD  Boblibindo chicurmurco.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  You are a merciful general.--Our general
 :
 :bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a
 :
 :note.
 :
 :PAROLLES  And truly, as I hope to live.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [as if reading a note]  First, demand of
S:
 :him how many horse the Duke is strong.--What say
 :
S:you to that?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Five or six thousand, but very weak and
 :
 :unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and the
 :commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
 :and credit, and as I hope to live.
S:
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Shall I set down your answer so?
 :
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  Do. I'll take the Sacrament on 't, how and
 :
 :which way you will.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  All's one to him. What a past-saving
 :slave is this!
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  You're deceived, my
S:lord. This is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant
 :
 :militarist--that was his own phrase--that had the
 :
S:whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and
 :
 :the practice in the chape of his dagger.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  I will never trust a man again for
 :keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have
 :everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  Well, that's set down.
 :
S:
 :PAROLLES  "Five or six thousand horse," I said--I will
 :
S:say true--"or thereabouts" set down, for I'll speak
 :
 :truth.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside]  He's very near the truth in this.
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  But I con him no thanks for 't, in the
 :nature he delivers it.
 :
 :PAROLLES  "Poor rogues," I pray you say.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Well, that's set down.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth.
 :The rogues are marvelous poor.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [as if reading a note]  Demand of him of
 :what strength they are o' foot.--What say you to
S:
 :that?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  By my troth, sir, if I were to live but this
 :
S:present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio a
 :
 :hundred and fifty, Sebastian so many, Corambus
 :
 :so many, Jaques so many; Guiltian, Cosmo,
 :
 :Lodowick and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine
 :own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two
 :hundred fifty each; so that the muster-file, rotten
 :and sound, upon my life amounts not to fifteen
 :thousand poll, half of the which dare not shake the
 :snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves
S:
 :to pieces.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  What shall be done to him?
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside]  Nothing but let him have thanks.
 :[(Aside to First Soldier.)] Demand of him my condition
 :and what credit I have with the Duke.
 :
S:
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  Well, that's set down. [Preten
 :ding
 :
 :to read:] You shall demand of him whether
 :
 :one Captain Dumaine be i' th' camp, a Frenchman;
 :what his reputation is with the Duke, what his valor,
 :honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he
 :thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums
 :of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.--What say you to
 :this? What do you know of it?
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I beseech you let me answer to the particular
 :
 :of the inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Do you know this Captain Dumaine?
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  I know him. He was a botcher's prentice in
 :
S:Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the
 :
 :shrieve's fool with child, a dumb innocent that
 :
 :could not say him nay.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside to First Lord]  Nay, by your leave, hold
 :your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to
 :the next tile that falls.
 :
S:FIRST SOLDIER  Well, is this captain in the Duke of
 :
 :Florence's camp?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy.
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  Nay, look not so upon
 :me. We shall hear of your Lordship anon.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  What is his reputation with the Duke?
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  The Duke knows him for no other but a
 :
 :poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day
 :
S:to turn him out o' th' band. I think I have his letter
 :
 :in my pocket.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Marry, we'll search.
 :[They search Parolles' pockets.]
 :
 :PAROLLES  In good sadness, I do not know. Either it is
 :there, or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters
S:in my tent.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to
 :
 :
 :you?
 :
 :PAROLLES  I do not know if it be it or no.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  Our interpreter does it well.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside]  Excellently.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER [reads]  Dian, the Count's a fool and full
 :of gold--
 :
 :PAROLLES  That is not the Duke's letter, sir. That is an
S:
 :advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
 :
 :Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
 :
 :Rossillion, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
 :
 :ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  Nay, I'll read it first, by your favor.
 :
 :PAROLLES  My meaning in 't, I protest, was very honest
S:
 :in the behalf of the maid, for I knew the young
 :
 :count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is
 :
 :a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it
 :
 :finds.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  Damnable both-sides rogue!
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER [reads]
 :When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and
 :take it.
 :After he scores, he never pays the score.
 :Half won is match well made. Match, and well
 :make it.
S:
 :He ne'er pays after-debts. Take it before.
 :
 :And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
 :
S:Men are to mell with; boys are not to kiss.
 :
 :For count of this: the Count's a fool, I know it,
 :
 :Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
 :
 :Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
 :Parolles.
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  He shall be whipped through the
 :army with this rhyme in 's forehead.
 :
S:
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  This is your devoted friend, sir,
 :
 :the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  I could endure anything before but a
 :cat, and now he's a cat to me.
S:
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  I perceive, sir, by our
 :
 :general's looks we shall be fain to hang you.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid
 :to die, but that, my offenses being many, I would
 :repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live,
 :sir, in a dungeon, i' th' stocks, or anywhere, so I
S:may live.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  We'll see what may be done, so you confess
 :
 :freely. Therefore once more to this Captain
 :Dumaine: you have answered to his reputation
 :with the Duke, and to his valor. What is his
 :honesty?
 :
 :PAROLLES  He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister. For
S:
 :rapes and ravishments, he parallels Nessus. He
 :
S:professes not keeping of oaths. In breaking 'em he
 :
 :is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such
 :
 :volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
 :
 :Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be
 :swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm,
 :save to his bedclothes about him; but they know
S:his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
 :
 :little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything
 :
 :that an honest man should not have; what an
 :
 :honest man should have, he has nothing.
S:
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside]  I begin to love him for this.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  For this description of thine honesty?
S:A pox upon him! For me, he's more and more
 :
 :a cat.
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST SOLDIER  What say you to his expertness in war?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
 :
 :tragedians. To belie him I will not, and more
 :of his soldiership I know not, except in that country
 :he had the honor to be the officer at a place
 :there called Mile End, to instruct for the doubling
 :of files. I would do the man what honor I can, but
 :of this I am not certain.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD, [aside]  He hath out-villained villainy so
 :
 :far that the rarity redeems him.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM, [aside]  A pox on him! He's a cat still.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  His qualities being at this poor price,
 :I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to
S:
 :revolt.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple
 :
 :of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut th'
S:entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession
 :
 :for it perpetually.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  What's his brother, the other Captain
 :Dumaine?
 :
 :SECOND LORD, [aside]  Why does he ask him of me?
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  What's he?
S:
S:
 :
 :PAROLLES  E'en a crow o' th' same nest: not altogether
 :
 :so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
 :
S:deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet
 :
 :his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a
 :
 :retreat he outruns any lackey. Marry, in coming on
 :
 :he has the cramp.
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  If your life be saved, will you undertake
 :to betray the Florentine?
 :
 :PAROLLES  Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count
S:
 :Rossillion.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  I'll whisper with the General and know
 :
 :his pleasure.
 :
 :PAROLLES, [aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of
 :all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
 :beguile the supposition of that lascivious young
S:
 :boy the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
 :
 :would have suspected an ambush where I was
 :
 :taken?
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  There is no remedy, sir, but you must
 :
 :die. The General says you that have so traitorously
 :
 :discovered the secrets of your army and made
 :such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held
S:can serve the world for no honest use. Therefore
 :
 :you must die.--Come, headsman, off with his
 :
 :head.
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my
 :death!
 :
S:FIRST SOLDIER  That shall you, and take your leave of
 :
 :all your friends. [He removes the blindfold.] So,
 :
 :look about you. Know you any here?
 :
S:
 :
S:BERTRAM  Good morrow, noble captain.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND LORD  God bless you, Captain Parolles.
 :
 :
 :FIRST LORD  God save you, noble captain.
 :
 :SECOND LORD  Captain, what greeting will you to my
 :Lord Lafew? I am for France.
 :
S:
 :FIRST LORD  Good captain, will you give me a copy of
 :
 :the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count
 :
 :Rossillion? An I were not a very coward, I'd compel
 :
S:it of you. But fare you well.
 :
 :[Bertram and Lords exit.]
 :
 :
 :
S:FIRST SOLDIER  You are undone, captain--all but your
 :
 :scarf; that has a knot on 't yet.
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SOLDIER  If you could find out a country where
 :
 :but women were that had received so much
 :shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare
 :you well, sir. I am for France too. We shall speak of
 :you there.	[He exits.]
 :
 :PAROLLES
S:
 :Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
 :
 :'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more,
 :
 :But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
 :
 :As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
 :Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
 :Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
 :That every braggart shall be found an ass.
 :Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and Parolles live
S:
 :Safest in shame. Being fooled, by fool'ry thrive.
 :
 :There's place and means for every man alive.
 :
 :I'll after them.	[He exits.]

S:
 :Scene 5
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Fool, Countess, and Lafew.]
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  No, no, no, your son was misled with a
 :snipped-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron
S:
 :would have made all the unbaked and doughy
 :
 :youth of a nation in his color. Your daughter-in-law
 :
 :had been alive at this hour, and your son here
 :
 :at home, more advanced by the King than by that
 :red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
 :
 :COUNTESS  I would I had not known him. It was the
 :death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever
S:
 :nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken
 :
 :of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a
 :
S:mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted
 :
 :love.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may
 :pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another
 :herb.
 :
 :FOOL  Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
 :salad, or rather the herb of grace.
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  They are not herbs, you knave. They are
 :
 :nose-herbs.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir. I have not
 :
 :much skill in grass.
 :
 :
S:LAFEW  Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a
 :
 :fool?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a
 :man's.
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  Your distinction?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  I would cozen the man of his wife and do his
 :service.
 :
 :LAFEW  So you were a knave at his service indeed.
 :
 :FOOL  And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do
S:
 :her service.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave
 :
 :and fool.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  At your service.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  No, no, no.
 :
 :FOOL  Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
 :great a prince as you are.
 :
 :LAFEW  Who's that, a Frenchman?
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Faith, sir, he has an English name, but his
 :
 :phys'nomy is more hotter in France than there.
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  What prince is that?
 :
 :FOOL  The black prince, sir, alias the prince of darkness,
 :alias the devil.

 :LAFEW, [giving him money]  Hold thee, there's my
 :
 :purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy
 :
 :master thou talk'st of. Serve him still.
 :
 :FOOL  I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
 :great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a
 :good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let
 :his Nobility remain in 's court. I am for the house
S:
 :with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little
 :
 :for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves
 :
 :may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and
 :
 :they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the
 :broad gate and the great fire.
 :
S:LAFEW  Go thy ways. I begin to be aweary of thee. And
 :
 :I tell thee so before because I would not fall out
 :
S:with thee. Go thy ways. Let my horses be well
 :
 :looked to, without any tricks.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
S:jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law
 :
 :of nature.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
S:
 :
 :COUNTESS  So he is. My lord that's gone made himself
 :
S:much sport out of him. By his authority he
 :
 :remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his
 :
 :sauciness, and indeed he has no pace, but runs
 :
 :where he will.
 :
 :LAFEW  I like him well. 'Tis not amiss. And I was about
 :to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death
 :and that my lord your son was upon his return
 :home, I moved the King my master to speak in the
S:
 :behalf of my daughter, which in the minority of
 :
 :them both his Majesty out of a self-gracious
 :
 :remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath
 :
 :promised me to do it, and to stop up the displeasure
 :he hath conceived against your son there is
 :no fitter matter. How does your Ladyship like it?
 :
 :COUNTESS  With very much content, my lord, and I
S:
 :wish it happily effected.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of
 :
 :as able body as when he numbered thirty. He will
 :
 :be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in
 :such intelligence hath seldom failed.
 :
 :COUNTESS  It rejoices me that, I hope, I shall see him
 :ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here
 :tonight. I shall beseech your Lordship to remain
S:
 :with me till they meet together.
 :
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
 :
 :might safely be admitted.
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  You need but plead your honorable
 :privilege.
 :
 :LAFEW  Lady, of that I have made a bold charter. But I
 :thank my God it holds yet.
S:
 :
 :
S:[Enter Fool.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a
S:patch of velvet on 's face. Whether there be a scar
 :
 :under 't or no, the velvet knows, but 'tis a goodly
 :
 :patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile
 :
 :and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
S:
 :
 :LAFEW  A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry
 :
 :of honor. So belike is that.
 :
 :
S:FOOL  But it is your carbonadoed face.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk
 :
S:with the young noble soldier.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  'Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
 :
 :hats, and most courteous feathers which bow the
 :head and nod at every man.

 :=======
 :[Enter Fool and Parolles.]
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES, [holding out a paper]  Good Monsieur
 :Lavatch, give my lord Lafew this letter. I have ere
S:
 :now, sir, been better known to you, when I have
 :
 :held familiarity with fresher clothes. But I am
 :
 :now, sir, muddied in Fortune's mood, and smell
 :
S:somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it
 :
 :smell so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth
 :eat no fish of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee,
 :allow the wind.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I
 :spake but by a metaphor.
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink I will stop my
 :
 :nose, or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
 :
 :thee further.
 :
 :PAROLLES  Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
 :
S:FOOL  Foh! Prithee, stand away. A paper from Fortune's
 :
 :close-stool, to give to a nobleman!
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Lafew.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Look, here he comes himself.--Here is a purr of
 :Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat--but not a
 :musk-cat--that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond
S:of her displeasure and, as he says, is muddied
 :
 :withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may,
 :
 :for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish,
 :
 :rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my
 :smiles of comfort, and leave him to your Lordship.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :PAROLLES  My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath
 :cruelly scratched.
S:
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too
 :
 :late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you
 :
 :played the knave with Fortune that she should
 :scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and
 :would not have knaves thrive long under her?
 :There's a cardecu for you. Let the justices make
 :you and Fortune friends. I am for other business.
S:
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I beseech your Honor to hear me one single
 :
S:word.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall
 :
 :ha 't. Save your word.
 :
S:PAROLLES  My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  You beg more than a word, then. Cock's my
 :
 :passion; give me your hand. How does your drum?
 :
 :PAROLLES  O my good lord, you were the first that
S:found me.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost
 :
S:thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some

S:grace, for you did bring me out.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me
 :
 :at once both the office of God and the devil? One
 :brings thee in grace, and the other brings thee out.
 :[Trumpets sound.] The King's coming. I know by
 :his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I
 :had talk of you last night. Though you are a fool

 :=======
 :[Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, the two French
S:Lords, with Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
 :We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
 :
 :Was made much poorer by it. But your son,
 :As mad in folly, lacked the sense to know
 :Her estimation home.
 :
 :COUNTESS  'Tis past, my liege,
 :And I beseech your Majesty to make it
S:
 :Natural rebellion done i' th' blade of youth,
 :
 :When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
 :
 :O'erbears it and burns on.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING  My honored lady,
 :
S:I have forgiven and forgotten all,
 :
 :Though my revenges were high bent upon him
 :
 :And watched the time to shoot.
 :
 :
S:LAFEW  This I must say--
 :
 :But first I beg my pardon: the young lord
 :
 :Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady
 :
 :Offense of mighty note, but to himself
 :The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
 :Whose beauty did astonish the survey
S:Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
 :
S:Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve
 :
 :Humbly called mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  Praising what is lost
 :Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither.
S:We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
 :
 :All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon.
 :
 :The nature of his great offense is dead,
 :
S:And deeper than oblivion we do bury
 :
 :Th' incensing relics of it. Let him approach
 :
 :A stranger, no offender, and inform him
 :
 :So 'tis our will he should.
 :
 :GENTLEMAN  I shall, my liege.	[He exits.]
 :
 :KING
 :What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
S:
S:
 :
 :LAFEW
 :
 :All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
 :That sets him high in fame.
 :
 :[Enter Count Bertram.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  He looks well on 't.
 :
 :
 :KING  I am not a day of season,
 :For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
 :In me at once. But to the brightest beams
S:Distracted clouds give way. So stand thou forth.
 :
 :The time is fair again.
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  My high-repented blames,
 :Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
 :
 :KING  All is whole.
 :Not one word more of the consumed time.
 :Let's take the instant by the forward top,
S:
 :For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
 :
 :Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of time
 :
S:Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
 :
 :The daughter of this lord?
 :
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Admiringly, my liege. At first
 :I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
 :Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;
 :Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
 :Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
 :Which warped the line of every other favor,
S:
 :Scorned a fair color or expressed it stol'n,
 :
 :Extended or contracted all proportions
 :
 :To a most hideous object. Thence it came
 :
 :That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
 :Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
 :The dust that did offend it.
 :
 :KING  Well excused.
S:
 :That thou didst love her strikes some scores away
 :
 :From the great compt. But love that comes too late,
 :
 :Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
 :
 :To the great sender turns a sour offense,
 :Crying "That's good that's gone!" Our rash faults
S:Make trivial price of serious things we have,
 :
 :Not knowing them until we know their grave.
 :
 :Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
 :
 :Destroy our friends and after weep their dust.
 :Our own love, waking, cries to see what's done,
S:While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
 :
 :Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
 :
 :Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
 :
 :The main consents are had, and here we'll stay
 :To see our widower's second marriage day.
 :
S:COUNTESS
 :
 :Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless,
 :
 :Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
 :
 :
 :LAFEW
 :Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
 :Must be digested, give a favor from you
 :To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
S:That she may quickly come.
 :
 :[Bertram gives him a ring.]
 :
S:By my old beard
 :
 :And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen that's dead
 :
 :Was a sweet creature. Such a ring as this,
 :
 :The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
 :I saw upon her finger.
 :
 :BERTRAM  Hers it was not.
 :
S:KING
 :
 :Now, pray you, let me see it, for mine eye,
 :
 :While I was speaking, oft was fastened to 't.
 :
 :[Lafew passes the ring to the King.]
 :This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,
 :I bade her if her fortunes ever stood
S:Necessitied to help, that by this token
 :
 :I would relieve her. [To Bertram.] Had you that craft to
 :
 :reave her
 :
 :Of what should stead her most?
 :
 :BERTRAM  My gracious
 :sovereign,
 :Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
 :The ring was never hers.
S:
 :
 :
 :COUNTESS  Son, on my life,
 :
 :I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned it
 :
 :At her life's rate.
 :
 :LAFEW  I am sure I saw her wear it.
 :
S:BERTRAM
 :
 :You are deceived, my lord. She never saw it.
 :
S:In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
 :
 :Wrapped in a paper which contained the name
 :
S:Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
 :
 :I stood ungaged, but when I had subscribed
 :
 :To mine own fortune and informed her fully
 :
 :I could not answer in that course of honor
 :As she had made the overture, she ceased
 :In heavy satisfaction and would never
 :Receive the ring again.
 :
S:KING  Plutus himself,
 :
S:That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
 :
 :Hath not in nature's mystery more science
 :
S:Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
 :
 :Whoever gave it you. Then if you know
 :
 :That you are well acquainted with yourself,
 :
 :Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement
 :You got it from her. She called the saints to surety
 :That she would never put it from her finger
 :Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
 :Where you have never come, or sent it us
 :Upon her great disaster.
S:
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  She never saw it.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
S:Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honor,
 :
 :And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
 :
 :Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
 :
 :That thou art so inhuman--'twill not prove so,
S:And yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly,
 :
 :And she is dead, which nothing but to close
 :
 :Her eyes myself could win me to believe
 :
 :More than to see this ring.--Take him away.
 :My forepast proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
 :Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
 :Having vainly feared too little. Away with him.
 :We'll sift this matter further.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  If you shall prove
 :
 :This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
 :
 :Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
 :Where yet she never was.	[He exits, under guard.]
 :
 :KING
 :I am wrapped in dismal thinkings.
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Gentleman.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :GENTLEMAN  Gracious sovereign,
 :Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.
 :[He gives the King a paper.]
 :Here's a petition from a Florentine
S:Who hath for four or five removes come short
 :
 :To tender it herself. I undertook it,
 :
 :Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech
 :
 :Of the poor suppliant, who, by this, I know
 :Is here attending. Her business looks in her
 :With an importing visage, and she told me,
S:In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
 :
 :Your Highness with herself.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING [reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me
 :when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
 :me. Now is the Count Rossillion a widower, his
S:vows are forfeited to me and my honor's paid to him.
 :
 :He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
 :
 :him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king.
 :
 :In you it best lies. Otherwise a seducer flourishes,
 :and a poor maid is undone.
 :Diana Capilet.
 :
 :LAFEW  I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
 :this. I'll none of him.
S:
 :
 :
 :KING
 :
 :The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,
 :
 :To bring forth this discov'ry.--Seek these suitors.
 :Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
 :[Gentleman and Attendants exit.]
 :I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
 :Was foully snatched.
S:

S:I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you
 :
 :And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
 :
 :Yet you desire to marry.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Widow and Diana.]
 :
S:What woman's that?
 :
 :
 :
 :DIANA
 :
 :I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
 :Derived from the ancient Capilet.
 :My suit, as I do understand, you know
S:And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
 :
 :
 :
 :WIDOW
 :
 :I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor
 :Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
 :And both shall cease without your remedy.
 :
 :KING
 :Come hither, count. Do you know these women?
S:
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :My lord, I neither can nor will deny
 :
 :But that I know them. Do they charge me further?
 :
 :DIANA
 :Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
 :She's none of mine, my lord.
 :
 :
 :DIANA  If you shall marry,
 :You give away this hand, and that is mine;
 :You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
 :You give away myself, which is known mine,
S:For I by vow am so embodied yours
 :
 :That she which marries you must marry me,
 :
 :Either both or none.
 :
 :
 :LAFEW, [to Bertram]  Your reputation comes too short
 :for my daughter. You are no husband for her.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM, [to the King]
 :
 :My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature
 :
 :Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your
S:Highness
 :
 :Lay a more noble thought upon mine honor
 :
 :Than for to think that I would sink it here.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
 :Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honor
 :Than in my thought it lies.
 :
S:
S:DIANA  Good my lord,
 :
 :Ask him upon his oath if he does think
 :
 :He had not my virginity.
 :
 :
 :KING
 :What sayst thou to her?
 :
 :BERTRAM  She's impudent, my lord,
 :And was a common gamester to the camp.
S:
 :
 :
 :DIANA
 :
S:He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so,
 :
 :He might have bought me at a common price.
 :
 :Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
 :
 :Whose high respect and rich validity
 :Did lack a parallel. Yet for all that
 :He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
 :If I be one.
 :
 :COUNTESS  He blushes, and 'tis hit.
S:
 :Of six preceding ancestors that gem,
 :
 :Conferred by testament to th' sequent issue,
 :
 :Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife.
 :
 :That ring's a thousand proofs.
 :
 :KING, [to Diana]  Methought you said
 :You saw one here in court could witness it.
 :
S:
 :DIANA
 :
 :I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
 :
 :So bad an instrument. His name's Parolles.
 :
 :

S:I saw the man today, if man he be.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Find him, and bring him hither.	[Attendant exits.]
 :
 :BERTRAM  What of him?
 :He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
 :With all the spots o' th' world taxed and debauched,
 :Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
S:
 :Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
 :
 :That will speak anything?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  She hath that ring of yours.
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :I think she has. Certain it is I liked her
 :And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
S:
S:She knew her distance and did angle for me,
 :
 :Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
 :
 :As all impediments in fancy's course
 :
 :Are motives of more fancy; and in fine
 :Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
 :Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring,
 :And I had that which any inferior might
 :At market price have bought.
 :
S:
 :DIANA  I must be patient.
 :
 :You that have turned off a first so noble wife
 :
 :May justly diet me. I pray you yet--
 :
 :Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband--
 :Send for your ring. I will return it home,
 :And give me mine again.
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM  I have it not.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING, [to Diana]  What ring was yours, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :
 :DIANA

 :Sir, much like the same upon your finger.

S:
S:And this was it I gave him, being abed.
 :
 :
 :

 :The story, then, goes false you threw it him
S:Out of a casement?

S:By him and by this woman here what know you?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  So please your Majesty, my master hath
 :
 :been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had
S:in him which gentlemen have.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING  Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this
 :
 :woman?
 :
 :
 :
S:PAROLLES  Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?
 :
 :
 :
 :KING  How, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a
 :woman.
 :
 :KING  How is that?
 :
S:
 :PAROLLES  He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING  As thou art a knave and no knave. What an
 :
 :equivocal companion is this!
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's
 :command.
 :
 :LAFEW  He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty
 :orator.
 :
S:
 :DIANA  Do you know he promised me marriage?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAROLLES  Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
 :
 :
 :KING  But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
 :
S:PAROLLES  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go
 :
S:between them, as I said; but more than that he
 :
 :loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and
 :
 :talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I
 :
 :know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them
 :at that time, that I knew of their going to bed and
 :of other motions, as promising her marriage, and
 :things which would derive me ill will to speak of.
 :Therefore I will not speak what I know.
S:
 :
 :KING  Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst
 :
 :say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy
 :
 :evidence. Therefore stand aside.
 :[To Diana.]
 :This ring you say was yours?
S:
 :
 :DIANA  Ay, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :
S:KING
 :
 :Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
 :
 :
 :
 :DIANA
 :It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
S:Who lent it you?
 :
 :
 :
 :DIANA  It was not lent me neither.
 :
 :
S:KING
 :
S:Where did you find it then?
 :
S:
 :
 :DIANA  I found it not.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
 :If it were yours by none of all these ways,
 :
 :How could you give it him?
S:
 :
 :DIANA  I never gave it him.
 :
 :
 :
 :LAFEW  This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes
 :off and on at pleasure.
 :
 :KING
 :This ring was mine. I gave it his first wife.
 :
S:
 :DIANA
 :
 :It might be yours or hers for aught I know.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING, [to Attendants]
S:Take her away. I do not like her now.
 :
 :To prison with her, and away with him.--
 :
 :Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
 :
 :Thou diest within this hour.
 :
 :DIANA  I'll never tell you.
 :
 :KING
 :Take her away.
S:
 :
 :
 :DIANA  I'll put in bail, my liege.
 :
S:
 :
 :KING
 :
 :I think thee now some common customer.
 :
 :
 :DIANA, [to Bertram]
 :By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
 :
 :KING
 :Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
S:
S:
 :
 :DIANA
 :
 :Because he's guilty and he is not guilty.
 :
S:He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to 't.
 :
 :I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
 :
 :Great king, I am no strumpet. By my life,
 :
 :I am either maid or else this old man's wife.
 :
 :KING
 :She does abuse our ears. To prison with her.
 :
 :DIANA
S:
 :Good mother, fetch my bail. [Widow exits.] Stay,
 :
 :royal sir.
 :
 :The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for,
 :
S:And he shall surety me. But for this lord
 :
 :Who hath abused me as he knows himself,
 :
 :Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.
 :
 :He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,
 :And at that time he got his wife with child.
S:Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.
 :
 :So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick.
 :
 :And now behold the meaning.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Helen and Widow.]
 :
 :
 :KING  Is there no exorcist
 :Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
S:
 :Is 't real that I see?
 :
 :
 :
S:HELEN  No, my good lord,
 :
 :'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
 :
 :The name and not the thing.
 :
 :
 :BERTRAM  Both, both. O, pardon!
 :
 :HELEN
 :O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
 :I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
S:
S:And, look you, here's your letter. [She takes out a
 :
 :paper.] This it says:
 :
 :When from my finger you can get this ring
 :
 :And are by me with child, etc. This is done.
 :Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
S:
 :
 :BERTRAM
 :
S:If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
 :
 :I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN
S:If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
 :
 :Deadly divorce step between me and you.--
 :
 :O my dear mother, do I see you living?
 :
 :
 :LAFEW
 :Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon.--
S:[To Parolles.] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.
 :
 :So, I thank thee. Wait on me home.
 :
 :I'll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone.
 :
 :They are scurvy ones.
 :
 :KING
S:Let us from point to point this story know,
 :
 :To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
 :
S:[To Diana.] If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
 :
 :Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower.
 :
 :For I can guess that by thy honest aid
 :
 :Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
S:Of that and all the progress more and less,
 :
 :Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
 :
 :All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,
 :
 :The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
 :[Flourish.]
 :
S:EPILOGUE
 :
 :========
 :
 :
 :
 :The King's a beggar, now the play is done.
 :All is well ended if this suit be won,
S:That you express content, which we will pay,
 :
 :With strift to please you, day exceeding day.
 :
 :Ours be your patience, then, and yours our parts.
 :
 :Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
 :[All exit.]
