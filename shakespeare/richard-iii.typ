S:
 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, alone.]
S:
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Now is the winter of our discontent
 :
 :Made glorious summer by this son of York,
 :
 :And all the clouds that loured upon our house
 :
 :In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
 :Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
 :Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
 :Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
 :Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
 :Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
S:
 :And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
 :
 :To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
 :
 :He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
 :
 :To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
 :But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
 :Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;
 :I, that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty
 :To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
S:
 :I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
 :
 :Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
 :
 :Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
 :
 :Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
 :And that so lamely and unfashionable
 :That dogs bark at me as I halt by them--
 :Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
 :Have no delight to pass away the time,
S:
 :Unless to see my shadow in the sun
 :
 :And descant on mine own deformity.
 :
S:And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
 :
 :To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
 :
 :I am determined to prove a villain
 :
 :And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
 :Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
 :By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
 :To set my brother Clarence and the King
 :In deadly hate, the one against the other;
 :And if King Edward be as true and just
S:
 :As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
 :
 :This day should Clarence closely be mewed up
 :
 :About a prophecy which says that "G"
 :
 :Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
 :Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence
 :comes.
 :
 :[Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury.]
S:
 :
 :
 :Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
 :
 :That waits upon your Grace?
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE  His Majesty,
 :Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
 :This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Upon what cause?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE  Because my name is
 :George.
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
 :
 :He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
 :
 :O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
 :That you should be new christened in the Tower.
 :But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest
S:
 :As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,
 :
S:He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
 :
 :And from the crossrow plucks the letter G,
 :
 :And says a wizard told him that by "G"
 :
S:His issue disinherited should be.
 :
S:And for my name of George begins with G,
 :
 :It follows in his thought that I am he.
 :
 :These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
 :
 :Hath moved his Highness to commit me now.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
 :
 :'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower.
 :
 :My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
 :
 :That tempers him to this extremity.
 :Was it not she and that good man of worship,
 :Anthony Woodeville, her brother there,
 :That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
 :From whence this present day he is delivered?
 :We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
 :By heaven, I think there is no man secure
 :
 :But the Queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
 :That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
 :Heard you not what an humble suppliant
 :Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Humbly complaining to her Deity
 :
 :Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
 :
S:I'll tell you what: I think it is our way,
 :
S:If we will keep in favor with the King,
 :
 :To be her men and wear her livery.
 :
 :The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
 :
 :Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,
 :Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
 :I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.
 :His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
S:
 :That no man shall have private conference,
 :
 :Of what degree soever, with your brother.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Even so. An please your Worship, Brakenbury,
 :You may partake of anything we say.
 :We speak no treason, man. We say the King
 :Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
S:
 :Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
 :
 :We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
 :
 :A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,
 :
 :And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
S:How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
 :
 :With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee,
 :fellow,
 :He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
S:
 :Were best to do it secretly, alone.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRAKENBURY
 :
 :I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal
 :
 :Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
S:We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.--
 :Brother, farewell. I will unto the King,
 :And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,
 :Were it to call King Edward's widow "sister,"
S:I will perform it to enfranchise you.
 :
 :Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
 :
 :Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.
S:
S:I will deliver you or else lie for you.
 :
 :Meantime, have patience.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE  I must, perforce. Farewell.
 :[Exit Clarence, Brakenbury, and guard.]
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
 :Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
S:
 :That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
 :
 :If heaven will take the present at our hands.
 :
 :But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lord Hastings.]
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
S:
 :Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
S:Well are you welcome to the open air.
 :
 :How hath your Lordship brooked imprisonment?
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
 :But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
 :That were the cause of my imprisonment.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,
 :
S:For they that were your enemies are his
 :
 :And have prevailed as much on him as you.
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :More pity that the eagles should be mewed,
 :Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
 :
 :RICHARD  What news abroad?
 :
S:
S:HASTINGS
 :
 :No news so bad abroad as this at home:
 :
 :The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
 :
 :And his physicians fear him mightily.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
 :O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
 :And overmuch consumed his royal person.
S:
 :'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
 :
 :Where is he, in his bed?
 :
 :
 :
S:HASTINGS  He is.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Go you before, and I will follow you.
S:[Exit Hastings.]
 :
 :He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
 :
 :Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.
 :
 :I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
 :With lies well steeled with weighty arguments,
 :And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
S:Clarence hath not another day to live;
 :
 :Which done, God take King Edward to His mercy,
 :
S:And leave the world for me to bustle in.
 :
 :For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
 :
 :What though I killed her husband and her father?
 :
 :The readiest way to make the wench amends
 :Is to become her husband and her father;
 :The which will I, not all so much for love
 :As for another secret close intent
S:By marrying her which I must reach unto.
 :
 :But yet I run before my horse to market.
 :
S:Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.
 :
 :When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
 :
 :[He exits.]

 :[Enter the corse of Henry the Sixth on a bier, with

 :
 :
 :ANNE
S:
 :Set down, set down your honorable load,
 :
 :If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,
 :
 :Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
 :
 :Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
 :[They set down the bier.]
 :Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,
 :Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,
 :Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,
S:
 :Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
 :
 :To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
 :
 :Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
 :
S:Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these
 :
 :wounds.
 :
 :Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
 :
 :I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
 :O, cursed be the hand that made these holes;
 :Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it;
 :Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence.
 :More direful hap betide that hated wretch
 :That makes us wretched by the death of thee
S:
 :Than I can wish to wolves, to spiders, toads,
 :
S:Or any creeping venomed thing that lives.
 :
 :If ever he have child, abortive be it,
 :
 :Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
 :
S:Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
 :
 :May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
 :
 :And that be heir to his unhappiness.
 :
S:If ever he have wife, let her be made
 :
 :More miserable by the death of him
 :
 :Than I am made by my young lord and thee.--
 :
 :Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
 :Taken from Paul's to be interred there.
 :[They take up the bier.]
 :And still, as you are weary of this weight,
 :Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
 :
 :ANNE
 :What black magician conjures up this fiend
S:
 :To stop devoted charitable deeds?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Villains, set down the corse or, by Saint Paul,
 :I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
 :
 :GENTLEMAN
S:My lord, stand back and let the coffin pass.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Unmannered dog, stand thou when I command!--
 :Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
 :Or by Saint Paul I'll strike thee to my foot
 :And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
 :[They set down the bier.]
S:
 :
 :ANNE, [to the Gentlemen and Halberds]
 :
 :What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
 :
 :Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
S:And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.--
 :
 :Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell.
 :
 :Thou hadst but power over his mortal body;
 :
 :His soul thou canst not have. Therefore begone.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us
 :not,
 :For thou hast made the happy Earth thy hell,
 :Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
 :If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
 :Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
S:
 :[She points to the corpse.]
 :
 :O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry's wounds
 :
 :Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!--
 :
S:Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
 :
 :For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
 :
S:From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.
 :
 :Thy deeds, inhuman and unnatural,
 :
 :Provokes this deluge most unnatural.--
 :
S:O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
 :
S:O Earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his
 :
 :death!
 :
 :Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer
 :
 :dead,
 :Or Earth gape open wide and eat him quick,
 :As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
S:Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Lady, you know no rules of charity,
 :Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
 :
 :ANNE
 :Villain, thou know'st nor law of God nor man.
 :No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
S:
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :O, wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
 :
S:Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
 :
 :Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
 :
 :By circumstance but to acquit myself.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
 :
 :Of these known evils but to give me leave
 :By circumstance to curse thy cursed self.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
 :Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
S:
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
 :
 :No excuse current but to hang thyself.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :By such despair I should accuse myself.
 :
S:ANNE
 :
 :And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
 :
 :For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
 :
 :That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
 :
 :RICHARD  Say that I slew them not.
 :
 :ANNE  Then say they were not slain.
 :But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  I did not kill your husband.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE  Why then, he is alive.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :In thy foul throat thou liest. Queen Margaret saw
 :
 :Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood,
 :The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
 :But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue,
 :
 :That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
S:Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
 :
 :That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
 :
 :Didst thou not kill this king?
 :
 :
S:RICHARD  I grant you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me too
 :Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed.
 :O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:The better for the King of heaven that hath him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,
 :
 :For he was fitter for that place than Earth.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :And thou unfit for any place but hell.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
 :
S:ANNE  Some dungeon.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Your bedchamber.
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
 :
 :RICHARD
 :So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
S:
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
S:I hope so.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD  I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
 :
 :To leave this keen encounter of our wits
 :
S:And fall something into a slower method:
 :
 :Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
 :
 :Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
 :
 :As blameful as the executioner?
 :
 :ANNE
 :Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :Your beauty was the cause of that effect--
 :
S:Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep
 :
 :To undertake the death of all the world,
 :
 :So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
 :These nails should rend that beauty from my
 :cheeks.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :These eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack.
 :
 :You should not blemish it, if I stood by.
 :
 :As all the world is cheered by the sun,
 :So I by that. It is my day, my life.
 :
 :ANNE
 :Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :It is a quarrel most unnatural
 :To be revenged on him that loveth thee.
 :
 :ANNE
S:
 :It is a quarrel just and reasonable
 :
S:To be revenged on him that killed my husband.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
 :Did it to help thee to a better husband.
 :
 :ANNE
 :His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :He lives that loves thee better than he could.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :Name him.
 :
 :RICHARD  Plantagenet.
 :
S:
 :ANNE  Why, that was he.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANNE
 :
 :Where is he?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Here. [(She spits at him.)] Why dost
S:thou spit at me?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Never came poison from so sweet a place.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
 :Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Would they were basilisks' to strike thee dead.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :I would they were, that I might die at once,
 :
 :For now they kill me with a living death.
 :
 :Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt
 :tears,
 :Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops.
S:These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear--
 :
 :No, when my father York and Edward wept
 :
S:To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
 :
 :When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
 :
 :Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
 :
S:Told the sad story of my father's death
 :
 :And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
 :
 :That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
 :
 :Like trees bedashed with rain--in that sad time,
 :My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
S:And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
 :
 :Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with
 :
 :weeping.
 :
 :I never sued to friend nor enemy;
 :My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word.
 :But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
 :My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to
 :speak.	[She looks scornfully at him.]
 :Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made
S:
 :For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
 :
 :If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
 :
 :Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,
 :
 :Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
 :And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
 :I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
 :And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
 :[He kneels and lays his breast open;
S:
 :she offers at it with his sword.]
 :
 :Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry--
 :
 :But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
 :
S:Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabbed young
 :
 :Edward--
 :
 :But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
 :
 :[She falls the sword.]
 :Take up the sword again, or take up me.
 :
 :ANNE
 :Arise, dissembler. Though I wish thy death,
 :I will not be thy executioner.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD, [rising]
 :
 :Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
 :
 :
 :ANNE
S:I have already.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  That was in thy rage.
 :
 :Speak it again and, even with the word,
 :This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
S:Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.
 :
S:To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE  I would I knew thy heart.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  'Tis figured in my tongue.
 :
 :ANNE  I fear me both are false.
 :
 :RICHARD  Then never was man true.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANNE  Well, well, put up your sword.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Say then my peace is made.
 :
 :ANNE  That shalt thou know hereafter.
 :
 :RICHARD  But shall I live in hope?
S:
 :
 :
 :ANNE  All men I hope live so.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
 :
 :ANNE  To take is not to give.
 :[He places the ring on her hand.]
 :
S:
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger;
 :
 :Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart.
 :
 :Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
 :And if thy poor devoted servant may
 :But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,
 :Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.
 :
 :ANNE  What is it?
S:
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :That it may please you leave these sad designs
 :
 :To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
S:And presently repair to Crosby House,
 :
 :Where, after I have solemnly interred
 :
 :At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king
 :
 :And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
S:I will with all expedient duty see you.
 :
S:For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
 :
 :Grant me this boon.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :With all my heart, and much it joys me too
 :To see you are become so penitent.--
 :Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :Bid me farewell.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANNE  'Tis more than you deserve;
 :
 :But since you teach me how to flatter you,
 :
 :Imagine I have said "farewell" already.
 :
 :[Two exit with Anne. The bier is taken up.]
 :
 :GENTLEMAN  Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
 :
 :RICHARD
S:No, to Whitefriars. There attend my coming.
 :
 :[Halberds and gentlemen exit with corse.]
 :
 :Was ever woman in this humor wooed?
 :
 :Was ever woman in this humor won?
 :I'll have her, but I will not keep her long.
 :What, I that killed her husband and his father,
 :To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
 :With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
 :The bleeding witness of my hatred by,
S:
 :Having God, her conscience, and these bars against
 :
 :me,
 :
 :And I no friends to back my suit at all
 :
 :But the plain devil and dissembling looks?
 :And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
 :Ha!
 :Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
 :Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since
S:
 :Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?
 :
 :A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
 :
 :Framed in the prodigality of nature,
 :
S:Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
 :
 :The spacious world cannot again afford.
 :
 :And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
 :
 :That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince
S:And made her widow to a woeful bed?
 :
 :On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
 :
 :On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
 :
 :My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
S:I do mistake my person all this while!
 :
 :Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
 :
S:Myself to be a marv'lous proper man.
 :
 :I'll be at charges for a looking glass
 :
S:And entertain a score or two of tailors
 :
 :To study fashions to adorn my body.
 :
 :Since I am crept in favor with myself,
 :
 :I will maintain it with some little cost.
 :But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave
 :And then return lamenting to my love.
 :Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
 :That I may see my shadow as I pass.
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :
S:[Enter Queen Elizabeth, the Lord Marquess of Dorset,
 :
 :Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :RIVERS
 :Have patience, madam. There's no doubt his
S:Majesty
 :
 :Will soon recover his accustomed health.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREY
 :In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.
 :Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort
S:And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :If he were dead, what would betide on me?
 :
 :GREY
 :No other harm but loss of such a lord.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:
 :The loss of such a lord includes all harms.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREY
 :
 :The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son
 :To be your comforter when he is gone.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:Ah, he is young, and his minority
 :
 :Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
 :
 :A man that loves not me nor none of you.
 :
 :
 :RIVERS
 :Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:It is determined, not concluded yet;
 :
 :But so it must be if the King miscarry.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Buckingham and Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.]
 :
 :
S:GREY
 :
 :Here comes the lord of Buckingham, and Derby.
 :
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :
 :Good time of day unto your royal Grace.
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :The Countess Richmond, good my lord of Derby,
S:
 :To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
 :
 :Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
 :
 :And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
 :
S:I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :
 :I do beseech you either not believe
 :The envious slanders of her false accusers,
 :Or if she be accused on true report,
 :Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
S:From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Saw you the King today, my lord of Derby?
 :
 :STANLEY
 :But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
 :Are come from visiting his Majesty.
 :
S:
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Madam, good hope. His Grace speaks cheerfully.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :God grant him health. Did you confer with him?
S:
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Ay, madam. He desires to make atonement
 :
 :Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
 :
 :And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,
 :And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Would all were well--but that will never be.
 :I fear our happiness is at the height.
S:
S:
 :
 :[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Hastings.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!
 :Who is it that complains unto the King
 :That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
S:By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
 :
 :That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
 :
 :Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
 :
 :Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
 :Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
 :I must be held a rancorous enemy.
 :Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
 :But thus his simple truth must be abused
 :With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
S:
 :
 :
 :GREY
 :
 :To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
S:To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
 :
S:When have I injured thee? When done thee
 :
 :wrong?--
 :
 :Or thee?--Or thee? Or any of your faction?
 :
 :A plague upon you all! His royal Grace,
 :Whom God preserve better than you would wish,
 :Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
 :But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
 :
 :The King, on his own royal disposition,
S:And not provoked by any suitor else,
 :
 :Aiming belike at your interior hatred
 :
 :That in your outward action shows itself
 :
 :Against my children, brothers, and myself,
 :Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad
 :That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
S:
 :Since every Jack became a gentleman,
 :
 :There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
 :
 :Gloucester.
 :You envy my advancement, and my friends'.
 :God grant we never may have need of you.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Meantime God grants that we have need of
S:
 :you.
 :
 :Our brother is imprisoned by your means,
 :
S:Myself disgraced, and the nobility
 :
 :Held in contempt, while great promotions
 :
S:Are daily given to ennoble those
 :
 :That scarce some two days since were worth a
 :
S:noble.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :By Him that raised me to this careful height
 :From that contented hap which I enjoyed,
 :I never did incense his Majesty
 :Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
 :An earnest advocate to plead for him.
 :My lord, you do me shameful injury
S:
 :Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:You may deny that you were not the mean
 :
 :Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
 :
 :
 :
 :RIVERS  She may, my lord, for--
 :
 :RICHARD
 :She may, Lord Rivers. Why, who knows not so?
 :She may do more, sir, than denying that.
 :She may help you to many fair preferments
S:
 :And then deny her aiding hand therein,
 :
 :And lay those honors on your high desert.
 :
 :What may she not? She may, ay, marry, may she--
 :
 :
 :RIVERS  What, marry, may she?
 :
 :RICHARD
 :What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
S:
S:A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
 :
 :Iwis, your grandam had a worser match.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
S:Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
 :
 :By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
 :
 :Of those gross taunts that oft I have endured.
 :
 :I had rather be a country servant-maid
 :Than a great queen with this condition,
 :To be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.
 :
 :[Enter old Queen Margaret, apart from the others.]
 :
S:
 :Small joy have I in being England's queen.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
S:And lessened be that small, God I beseech Him!
 :
 :Thy honor, state, and seat is due to me.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
S:What, threat you me with telling of the King?
 :
 :Tell him and spare not. Look, what I have said,
 :
 :I will avouch 't in presence of the King;
 :
 :I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tower.
S:'Tis time to speak. My pains are quite forgot.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :Out, devil! I do remember them too well:
 :Thou killed'st my husband Henry in the Tower,
 :And Edward, my poor son, at Tewkesbury.
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,
S:
 :I was a packhorse in his great affairs,
 :
S:A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
 :
 :A liberal rewarder of his friends.
 :
S:To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :
 :In all which time, you and your husband Grey
 :
 :Were factious for the House of Lancaster.--
 :And, Rivers, so were you.--Was not your husband
 :In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
 :Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
 :What you have been ere this, and what you are;
S:Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick,
 :Ay, and forswore himself--which Jesu pardon!--
 :
S:
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]  Which God revenge!
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
 :And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
 :I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's,
 :Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine.
S:I am too childish-foolish for this world.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,
 :Thou cacodemon! There thy kingdom is.
 :
 :RIVERS
 :My lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
 :Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
S:
 :We followed then our lord, our sovereign king.
 :
 :So should we you, if you should be our king.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :If I should be? I had rather be a peddler.
 :
 :Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
 :You should enjoy were you this country's king,
 :As little joy you may suppose in me
S:That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [aside]
 :
 :As little joy enjoys the queen thereof,
 :For I am she, and altogether joyless.
 :I can no longer hold me patient.
 :[She steps forward.]
 :Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
 :In sharing that which you have pilled from me!
S:
 :Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
 :
S:If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects,
 :
 :Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels.--
 :
 :Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
 :
 :sight?
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :But repetition of what thou hast marred.
S:That will I make before I let thee go.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
 :
S:QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :I was, but I do find more pain in banishment
 :
 :Than death can yield me here by my abode.
 :
 :A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
 :[To Queen Elizabeth.] And thou a kingdom;--all
 :of you, allegiance.
 :This sorrow that I have by right is yours,
 :And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :The curse my noble father laid on thee
 :
S:When thou didst crown his warlike brows with
 :
 :paper,
 :
 :And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
 :
 :And then, to dry them, gav'st the Duke a clout
 :Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
 :His curses then, from bitterness of soul
 :Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee,
 :And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :So just is God to right the innocent.
 :
 :
S:HASTINGS
 :
 :O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
 :
 :And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
 :
 :
S:RIVERS
 :
 :Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORSET
 :No man but prophesied revenge for it.
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :What, were you snarling all before I came,
 :
 :Ready to catch each other by the throat,
 :And turn you all your hatred now on me?
 :Did York's dread curse prevail so much with
 :heaven
 :That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
 :Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
S:
 :Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
 :
S:Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
 :
 :Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick
 :
 :curses!
 :
 :Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
 :As ours by murder to make him a king.
 :[To Queen Elizabeth.] Edward thy son, that now is
 :Prince of Wales,
 :For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
 :Die in his youth by like untimely violence.
S:
 :Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
 :
 :Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self.
 :
 :Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's death
 :
 :And see another, as I see thee now,
 :Decked in thy rights, as thou art stalled in mine.
 :Long die thy happy days before thy death,
 :And, after many lengthened hours of grief,
 :Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen.--
S:
 :Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,
 :
 :And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
 :
 :Was stabbed with bloody daggers. God I pray Him
 :
 :That none of you may live his natural age,
 :But by some unlooked accident cut off.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.
S:
 :
 :
S:QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear
 :
 :me.
 :
 :If heaven have any grievous plague in store
 :Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
 :O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
 :And then hurl down their indignation
 :On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace.
 :The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.
S:
 :Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
 :
 :And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends.
 :
 :No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
 :
S:Unless it be while some tormenting dream
 :
 :Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils.
 :
S:Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog,
 :
 :Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity
 :
 :The slave of nature and the son of hell,
 :
 :Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
 :Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
 :Thou rag of honor, thou detested--
S:
 :
 :RICHARD  Margaret.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET  Richard!
 :
 :RICHARD  Ha?
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET  I call thee not.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
S:I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think
 :
 :That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.
 :O, let me make the period to my curse!
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :'Tis done by me and ends in "Margaret."
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH, [to Queen Margaret]
 :Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
S:Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune,
 :
 :Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
 :
 :Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
 :
 :Fool, fool, thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
 :The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
 :To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-backed
 :toad.
 :
S:HASTINGS
 :
 :False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
 :
S:Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.
 :
 :RIVERS
S:Were you well served, you would be taught your
 :
 :duty.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :To serve me well, you all should do me duty:
 :Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.
 :O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
 :
S:DORSET, [to Rivers]
 :
 :Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
S:Peace, Master Marquess, you are malapert.
 :
 :Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.
 :
 :O, that your young nobility could judge
 :
 :What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
 :They that stand high have many blasts to shake
 :them,
 :And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
S:Good counsel, marry.--Learn it, learn it, marquess.
 :
 :
 :
 :DORSET
 :
S:It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Ay, and much more; but I was born so high.
 :Our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top,
 :And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :And turns the sun to shade. Alas, alas,
S:
 :Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
 :
S:Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
 :
 :Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
 :
S:Your aerie buildeth in our aerie's nest.
 :
 :O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
 :
 :As it is won with blood, lost be it so.
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
 :
 :[Addressing the others.] Uncharitably with me have
 :you dealt,
 :And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.
 :My charity is outrage, life my shame,
S:And in that shame still live my sorrows' rage.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Have done, have done.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy hand
 :In sign of league and amity with thee.
S:Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
 :
 :Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
 :
 :Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Nor no one here, for curses never pass
 :
 :The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
 :
 :
S:QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :I will not think but they ascend the sky,
 :
 :And there awake God's gentle sleeping peace.
 :
 :[Aside to Buckingham.] O Buckingham, take heed of
 :yonder dog!
 :Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
 :His venom tooth will rankle to the death.
 :Have not to do with him. Beware of him.
 :Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
S:
 :And all their ministers attend on him.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel,
 :And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
S:O, but remember this another day,
 :
 :When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
 :
 :And say poor Margaret was a prophetess.--
 :
 :Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
S:And he to yours, and all of you to God's.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
 :
 :RIVERS
 :And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :I cannot blame her. By God's holy mother,
 :
 :She hath had too much wrong, and I repent
 :
 :My part thereof that I have done to her.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :I never did her any, to my knowledge.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
 :
 :I was too hot to do somebody good
 :
 :That is too cold in thinking of it now.
 :Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
 :He is franked up to fatting for his pains.
 :God pardon them that are the cause thereof.
S:
 :
S:RIVERS
 :
 :A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion
 :
 :To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
 :
 :

 :So do I ever--[(speaks to himself)] being well advised,
 :For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

 :
 :
 :CATESBY
S:Madam, his Majesty doth call for you,--
 :
 :And for your Grace,--and yours, my gracious
 :
S:lords.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:Catesby, I come.--Lords, will you go with me?
 :
 :
 :
 :RIVERS  We wait upon your Grace.
 :
 :[All but Richard, Duke of Gloucester exit.]
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.
S:The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
 :
 :I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
 :
 :Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
 :
 :I do beweep to many simple gulls,
 :Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham,
 :And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
 :That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
 :Now they believe it and withal whet me
S:To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
 :
 :But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture,
 :
 :Tell them that God bids us do good for evil;
 :
 :And thus I clothe my naked villainy
 :With odd old ends stol'n forth of Holy Writ,
 :And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
 :
 :[Enter two Murderers.]

S:
 :But soft, here come my executioners.--

S:How now, my hardy, stout, resolved mates?
 :
 :Are you now going to dispatch this thing?

S:That we may be admitted where he is.

 :Well thought upon. I have it here about me.
 :[He gives a paper.]
 :When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
 :But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
 :Withal obdurate; do not hear him plead,
 :For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps
S:
 :May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MURDERER
 :
 :Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.
 :Talkers are no good doers. Be assured

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Clarence and Keeper.]
 :
 :
 :
S:KEEPER
 :
 :Why looks your Grace so heavily today?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :O, I have passed a miserable night,
 :So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
 :That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
S:I would not spend another such a night
 :
 :Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
 :
 :So full of dismal terror was the time.
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
S:What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
S:Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
 :
 :And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,
 :
 :And in my company my brother Gloucester,
 :
 :Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
 :Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward
 :England
S:And cited up a thousand heavy times,
 :
 :During the wars of York and Lancaster,
 :
 :That had befall'n us. As we paced along
 :
 :Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
S:Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
 :
 :Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
 :
 :Into the tumbling billows of the main.
 :
 :O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
 :What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
S:What sights of ugly death within my eyes.
 :
 :Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks,
 :
 :A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,
 :
 :Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
 :Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
 :All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
 :Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
 :Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept--
 :As 'twere in scorn of eyes--reflecting gems,
S:
 :That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep
 :
S:And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.
 :
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
 :
S:Had you such leisure in the time of death
 :
 :To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Methought I had, and often did I strive
 :To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
 :Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth
 :To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air,
 :But smothered it within my panting bulk,
S:
 :Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
 :
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
 :
S:Awaked you not in this sore agony?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
 :No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.
 :O, then began the tempest to my soul.
S:I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,
 :
 :With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
 :
 :Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
 :
S:The first that there did greet my stranger-soul
 :
 :Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
 :
S:Who spake aloud "What scourge for perjury
 :
 :Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"
 :
S:And so he vanished. Then came wand'ring by
 :
 :A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
 :
 :Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud
 :
 :"Clarence is come--false, fleeting, perjured
 :Clarence,
 :That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury.
 :Seize on him, furies. Take him unto torment."
 :With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
S:Environed me and howled in mine ears
 :
 :Such hideous cries that with the very noise
 :
 :I trembling waked, and for a season after
 :
 :Could not believe but that I was in hell,
S:Such terrible impression made my dream.
 :
 :
 :
 :KEEPER
 :
 :No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.
 :I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Ah keeper, keeper, I have done these things,
 :That now give evidence against my soul,
S:
 :For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me.--
 :
 :O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
 :
 :But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
 :
 :Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!
 :O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!--
 :Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.
 :My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
 :
S:
 :KEEPER
 :
 :I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
 :
 :[Clarence sleeps.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant.]
 :
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
S:
 :Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
 :
 :Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.
 :
 :Princes have but their titles for their glories,
 :
 :An outward honor for an inward toil,
 :And, for unfelt imaginations,
 :They often feel a world of restless cares,
 :So that between their titles and low name
 :There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter two Murderers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Ho, who's here?
S:
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
 :
 :What wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam'st thou
 :
 :hither?
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  I would speak with Clarence, and I
 :came hither on my legs.
 :
 :BRAKENBURY  What, so brief?
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.--
 :
 :Let him see our commission, and talk no more.
 :
 :[Brakenbury reads the commission.]
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
 :I am in this commanded to deliver
S:The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
 :
 :I will not reason what is meant hereby
 :
 :Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
 :
 :There lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys.
 :[He hands them keys.]
 :I'll to the King and signify to him
 :That thus I have resigned to you my charge.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  You may, sir. 'Tis a point of wisdom.
S:
 :Fare you well.
 :
 :[Brakenbury and the Keeper exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  What, shall I stab him as he
 :sleeps?
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  No. He'll say 'twas done cowardly,
 :
 :when he wakes.
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Why, he shall never wake until the
 :great Judgment Day.
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Why, then he'll say we stabbed him
 :
S:sleeping.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  The urging of that word "judgment"
 :
 :hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  What, art thou afraid?
S:
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Not to kill him, having a warrant,
 :
S:but to be damned for killing him, from the which
 :
 :no warrant can defend me.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  I thought thou hadst been resolute.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  So I am--to let him live.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester
S:and tell him so.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope
 :
 :this passionate humor of mine will change. It was
S:wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  How dost thou feel thyself now?
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
 :are yet within me.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Remember our reward when the
S:deed's done.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the
 :
 :reward.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Where's thy conscience now?
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  O, in the Duke of Gloucester's
 :purse.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  When he opens his purse to give us
 :
 :our reward, thy conscience flies out.
 :
S:
 :
S:SECOND MURDERER  'Tis no matter. Let it go. There's
 :
 :few or none will entertain it.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  What if it come to thee again?
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  I'll not meddle with it. It makes a
 :man a coward: a man cannot steal but it accuseth
 :him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man
 :cannot lie with his neighbor's wife but it detects
S:
 :him. 'Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies
 :
 :in a man's bosom. It fills a man full of
 :
S:obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold
 :
 :that by chance I found. It beggars any man that
 :
 :keeps it. It is turned out of towns and cities for a
 :
 :dangerous thing, and every man that means to live
 :well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
 :persuading me not to kill the Duke.
 :
S:
 :SECOND MURDERER  Take the devil in thy mind, and
 :
 :believe him not. He would insinuate with thee but
 :
 :to make thee sigh.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  I am strong-framed. He cannot prevail
 :
 :with me.
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Spoke like a tall man that respects
 :thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Take him on the costard with the
 :hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the
S:
 :malmsey butt in the next room.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  O, excellent device--and make a
 :
S:sop of him!
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Soft, he wakes.
 :
 :
S:SECOND MURDERER  Strike!
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  No, we'll reason with him.
 :
 :[Clarence wakes.]
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Where art thou, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
S:
 :You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
 :
S:
 :
S:CLARENCE
 :
 :In God's name, what art thou?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  A man, as you are.
 :
S:CLARENCE  But not, as I am, royal.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Nor you, as we are, loyal.
 :
 :
S:CLARENCE
 :
 :Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :My voice is now the King's, my looks mine own.
 :
S:CLARENCE
 :
 :How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
 :
 :Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
 :
 :Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  To, to, to--
S:
 :
 :CLARENCE  To murder me?
 :
 :
 :
 :BOTH  Ay, ay.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
 :And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
S:Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
 :Offended us you have not, but the King.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :I shall be reconciled to him again.
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
S:
 :Never, my lord. Therefore prepare to die.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
 :Are you drawn forth among a world of men
 :To slay the innocent? What is my offense?
 :Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
 :What lawful quest have given their verdict up
 :Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounced
S:
 :The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death
 :
 :Before I be convict by course of law?
 :
 :To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
 :
 :I charge you, as you hope to have redemption,
 :By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
 :That you depart, and lay no hands on me.
 :The deed you undertake is damnable.
 :
S:
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
S:What we will do, we do upon command.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
 :
 :And he that hath commanded is our king.
 :
 :CLARENCE
S:Erroneous vassals, the great King of kings
 :
 :Hath in the table of His law commanded
 :
S:That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
 :
S:Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man's?
 :
 :Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand
 :
 :To hurl upon their heads that break His law.
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
S:And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee
 :
 :For false forswearing and for murder too.
 :
 :Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
 :
 :In quarrel of the House of Lancaster.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :And, like a traitor to the name of God,
S:Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous
 :
 :blade
 :
 :Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
 :Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us
S:
S:When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
 :Alas! For whose sake did I that ill deed?
 :For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
 :He sends you not to murder me for this,
 :For in that sin he is as deep as I.
 :If God will be avenged for the deed,
 :O, know you yet He doth it publicly!
S:
 :Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm;
 :
 :He needs no indirect or lawless course
 :
 :To cut off those that have offended Him.
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
S:Who made thee then a bloody minister
 :
 :When gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet,
 :
 :That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
 :Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy faults
 :
 :Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :If you do love my brother, hate not me.
 :I am his brother, and I love him well.
 :If you are hired for meed, go back again,
S:
 :And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
 :
 :Who shall reward you better for my life
 :
 :Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
 :
 :
S:SECOND MURDERER
 :
S:You are deceived. Your brother Gloucester hates
 :
 :you.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :
 :O no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
 :
 :Go you to him from me.
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER  Ay, so we will.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Tell him, when that our princely father York
S:
 :Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,
 :
 :He little thought of this divided friendship.
 :
 :Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.
 :
S:CLARENCE
 :
 :O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
S:Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive
 :
 :yourself.
 :
 :'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,
 :And hugged me in his arms, and swore with sobs
 :That he would labor my delivery.
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
 :Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
 :
 :From this Earth's thralldom to the joys of heaven.
S:
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
 :
 :Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
 :
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Have you that holy feeling in your souls
 :To counsel me to make my peace with God,
 :And are you yet to your own souls so blind
 :That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
S:
 :O sirs, consider: they that set you on
 :
 :To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER, [to First Murderer]
 :What shall we do?
 :
 :CLARENCE  Relent, and save your souls.
S:Which of you--if you were a prince's son
 :
 :Being pent from liberty, as I am now--
 :
S:If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
 :
 :Would not entreat for life? Ay, you would beg,
 :
 :Were you in my distress.
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :Relent? No. 'Tis cowardly and womanish.
 :
 :CLARENCE
 :Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
S:
 :[To Second Murderer.] My friend, I spy some pity
 :
 :in thy looks.
 :
 :O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
 :
 :Come thou on my side and entreat for me.
 :A begging prince what beggar pities not?
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER  Look behind you, my lord.
 :
S:
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
S:Take that, and that. [(Stabs him.)] If all this will not
 :
 :do,
 :
 :I'll drown you in the malmsey butt within.
 :
 :[He exits with the body.]
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
 :A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.
 :How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
 :Of this most grievous murder.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter First Murderer.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :
 :How now? What mean'st thou that thou help'st me
 :
 :not?
 :By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you
 :have been.
 :
 :SECOND MURDERER
 :I would he knew that I had saved his brother.
S:
 :Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,
 :
 :For I repent me that the Duke is slain.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST MURDERER
 :So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
 :Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole
 :Till that the Duke give order for his burial.
 :And when I have my meed, I will away,
S:
 :For this will out, and then I must not stay.
 :
S:[He exits.]

S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :KING EDWARD
 :
 :Why, so. Now have I done a good day's work.
 :You peers, continue this united league.
 :I every day expect an embassage
 :From my Redeemer to redeem me hence,
 :And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven
S:

 :
 :Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand.
 :

S:

S:And I as I love Hastings with my heart.

S:KING EDWARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :
 :Madam, yourself is not exempt from this,--
 :
 :Nor you, son Dorset,--Buckingham, nor you.
 :
 :You have been factious one against the other.--
 :Wife, love Lord Hastings. Let him kiss your hand,
 :And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :There, Hastings, I will never more remember
S:
S:Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine.
 :

 :Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
 :With thy embracements to my wife's allies
 :And make me happy in your unity.
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :
 :Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
 :
 :Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
 :
S:Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
 :
 :With hate in those where I expect most love.
 :
 :When I have most need to employ a friend,
 :
 :And most assured that he is a friend,
 :Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile
 :Be he unto me: this do I beg of God,
S:When I am cold in love to you or yours.
 :
 :[Queen Elizabeth and Buckingham embrace.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KING EDWARD
 :A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
 :Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
 :There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
 :To make the blessed period of this peace.
 :
S:

 :
 :Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke.

 :
 :RICHARD
 :Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,
 :And, princely peers, a happy time of day.
 :
 :KING EDWARD
 :Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
S:
 :Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
 :
S:Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
 :
 :Between these swelling, wrong-incensed peers.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord.
 :
 :Among this princely heap, if any here
S:By false intelligence or wrong surmise
 :
 :Hold me a foe,
 :
S:If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
 :
 :Have aught committed that is hardly borne
 :
 :By any in this presence, I desire
 :
 :To reconcile me to his friendly peace.
 :'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
 :I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
 :First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
 :Which I will purchase with my duteous service;--
 :Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
S:
 :If ever any grudge were lodged between us;--
 :
 :Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset,
 :
 :That all without desert have frowned on me;--
 :
S:Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;--of you,
 :
 :Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
 :
 :I do not know that Englishman alive
 :
 :With whom my soul is any jot at odds
 :More than the infant that is born tonight.
 :I thank my God for my humility.

 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
S:
 :I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
 :
S:My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
 :
 :To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Why, madam, have I offered love for this,
 :To be so flouted in this royal presence?
 :Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?

S:Ay, my good lord, and no man in the presence

S:Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.

S:RICHARD

S:

 :Then say at once what is it thou requests.
 :
 :STANLEY
 :The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life,
S:
 :Who slew today a riotous gentleman
 :
 :Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
 :
 :
 :
 :KING EDWARD
 :Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
 :And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
 :My brother killed no man; his fault was thought,
 :And yet his punishment was bitter death.
S:
 :Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
 :
 :Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised?
 :
 :Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
 :
 :Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
 :The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
 :Who told me, in the field at Tewkesbury,
 :When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
 :And said "Dear brother, live, and be a king"?
S:
 :Who told me, when we both lay in the field
 :
 :Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
 :
 :Even in his garments and did give himself,
 :
 :All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?
 :All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
 :Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you
 :Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
 :But when your carters or your waiting vassals
S:
S:Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
 :
 :The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
 :
 :You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,
 :
 :And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.
 :[Stanley rises.]
 :But for my brother, not a man would speak,
 :Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
 :For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
 :Have been beholding to him in his life,
S:
 :Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
 :
 :O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold
 :
S:On me and you, and mine and yours for this!--

 :
S:How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
 :
 :Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?

 :=======
 :[Enter the old Duchess of York with the two
S:
 :children of Clarence.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BOY
 :
 :Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS  No, boy.
 :
 :
 :
S:DAUGHTER
 :
S:Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
 :
 :And cry "O Clarence, my unhappy son"?
 :
 :
 :
S:BOY
 :
 :Why do you look on us and shake your head,
 :
 :And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
 :
 :If that our noble father were alive?
 :
 :DUCHESS
S:My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
 :
 :I do lament the sickness of the King,
 :
 :As loath to lose him, not your father's death.
 :
 :It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
 :
S:BOY
 :
 :Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
 :
 :The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
 :
 :God will revenge it, whom I will importune
 :With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
 :
 :DAUGHTER  And so will I.
 :
 :DUCHESS
S:
 :Peace, children, peace. The King doth love you
 :
S:well.
 :
 :Incapable and shallow innocents,
 :
 :You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
 :
 :
 :BOY
 :Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester
S:Told me the King, provoked to it by the Queen,
 :
 :Devised impeachments to imprison him;
 :
S:And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
 :
 :And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek,
 :
 :Bade me rely on him as on my father,
 :
 :And he would love me dearly as a child.
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
 :Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
 :
 :And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice.
 :He is my son, ay, and therein my shame,
 :Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
 :
 :BOY
S:Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
 :
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS  Ay, boy.
 :
 :
 :
 :BOY
 :I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?
 :
 :[Enter Queen Elizabeth with her hair about her ears,
 :Rivers and Dorset after her.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
 :
 :To chide my fortune and torment myself?
 :I'll join with black despair against my soul
S:And to myself become an enemy.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
 :What means this scene of rude impatience?
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :To make an act of tragic violence.
 :Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
 :Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
 :Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
S:
 :If you will live, lament. If die, be brief,
 :
 :That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
 :
 :Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
 :
 :To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
 :As I had title in thy noble husband.
S:
 :I have bewept a worthy husband's death
 :
 :And lived with looking on his images;
 :
 :But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
 :
 :Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,
 :And I, for comfort, have but one false glass
 :That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
 :Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,
S:And hast the comfort of thy children left,
 :
 :But death hath snatched my husband from mine
 :
 :arms
 :
 :And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,
 :Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,
 :Thine being but a moiety of my moan,
 :To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!
 :
 :BOY, [to Queen Elizabeth]
S:
 :Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death.
 :
S:How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
 :
 :
 :
 :DAUGHTER, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :
 :Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned.
 :Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Give me no help in lamentation.
S:I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
 :
 :All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
 :
 :That I, being governed by the watery moon,
 :
 :May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.
 :Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
 :
S:CHILDREN
 :
 :Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
 :
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :What stay had I but Edward? And he's gone.
S:
 :
 :CHILDREN
 :
 :What stay had we but Clarence? And he's gone.
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :What stays had I but they? And they are gone.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:Was never widow had so dear a loss.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHILDREN
 :
 :Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :Was never mother had so dear a loss.
 :Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
 :Their woes are parceled; mine is general.
S:
 :She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
 :
 :I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.
 :
S:These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;
 :
 :I for an Edward weep; so do not they.
 :
 :Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,
 :
 :Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow's nurse,
 :And I will pamper it with lamentation.
 :
 :DORSET, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased
 :That you take with unthankfulness His doing.
S:
S:In common worldly things, 'tis called ungrateful
 :
 :With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
 :
 :Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
 :
S:Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
 :
 :For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
 :
 :
 :
 :RIVERS
 :Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
 :Of the young prince your son. Send straight for
 :him.
 :Let him be crowned. In him your comfort lives.
 :Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave
S:
S:And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Buckingham, Lord
 :
 :Stanley, Earl of Derby, Hastings, and Ratcliffe.]
 :
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
 :To wail the dimming of our shining star,
S:
 :But none can help our harms by wailing them.--
 :
 :Madam my mother, I do cry you mercy;
 :
 :I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
 :
 :I crave your blessing.	[He kneels.]
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,
 :Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.
S:
 :
 :
S:RICHARD, [standing]
 :
 :Amen. [Aside.] And make me die a good old man!
 :
 :That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
 :
 :I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
 :
 :That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
 :
 :Now cheer each other in each other's love.
S:Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
 :
 :We are to reap the harvest of his son.
 :
 :The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates,
 :
 :But lately splintered, knit, and joined together,
 :Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.
 :Meseemeth good that with some little train
 :Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
 :Hither to London, to be crowned our king.
 :
S:
S:RIVERS
 :
 :Why "with some little train," my lord of
 :
 :Buckingham?
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
 :The new-healed wound of malice should break out,
 :Which would be so much the more dangerous
 :By how much the estate is green and yet
S:
 :ungoverned.
 :
 :Where every horse bears his commanding rein
 :
 :And may direct his course as please himself,
 :
S:As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
 :
 :In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I hope the King made peace with all of us;
 :And the compact is firm and true in me.
 :
 :RIVERS
 :And so in me, and so, I think, in all.
S:
 :Yet since it is but green, it should be put
 :
 :To no apparent likelihood of breach,
 :
 :Which haply by much company might be urged.
 :
S:Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
 :
 :That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS  And so say I.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Then be it so, and go we to determine
 :Who they shall be that straight shall post to
S:Ludlow.--
 :
 :Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
 :
 :To give your censures in this business?
 :
 :[All but Buckingham and Richard exit.]
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
 :For God's sake let not us two stay at home.
 :For by the way I'll sort occasion,
S:
 :As index to the story we late talked of,
 :
 :To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :My other self, my council's consistory,
 :My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
 :I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
S:Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

 :
S:THIRD CITIZEN
 :
 :Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,

 :Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
S:

S:FIRST CITIZEN

 :Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD CITIZEN
 :Better it were they all came by his father,
 :Or by his father there were none at all,
 :For emulation who shall now be nearest
 :Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.
 :O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,
S:

 :
S:And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
 :
 :This sickly land might solace as before.

 :Come, come, we fear the worst. All will be well.

S:When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;

 :Before the days of change, still is it so.

 :
 :But leave it all to God. Whither away?

S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :You are too senseless obstinate, my lord,
 :
S:Too ceremonious and traditional.
 :
 :Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
 :
 :You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
 :
 :The benefit thereof is always granted
 :To those whose dealings have deserved the place
 :And those who have the wit to claim the place.
 :This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it
 :And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
 :Then taking him from thence that is not there,
S:
 :You break no privilege nor charter there.
 :
S:Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,
 :
 :But sanctuary children, never till now.
 :
 :
 :
 :CARDINAL
 :My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.--
S:Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
 :
S:
 :
 :HASTINGS  I go, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
 :[The Cardinal and Hastings exit.]
 :Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
 :Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Where it seems best unto your royal self.
 :
 :If I may counsel you, some day or two
 :
 :Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower;
 :Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
S:For your best health and recreation.
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :
 :I do not like the Tower, of any place.--
 :Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
 :
 :Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :Is it upon record, or else reported
S:Successively from age to age, he built it?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Upon record, my gracious lord.
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :But say, my lord, it were not registered,
 :Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
 :As 'twere retailed to all posterity,
S:Even to the general all-ending day.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD, [aside]
 :
 :So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
 :
 :
 :
S:PRINCE  What say you, uncle?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:I say, without characters fame lives long.
 :
 :[Aside.] Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,
 :
 :I moralize two meanings in one word.
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :That Julius Caesar was a famous man.
 :With what his valor did enrich his wit,
 :His wit set down to make his valor live.
 :Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,
S:
 :For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
 :
 :I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham--
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM  What, my gracious lord?
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :
 :An if I live until I be a man,
 :I'll win our ancient right in France again
 :Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD, [aside]
 :
 :Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
 :
 :
 :[Enter young Duke of York, Hastings, and the
 :Cardinal.]
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Now in good time here comes the Duke of York.
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
S:Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
 :
 :
 :
S:YORK
 :
 :Well, my dread lord--so must I call you now.
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
 :Too late he died that might have kept that title,
 :Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?
 :
S:
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord,
 :
 :You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
 :The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :He hath, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK  And therefore is he idle?
 :
 :RICHARD
S:O my fair cousin, I must not say so.
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :Then he is more beholding to you than I.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :He may command me as my sovereign,
 :But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
S:
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.
 :
 :PRINCE  A beggar, brother?
 :
S:
 :YORK
 :
 :Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
 :
 :And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
 :
 :YORK
S:
 :A greater gift? O, that's the sword to it.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
 :
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.
 :In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
 :
S:
 :
 :YORK
 :
 :I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
 :
 :YORK
 :I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  How?
 :
 :
 :
S:YORK  Little.
 :
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :
 :My lord of York will still be cross in talk.
 :Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
 :
S:YORK
 :
 :You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.--
 :
 :Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
 :
 :Because that I am little, like an ape,
 :He thinks that you should bear me on your
 :shoulders.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM, [aside]
 :With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
S:
S:To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
 :
 :He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
 :
 :So cunning and so young is wonderful.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD, [to Prince]
 :My lord, will 't please you pass along?
 :Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
 :Will to your mother, to entreat of her
 :To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
S:
 :
 :
 :YORK, [to Prince]
 :
 :What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
 :
 :YORK
S:
 :I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Why, what should you fear?
 :
 :
 :YORK
 :Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
 :My grandam told me he was murdered there.
 :
S:
S:PRINCE  I fear no uncles dead.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Nor none that live, I hope.
 :
 :
 :PRINCE
 :An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
 :[To York.] But come, my lord. With a heavy heart,
 :Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
 :[A sennet. Prince Edward, the Duke of York,
S:
 :and Hastings exit. Richard, Buckingham,
 :
S:and Catesby remain.]
 :
S:
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM, [to Richard]
 :
 :Think you, my lord, this little prating York
 :
S:Was not incensed by his subtle mother
 :
 :To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a parlous boy,
 :Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
S:He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Well, let them rest.--Come hither, Catesby.
 :
 :Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
 :
 :As closely to conceal what we impart.
S:Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way.
 :
 :What thinkest thou? Is it not an easy matter
 :
 :To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
 :
S:For the installment of this noble duke
 :
 :In the seat royal of this famous isle?
 :
 :
 :
S:CATESBY
 :
 :He, for his father's sake, so loves the Prince
 :
 :That he will not be won to aught against him.
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?
S:
 :
 :CATESBY
 :
 :He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
S:And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
 :
 :How he doth stand affected to our purpose
 :
 :And summon him tomorrow to the Tower
 :
 :To sit about the coronation.
 :If thou dost find him tractable to us,
 :Encourage him and tell him all our reasons.
 :If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
 :Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
 :And give us notice of his inclination;
S:
 :For we tomorrow hold divided councils,
 :
 :Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby,
 :
 :His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
 :
 :Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,
S:And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
 :
 :Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
 :
 :CATESBY
 :My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
 :
 :
 :
 :CATESBY  You shall, my lord.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
 :[Catesby exits.]
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:
 :Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive
 :
S:Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Chop off his head. Something we will determine.
 :And look when I am king, claim thou of me
 :The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables
 :Whereof the King my brother was possessed.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:
 :I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
 :
 :Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
 :We may digest our complots in some form.

 :Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER, [knocking]  My lord, my lord.
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS, [within]  Who knocks?
 :
 :MESSENGER  One from the Lord Stanley.
 :
 :HASTINGS, [within]  What is 't o'clock?
S:
 :
 :
S:MESSENGER  Upon the stroke of four.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lord Hastings.]
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
S:Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :So it appears by that I have to say.
 :First, he commends him to your noble self.
S:
 :
 :HASTINGS  What then?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :Then certifies your Lordship that this night
 :He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
 :Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
 :And that may be determined at the one
 :Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
S:
 :Therefore he sends to know your Lordship's
 :
 :pleasure,
 :
 :If you will presently take horse with him
 :
 :And with all speed post with him toward the north
 :To shun the danger that his soul divines.
 :
S:HASTINGS
 :
 :Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord.
 :
 :Bid him not fear the separated council.
 :
 :His Honor and myself are at the one,
S:And at the other is my good friend Catesby,
 :
 :Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 :
 :Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
 :
 :Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.
 :And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
 :To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.
 :To fly the boar before the boar pursues
 :Were to incense the boar to follow us
 :And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
S:
 :Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,
 :
 :And we will both together to the Tower,
 :
 :Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.
 :
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter Catesby.]
 :
S:
 :
 :CATESBY
 :
 :Many good morrows to my noble lord.
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :Good morrow, Catesby. You are early stirring.
S:What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?
 :
 :
 :
 :CATESBY
 :
 :It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,
 :And I believe will never stand upright
 :Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :How "wear the garland"? Dost thou mean the
S:
 :crown?
 :
 :
 :
 :CATESBY  Ay, my good lord.
 :
S:
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
 :
 :Before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced.
 :But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
 :
 :CATESBY
 :Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward
S:Upon his party for the gain thereof;
 :
 :And thereupon he sends you this good news,
 :
 :That this same very day your enemies,
 :
 :The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
S:
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
 :
 :Because they have been still my adversaries.
S:But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
 :
 :To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
 :
 :God knows I will not do it, to the death.
 :
 :
 :CATESBY
 :God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.
 :
 :HASTINGS
S:But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
 :
 :That they which brought me in my master's hate,
 :
 :I live to look upon their tragedy.
 :
 :Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older
 :I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't.
 :
 :CATESBY
 :'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
S:When men are unprepared and look not for it.
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
S:With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
 :
 :With some men else that think themselves as safe
 :
 :As thou and I, who, as thou know'st, are dear
 :
 :To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
 :
 :CATESBY
 :The Princes both make high account of you--
 :[Aside.] For they account his head upon the Bridge.
S:
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :I know they do, and I have well deserved it.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Lord Stanley.]
 :
S:
 :
 :Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man?
 :
 :Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :My lord, good morrow.--Good morrow, Catesby.--
 :You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood,
 :I do not like these several councils, I.
 :
S:
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours,
 :
S:And never in my days, I do protest,
 :
 :Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
 :
 :Think you but that I know our state secure,
 :
 :I would be so triumphant as I am?
 :
S:STANLEY
 :
 :The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
 :
 :Were jocund and supposed their states were sure,
 :
 :And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
 :But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
 :This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt.
 :Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
 :What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
 :
S:
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Come, come. Have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
 :
 :Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
 :Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
 :But come, my lord, let's away.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Pursuivant.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Go on before. I'll talk with this good fellow.
 :[Lord Stanley and Catesby exit.]
 :How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee?
 :
 :PURSUIVANT
S:The better that your Lordship please to ask.
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
 :Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet.
 :Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
 :By the suggestion of the Queen's allies.
 :But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
 :This day those enemies are put to death,
S:
 :And I in better state than e'er I was.
 :
 :
 :
 :PURSUIVANT
 :
S:God hold it, to your Honor's good content!
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me.
S:[Throws him his purse.]
 :
 :
 :

 :Well met, my lord. I am glad to see your Honor.
 :

 :I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
S:I am in your debt for your last exercise.
 :
 :Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.

 :PRIEST  I'll wait upon your Lordship.	[Priest exits.]
S:

 :What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain?
 :Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
 :Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
 :
S:
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
 :
 :The men you talk of came into my mind.
 :
 :What, go you toward the Tower?
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there.
S:I shall return before your Lordship thence.
 :
 :
 :
 :HASTINGS
 :
 :Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.

S:[He shows his arm.]

 :Look how I am bewitched! Behold mine arm

S:Is like a blasted sapling withered up;

S:And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,

 :

 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy
 :
 :color,
 :
 :Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
 :And then again begin, and stop again,
S:As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,
S:Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,
 :
 :Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
 :
 :Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
 :
 :Are at my service, like enforced smiles,
 :And both are ready, in their offices,
 :At any time to grace my stratagems.
 :But what, is Catesby gone?
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
S:He is; and see he brings the Mayor along.
 :
 :
 :

S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Lord Mayor--
 :

S:[Catesby exits.]

 :BUCKINGHAM  Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent--
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies.
S:
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
S:God and our innocence defend and guard us!
 :
 :
 :

 :
S:
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Be patient. They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.
 :
 :
 :LOVELL
 :Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
 :The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :So dear I loved the man that I must weep.
 :
 :I took him for the plainest harmless creature
 :
 :That breathed upon the Earth a Christian;
 :
S:Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
 :
 :The history of all her secret thoughts.
 :
 :So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue
 :
 :That, his apparent open guilt omitted--
 :I mean his conversation with Shore's wife--
 :He lived from all attainder of suspects.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:Well, well, he was the covert'st sheltered traitor
 :
 :That ever lived.--
 :
 :Would you imagine, or almost believe,
 :
 :Were 't not that by great preservation
 :We live to tell it, that the subtle traitor
S:This day had plotted, in the council house,
 :
 :To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester?
 :
 :
 :
S:MAYOR  Had he done so?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
 :Or that we would, against the form of law,
 :Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death,
 :But that the extreme peril of the case,
 :The peace of England, and our persons' safety
 :Enforced us to this execution?
S:
 :
 :
 :MAYOR
 :
 :Now fair befall you! He deserved his death,
 :
S:And your good Graces both have well proceeded
 :
 :To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :I never looked for better at his hands
 :After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
 :Yet had we not determined he should die
 :Until your Lordship came to see his end
S:(Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
 :
 :Something against our meanings, have prevented),
 :
 :Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
 :
S:The traitor speak and timorously confess
 :
 :The manner and the purpose of his treasons,
 :
 :That you might well have signified the same
 :
 :Unto the citizens, who haply may
 :Misconster us in him, and wail his death.
 :
 :MAYOR
 :But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve
 :As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
S:
S:And do not doubt, right noble princes both,
 :
 :But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
 :
 :With all your just proceedings in this case.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :And to that end we wished your Lordship here,
 :
 :T' avoid the censures of the carping world.
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
S:Which since you come too late of our intent,
 :
 :Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
 :
 :And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
 :
 :[Mayor exits.]
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Go after, after, cousin Buckingham.
 :
 :The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.
 :
 :There, at your meetest vantage of the time,
 :
 :Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
 :Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
S:Only for saying he would make his son
 :
 :Heir to the Crown--meaning indeed his house,
 :
 :Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so.
 :
 :Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
S:And bestial appetite in change of lust,
 :
S:Which stretched unto their servants, daughters,
 :
 :wives,
 :
 :Even where his raging eye or savage heart,
 :
 :Without control, lusted to make a prey.
 :Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
 :Tell them when that my mother went with child
 :Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
 :My princely father then had wars in France,
 :And, by true computation of the time,
S:
 :Found that the issue was not his begot,
 :
S:Which well appeared in his lineaments,
 :
S:Being nothing like the noble duke my father.
 :
 :Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
 :
 :Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Doubt not, my lord. I'll play the orator
 :As if the golden fee for which I plead
 :Were for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle,
 :
 :Where you shall find me well accompanied
 :
 :With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :I go; and towards three or four o'clock
 :Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
S:
 :[Buckingham exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaa.
 :[To Ratcliffe.] Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them
 :both
 :Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
S:[Ratcliffe and Lovell exit.]
 :
 :Now will I go to take some privy order
 :
 :To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
 :
 :And to give order that no manner person
 :Have any time recourse unto the Princes.

 :=======
 :[Enter Richard and Buckingham at several doors.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :How now, how now? What say the citizens?
 :
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
 :
 :The citizens are mum, say not a word.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children?
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy
 :
 :And his contract by deputy in France;
 :
 :Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire
S:And his enforcement of the city wives;
 :
 :His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
 :
S:As being got, your father then in France,
 :
 :And his resemblance being not like the Duke.
 :
 :Withal, I did infer your lineaments,
 :
 :Being the right idea of your father,
S:Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
 :
 :Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
 :
 :Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
 :
 :Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
 :Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
 :Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.
 :And when mine oratory drew toward end,
 :I bid them that did love their country's good
 :Cry "God save Richard, England's royal king!"
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  And did they so?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :No. So God help me, they spake not a word
 :But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
 :Stared each on other and looked deadly pale;
 :Which when I saw, I reprehended them
S:
 :And asked the Mayor what meant this willful silence.
 :
 :His answer was, the people were not used
 :
 :To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
 :
 :Then he was urged to tell my tale again:
 :"Thus saith the Duke. Thus hath the Duke
 :inferred"--
 :But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
 :When he had done, some followers of mine own,
S:
 :At lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,
 :
 :And some ten voices cried "God save King Richard!"
 :
S:And thus I took the vantage of those few.
 :
 :"Thanks, gentle citizens and friends," quoth I.
 :
 :"This general applause and cheerful shout
 :
S:Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard"--
 :
 :And even here brake off and came away.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :What tongueless blocks were they! Would they not
 :speak?
S:Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
 :Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit.
 :And look you get a prayer book in your hand
 :And stand between two churchmen, good my lord,
 :For on that ground I'll make a holy descant.
 :And be not easily won to our requests.
S:
S:Play the maid's part: still answer "nay," and take it.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :I go. An if you plead as well for them
 :
 :As I can say "nay" to thee for myself,
 :No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
 :[Knocking within.]
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:Go, go, up to the leads. The Lord Mayor knocks.
 :
 :[Richard exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter the Mayor and Citizens.]
 :
 :Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here.
 :I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.
 :
S:[Enter Catesby.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
 :
 :
S:CATESBY
 :
 :He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
 :
 :To visit him tomorrow or next day.
 :
 :He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
S:Divinely bent to meditation,
 :
 :And in no worldly suits would he be moved
 :
S:To draw him from his holy exercise.
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.
 :
 :Tell him myself, the Mayor, and aldermen,
 :
 :In deep designs, in matter of great moment
 :No less importing than our general good,
 :Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
 :
S:CATESBY
 :
S:I'll signify so much unto him straight.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
 :
 :He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
 :
 :But on his knees at meditation;
 :Not dallying with a brace of courtesans,
 :But meditating with two deep divines;
S:Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
 :
S:But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
 :
 :Happy were England would this virtuous prince
 :
 :Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof.
 :
 :But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.
 :
 :MAYOR
 :Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay.
S:
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Catesby.]
 :
 :Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?
 :
 :CATESBY
 :He wonders to what end you have assembled
S:
S:Such troops of citizens to come to him,
 :
 :His Grace not being warned thereof before.
 :
 :He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Sorry I am my noble cousin should
S:Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
 :
 :By heaven, we come to him in perfect love,
 :
 :And so once more return and tell his Grace.
 :
 :[Catesby exits.]
 :When holy and devout religious men
 :Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,
 :So sweet is zealous contemplation.
 :
 :[Enter Richard aloft, between two Bishops.]
S:
 :[Catesby reenters.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:MAYOR
 :
 :See where his Grace stands, 'tween two clergymen.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
 :To stay him from the fall of vanity;
 :And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
S:True ornaments to know a holy man.--
 :
 :Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
 :
 :Lend favorable ear to our requests,
 :
 :And pardon us the interruption
 :Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :My lord, there needs no such apology.
 :
 :I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
S:Who, earnest in the service of my God,
 :
 :Deferred the visitation of my friends.
 :
 :But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above
 :
 :And all good men of this ungoverned isle.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :I do suspect I have done some offense
 :
S:That seems disgracious in the city's eye,
 :
 :And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
 :
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :You have, my lord. Would it might please your
 :
 :Grace,
S:On our entreaties, to amend your fault.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Know, then, it is your fault that you resign
 :
 :The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
S:The sceptered office of your ancestors,
 :
 :Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,
 :
 :The lineal glory of your royal house,
 :
 :To the corruption of a blemished stock,
S:Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
 :
 :Which here we waken to our country's good,
 :
 :The noble isle doth want her proper limbs--
 :
 :Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
S:Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
 :
 :And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf
 :
 :Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion;
 :
 :Which to recure, we heartily solicit
S:Your gracious self to take on you the charge
 :
 :And kingly government of this your land,
 :
 :Not as Protector, steward, substitute,
 :
 :Or lowly factor for another's gain,
 :But as successively, from blood to blood,
 :Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
 :For this, consorted with the citizens,
 :Your very worshipful and loving friends,
S:And by their vehement instigation,
 :
 :In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I cannot tell if to depart in silence
S:Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
 :
 :Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
 :
 :If not to answer, you might haply think
 :
 :Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
 :To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
 :Which fondly you would here impose on me.
 :If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
 :So seasoned with your faithful love to me,
 :Then on the other side I checked my friends.
S:
 :Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
 :
 :And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
 :
 :Definitively thus I answer you:
 :
 :Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
 :Unmeritable shuns your high request.
 :First, if all obstacles were cut away
 :And that my path were even to the crown
 :As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
S:
 :Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
 :
 :So mighty and so many my defects,
 :
 :That I would rather hide me from my greatness,
 :
 :Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
 :Than in my greatness covet to be hid
 :And in the vapor of my glory smothered.
 :But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,
 :And much I need to help you, were there need.
S:
 :The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
 :
 :Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,
 :
 :Will well become the seat of majesty,
 :
 :And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
 :On him I lay that you would lay on me,
 :The right and fortune of his happy stars,
 :Which God defend that I should wring from him.
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
S:My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,
 :
S:But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
 :
 :All circumstances well considered.
 :
S:You say that Edward is your brother's son;
 :
 :So say we too, but not by Edward's wife.
 :
 :For first was he contract to Lady Lucy--
 :
S:Your mother lives a witness to his vow--
 :
 :And afterward by substitute betrothed
 :
 :To Bona, sister to the King of France.
 :
S:These both put off, a poor petitioner,
 :
 :A care-crazed mother to a many sons,
 :
 :A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
 :
 :Even in the afternoon of her best days,
 :Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
 :Seduced the pitch and height of his degree
S:To base declension and loathed bigamy.
 :
 :By her in his unlawful bed he got
 :
 :This Edward, whom our manners call "the Prince."
 :
 :More bitterly could I expostulate,
 :Save that, for reverence to some alive,
 :I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
S:Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
 :
 :This proffered benefit of dignity,
 :
 :If not to bless us and the land withal,
 :
 :Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
 :From the corruption of abusing times
 :Unto a lineal, true-derived course.
 :
 :MAYOR
 :Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.
S:
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.
 :
 :
 :
 :CATESBY
 :O, make them joyful. Grant their lawful suit.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
 :I am unfit for state and majesty.
S:
 :I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
 :
S:I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :If you refuse it, as in love and zeal
 :Loath to depose the child, your brother's son--
S:As well we know your tenderness of heart
 :
 :And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
 :
 :Which we have noted in you to your kindred
 :
 :And equally indeed to all estates--
 :Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
 :Your brother's son shall never reign our king,
 :But we will plant some other in the throne,
 :To the disgrace and downfall of your house.
 :And in this resolution here we leave you.--
S:
 :Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham!
 :
 :[Buckingham and some others exit.]
 :
 :
 :CATESBY
 :Call him again, sweet prince. Accept their suit.
 :If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
 :
 :Call them again. I am not made of stones,
 :
 :But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
 :
 :Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
 :
S:[Enter Buckingham and the rest.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Cousin of Buckingham and sage, grave men,
 :
 :Since you will buckle Fortune on my back,
S:To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
 :
 :I must have patience to endure the load;
 :
 :But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
 :
 :Attend the sequel of your imposition,
 :Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
 :From all the impure blots and stains thereof,
S:For God doth know, and you may partly see,
 :
 :How far I am from the desire of this.
 :
 :
 :
 :MAYOR
 :God bless your Grace! We see it and will say it.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Then I salute you with this royal title:
 :
 :Long live Richard, England's worthy king!
 :
S:
 :
 :ALL  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Even when you please, for you will have it so.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :Tomorrow, then, we will attend your Grace,
 :And so most joyfully we take our leave.
S:

 :RICHARD, [to the Bishops]
 :
 :Come, let us to our holy work again.--
 :
 :Farewell, my cousin. Farewell, gentle friends.

S:[Enter Brakenbury, the Lieutenant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :And in good time here the Lieutenant comes.--
 :
 :Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
 :How doth the Prince and my young son of York?
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
S:Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
 :
 :I may not suffer you to visit them.
 :
 :The King hath strictly charged the contrary.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :The King? Who's that?
 :
 :BRAKENBURY  I mean, the Lord Protector.
 :
S:
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
 :
 :Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
 :
 :I am their mother. Who shall bar me from them?
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :I am their father's mother. I will see them.
 :
 :ANNE
 :Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
S:
 :Then bring me to their sights. I'll bear thy blame
 :
 :And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRAKENBURY
 :No, madam, no. I may not leave it so.
 :I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
 :[Brakenbury the Lieutenant exits.]
S:
 :
 :[Enter Stanley.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:STANLEY
 :
 :Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence,
 :
 :And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
 :
 :And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
S:[To Anne.] Come, madam, you must straight to
 :
 :Westminster,
 :
 :There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
 :
S:
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH  Ah, cut my lace asunder
 :
 :That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
 :
S:Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :Despiteful tidings! O, unpleasing news!
 :
 :DORSET, [to Queen Elizabeth]
 :Be of good cheer, mother. How fares your Grace?
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:
 :O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.
 :
S:Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.
 :
S:Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
 :
 :If thou wilt outstrip death, go, cross the seas,
 :
 :And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
 :
 :Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,
 :Lest thou increase the number of the dead
S:And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
 :
 :Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
S:Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
 :
 :[To Dorset.] Take all the swift advantage of the
 :
 :hours.
 :
 :You shall have letters from me to my son
 :In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
 :Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
S:
 :O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
 :
 :A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world,
 :
 :Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
 :
 :
S:STANLEY, [to Anne]
 :
S:Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :
 :And I with all unwillingness will go.
 :O, would to God that the inclusive verge
 :Of golden metal that must round my brow
 :Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains!
 :Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
S:And die ere men can say "God save the Queen."
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory.
 :To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.
 :
 :ANNE
 :No? Why? When he that is my husband now
 :Came to me as I followed Henry's corse,
S:
 :When scarce the blood was well washed from his
 :
S:hands
 :
S:Which issued from my other angel husband
 :
 :And that dear saint which then I weeping followed--
 :
 :O, when, I say, I looked on Richard's face,
 :
 :This was my wish: be thou, quoth I, accursed
 :For making me, so young, so old a widow;
 :And, when thou wedd'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
 :And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
 :More miserable by the life of thee
 :Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.
S:
 :Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
 :
 :Within so small a time my woman's heart
 :
 :Grossly grew captive to his honey words
 :
 :And proved the subject of mine own soul's curse,
S:Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest,
 :
 :For never yet one hour in his bed
 :
 :Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
 :
 :But with his timorous dreams was still awaked.
S:Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
 :
 :And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining.
 :
 :ANNE
 :No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
 :
S:
 :DORSET
 :
 :Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANNE
 :Adieu, poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it.
 :
S:DUCHESS, [to Dorset]
 :
 :Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.
 :
 :[To Anne.] Go thou to Richard, and good angels
 :
S:tend thee.
 :
 :[To Queen Elizabeth.] Go thou to sanctuary, and
 :
S:good thoughts possess thee.
 :
 :I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.
 :
 :Eighty-odd years of sorrow have I seen,
 :
 :And each hour's joy wracked with a week of teen.
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.--
 :
S:Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
 :
 :Whom envy hath immured within your walls--
 :
 :Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
 :
S:Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
 :
 :For tender princes, use my babies well.
 :
S:So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Sound a sennet. Enter Richard in pomp; Buckingham,
 :Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovell, and others, including a Page.]
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Stand all apart.--Cousin of Buckingham.
 :
 :[The others move aside.]
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  My gracious sovereign.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Give me thy hand.
 :
 :[Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound trumpets.]
 :Thus high, by thy advice
 :And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
 :But shall we wear these glories for a day,
 :Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Still live they, and forever let them last.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
S:To try if thou be current gold indeed:
 :
 :Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Say on, my loving lord.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
S:
 :Why so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Ha! Am I king? 'Tis so--but Edward lives.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :True, noble prince.
 :
 :RICHARD  O bitter consequence
 :That Edward still should live "true noble prince"!
 :Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
 :Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,
S:
 :And I would have it suddenly performed.
 :
 :What sayst thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM  Your Grace may do your pleasure.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
S:Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
 :
 :
 :
S:BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,
 :
 :Before I positively speak in this.
 :
 :I will resolve you herein presently.
 :[Buckingham exits.]
S:
 :
S:CATESBY, [aside to the other Attendants]
 :
 :The King is angry. See, he gnaws his lip.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD, [aside]
 :I will converse with iron-witted fools
 :And unrespective boys. None are for me
 :That look into me with considerate eyes.
 :High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.--
 :Boy!
S:
 :
 :
S:PAGE, [coming forward]  My lord?
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
S:Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
 :
 :Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAGE
 :I know a discontented gentleman
S:Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
 :
 :Gold were as good as twenty orators,
 :
S:And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :What is his name?
S:
 :
 :PAGE  His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy.
 :[Page exits.]
 :[Aside.] The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
 :No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels.
 :Hath he so long held out with me, untired,
S:
 :And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Stanley.]
 :
S:
 :
 :How now, Lord Stanley, what's the news?
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY  Know, my loving lord,
 :The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled
 :To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
 :[He walks aside.]
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad
 :
 :That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
 :
 :I will take order for her keeping close.
S:Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
 :
 :Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.
 :
 :The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
 :
 :Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
 :That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.
 :About it, for it stands me much upon
 :To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
 :[Catesby exits.]
 :[Aside.] I must be married to my brother's daughter,
S:
 :Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
 :
 :Murder her brothers, and then marry her--
 :
 :Uncertain way of gain. But I am in
 :
S:So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
 :
 :Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Tyrrel.]
 :
 :Is thy name Tyrrel?
S:
 :
 :TYRREL
 :
 :James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Art thou indeed?
S:
 :
 :TYRREL  Prove me, my gracious lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
 :
 :
 :
S:TYRREL
 :
 :Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Why then, thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
 :Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
 :Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
 :Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
 :
S:
 :TYRREL
 :
 :Let me have open means to come to them,
 :
 :And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.
 :[Tyrrel approaches Richard and kneels.]
 :Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.
S:
 :[Tyrrel rises, and Richard whispers
 :
S:to him. Then Tyrrel steps back.]
 :
 :There is no more but so. Say it is done,
 :
 :And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
 :
 :
 :TYRREL  I will dispatch it straight.	[He exits.]
 :
 :[Enter Buckingham.]
 :
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :My lord, I have considered in my mind
 :
 :The late request that you did sound me in.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
 :
S:
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  I hear the news, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Stanley, he is your wife's son. Well, look unto it.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
 :For which your honor and your faith is pawned--
S:
S:Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
 :
 :Which you have promised I shall possess.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey
 :Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :What says your Highness to my just request?
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :I do remember me, Henry the Sixth
 :
 :Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
 :When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
 :A king perhaps--
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  My lord--
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:How chance the prophet could not at that time
 :
 :Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :My lord, your promise for the earldom--
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
 :The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle
S:
 :And called it Rougemont, at which name I started,
 :
 :Because a bard of Ireland told me once
 :
 :I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  My lord--
 :
 :RICHARD  Ay, what's o'clock?
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
 :I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
 :
 :Of what you promised me.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD  Well, but what's o'clock?
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Upon the stroke of ten.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD  Well, let it strike.
 :
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM  Why let it strike?
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Because that, like a jack, thou keep'st the stroke
 :Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
 :I am not in the giving vein today.
 :
S:
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :
S:Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.
 :
S:
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
 :
 :[He exits, and is followed by all but Buckingham.]
 :
 :
 :BUCKINGHAM
 :And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
 :With such contempt? Made I him king for this?
 :O, let me think on Hastings and be gone
S:To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

 :=======
 :[Enter Tyrrel.]
 :
 :
 :TYRREL
S:
 :The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
 :
S:The most arch deed of piteous massacre
 :
 :That ever yet this land was guilty of.
 :
 :Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
 :
 :To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
 :Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,
 :Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
 :Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
 :"O thus," quoth Dighton, "lay the gentle babes."
 :"Thus, thus," quoth Forrest, "girdling one another
S:
 :Within their alabaster innocent arms.
 :
S:Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
 :
 :And in their summer beauty kissed each other.
 :
 :A book of prayers on their pillow lay,
 :
 :Which once," quoth Forrest, "almost changed my
 :mind,
 :But, O, the devil--" There the villain stopped;
 :When Dighton thus told on: "We smothered
 :The most replenished sweet work of nature
S:That from the prime creation e'er she framed."
 :
 :Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;
 :
 :They could not speak; and so I left them both
 :
 :To bear this tidings to the bloody king.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Richard.]
 :
 :
 :
 :And here he comes.--All health, my sovereign lord.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
 :
S:TYRREL
 :
 :If to have done the thing you gave in charge
 :
 :Beget your happiness, be happy then,
 :
 :For it is done.
 :
 :RICHARD  But did'st thou see them dead?
S:
 :
 :TYRREL
 :
 :I did, my lord.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD  And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
 :
 :
 :
 :TYRREL
 :
 :The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,
 :But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper,
 :When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
S:
 :Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
 :
 :And be inheritor of thy desire.
 :
 :Farewell till then.
 :
S:
 :
 :TYRREL  I humbly take my leave.
 :
 :[Tyrrel exits.]
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :The son of Clarence have I pent up close,
 :His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage,
 :The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
S:And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.
 :
 :Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
 :
 :At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
 :
 :And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
 :To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.
S:

 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so bluntly?

S:RATCLIFFE

S:Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond,

 :And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen,
 :
 :Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
 :Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
 :Come, I have learned that fearful commenting
 :Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
S:
 :Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary;
 :
 :Then fiery expedition be my wing,
 :
 :Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king.

 :Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.

 :Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
S:
 :Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.

S:
 :

 :
 :Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave
 :
 :As thou canst yield a melancholy seat,
S:Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
 :
 :Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET, [coming forward]
 :If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
 :Give mine the benefit of seigniory,
 :And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
S:If sorrow can admit society,
 :
 :Tell over your woes again by viewing mine.
 :
 :I had an Edward till a Richard killed him;
 :
 :I had a husband till a Richard killed him.
 :Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him;
S:Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him.
 :
 :
 :

S:I had a Richard too, and thou did'st kill him;
 :
 :I had a Rutland too; thou holp'st to kill him.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.
 :From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
 :A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death--
 :That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
 :To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood;
S:
 :That excellent grand tyrant of the Earth,
 :
 :That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls;
 :
 :That foul defacer of God's handiwork
 :
 :Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
S:O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
 :
S:How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
 :
 :Preys on the issue of his mother's body
 :
 :And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
 :
 :
S:DUCHESS, [standing]
 :
 :O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
 :
 :God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :Bear with me. I am hungry for revenge,
 :And now I cloy me with beholding it.
S:Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward,
 :
 :Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
 :
 :Young York, he is but boot, because both they
 :
 :Matched not the high perfection of my loss.
 :Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward,
 :And the beholders of this frantic play,
 :Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
 :Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.
S:Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
 :
 :Only reserved their factor to buy souls
 :
 :And send them thither. But at hand, at hand
 :
 :Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
S:Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
 :
 :To have him suddenly conveyed from hence.
 :
 :Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray,
 :
S:That I may live and say "The dog is dead."
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH, [standing]

 :O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
 :That I should wish for thee to help me curse
S:That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :I called thee then "vain flourish of my fortune."
S:I called thee then poor shadow, "painted queen,"
 :
 :The presentation of but what I was,
 :
 :The flattering index of a direful pageant,
 :
 :One heaved a-high to be hurled down below,
 :A mother only mocked with two fair babes,
 :A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
 :To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
 :A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
 :A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
S:
S:Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
 :
 :Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
 :
 :Who sues and kneels and says "God save the
 :
 :Queen?"
 :Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
 :Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
 :Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
S:For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
 :
 :For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
 :
 :For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
 :
 :For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;
 :For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me;
 :For she being feared of all, now fearing one;
 :For she commanding all, obeyed of none.
 :Thus hath the course of justice whirled about
S:And left thee but a very prey to time,
 :
 :Having no more but thought of what thou wast
 :
 :To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
 :
 :Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
 :Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
 :Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke,
 :From which even here I slip my weary head
S:And leave the burden of it all on thee.
 :
 :Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance.
 :
 :These English woes shall make me smile in France.
 :
 :[She begins to exit.]
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile,
 :And teach me how to curse mine enemies.
S:
 :
S:QUEEN MARGARET
 :
 :Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
 :
 :Compare dead happiness with living woe;
 :
 :Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
 :And he that slew them fouler than he is.
 :Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.
S:Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

 :My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!
 :
 :QUEEN MARGARET
 :Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like
 :mine.	[Margaret exits.]
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
S:Why should calamity be full of words?
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Windy attorneys to their clients' woes,
S:Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
 :
 :Poor breathing orators of miseries,
 :
 :Let them have scope; though what they will impart
 :
 :Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.
S:
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
 :If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,
 :
 :And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
 :My damned son that thy two sweet sons smothered.
 :[A trumpet sounds.]
 :[The trumpet sounds.] Be copious in exclaims.
 :
S:[Enter King Richard and his train, including Catesby.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Who intercepts me in my expedition?
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :O, she that might have intercepted thee,
 :By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
S:
 :From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH, [to Richard]
 :
S:Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown
 :
 :Where should be branded, if that right were right,
 :
 :The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
 :
 :And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
 :Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?
 :
S:DUCHESS, [to Richard]
 :
 :Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence,
 :
 :And little Ned Plantagenet his son?
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH, [to Richard]
 :Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
 :
 :DUCHESS, [to Richard]  Where is kind Hastings?
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
 :
 :Let not the heavens hear these telltale women
 :
 :Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
 :[Flourish. Alarums.]
 :Either be patient and entreat me fair,
 :Or with the clamorous report of war
 :Thus will I drown your exclamations.
S:
 :
 :
S:DUCHESS  Art thou my son?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
 :
 :DUCHESS
S:Then patiently hear my impatience.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
 :That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :O, let me speak!
 :
S:
 :RICHARD  Do then, but I'll not hear.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
S:I will be mild and gentle in my words.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee,
 :God knows, in torment and in agony.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :And came I not at last to comfort you?
S:
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS
 :
 :No, by the Holy Rood, thou know'st it well.
 :
 :Thou cam'st on Earth to make the Earth my hell.
 :A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
 :Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
 :Thy school days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and
 :furious;
S:
 :Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
 :
 :Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
 :
 :More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred.
 :
 :What comfortable hour canst thou name,
 :That ever graced me with thy company?
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your
 :
 :Grace
 :
 :To breakfast once, forth of my company.
 :
 :If I be so disgracious in your eye,
S:Let me march on and not offend you, madam.--
 :
 :Strike up the drum.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS  I prithee, hear me speak.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :You speak too bitterly.
 :
 :
 :DUCHESS  Hear me a word,
 :For I shall never speak to thee again.
 :
 :RICHARD  So.
 :
S:
 :DUCHESS
 :
 :Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
 :
 :Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
 :
S:Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
 :
 :And nevermore behold thy face again.
 :
 :Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
 :
 :Which in the day of battle tire thee more
 :Than all the complete armor that thou wear'st.
 :My prayers on the adverse party fight,
 :And there the little souls of Edward's children
 :Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
S:And promise them success and victory.
 :
S:Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
 :
 :Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
 :
 :[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to
 :
 :curse
 :
S:Abides in me. I say amen to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :I have no more sons of the royal blood
 :
 :For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
S:They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,
 :
 :And therefore level not to hit their lives.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :You have a daughter called Elizabeth,
 :Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :And must she die for this? O, let her live,
S:
 :And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
 :
S:Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
 :
 :Throw over her the veil of infamy.
 :
 :So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,
 :
 :I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:
 :To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Her life is safest only in her birth.
 :
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:And only in that safety died her brothers.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
 :
S:
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
 :
 :My babes were destined to a fairer death
 :If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened
 :Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
 :Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts,
 :Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.
S:
 :No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
 :
S:Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
 :
 :To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
 :
 :But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
 :
S:My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
 :
 :Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,
 :
 :And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
 :
 :Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,
 :Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
 :
 :And dangerous success of bloody wars
 :
 :As I intend more good to you and yours
 :
 :Than ever you or yours by me were harmed!
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :What good is covered with the face of heaven,
 :
 :To be discovered, that can do me good?
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Th' advancement of your children, gentle lady.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Unto the dignity and height of fortune,
 :
 :The high imperial type of this Earth's glory.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:Flatter my sorrow with report of it.
 :
 :Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,
 :
 :Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Even all I have--ay, and myself and all--
 :
 :Will I withal endow a child of thine;
 :
 :So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
 :
 :Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
 :Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness
 :
 :Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:
 :My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  What do you think?
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
 :So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
 :And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
 :
S:I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
 :
 :And do intend to make her Queen of England.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be?
 :
S:
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :What, thou?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Even so. How think you of it?
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :How canst thou woo her?
 :
S:
 :RICHARD  That would I learn of you,
 :
S:As one being best acquainted with her humor.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  And wilt thou learn of me?
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Madam, with all my heart.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
 :A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
S:
S:"Edward" and "York." Then haply will she weep.
 :
 :Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
 :
 :Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland's blood--
 :
S:A handkerchief, which say to her did drain
 :
 :The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
 :
 :And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
 :
S:If this inducement move her not to love,
 :
S:Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
 :
 :Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
 :
 :Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake
 :
 :Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:You mock me, madam. This is not the way
 :
 :To win your daughter.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  There is no other way,
 :Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
 :And not be Richard, that hath done all this.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Say that I did all this for love of her.
S:
 :
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
 :
 :Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Look what is done cannot be now amended.
 :Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
 :Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
 :If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
S:
 :To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
 :
S:If I have killed the issue of your womb,
 :
 :To quicken your increase I will beget
 :
S:Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
 :
 :A grandam's name is little less in love
 :
 :Than is the doting title of a mother.
 :
 :They are as children but one step below,
 :Even of your metal, of your very blood,
 :Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
 :Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow.
 :Your children were vexation to your youth,
 :But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
S:
 :The loss you have is but a son being king,
 :
 :And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
 :
 :I cannot make you what amends I would;
 :
S:Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
 :
 :Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
 :
 :Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
 :
 :This fair alliance quickly shall call home
 :To high promotions and great dignity.
 :The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
 :Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother.
 :Again shall you be mother to a king,
 :And all the ruins of distressful times
S:
 :Repaired with double riches of content.
 :
 :What, we have many goodly days to see!
 :
 :The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
 :
 :Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,
 :Advantaging their love with interest
S:Of ten times double gain of happiness.
 :
 :Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.
 :
S:Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
 :
 :Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
 :
 :Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame
 :
 :Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess
 :With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;
 :And when this arm of mine hath chastised
 :The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,
 :Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
 :And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed,
S:
 :To whom I will retail my conquest won,
 :
 :And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :What were I best to say? Her father's brother
 :Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
 :Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
S:Under what title shall I woo for thee,
 :
 :That God, the law, my honor, and her love
 :
 :Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Tell her the King, that may command, entreats--
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :That, at her hands, which the King's King forbids.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:
 :Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
 :
 :
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:To vail the title, as her mother doth.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Say I will love her everlastingly.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:But how long shall that title "ever" last?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
 :
 :RICHARD
S:Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
S:An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :O no, my reasons are too deep and dead--
 :Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown--
S:
 :
 :
S:QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :
 :Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :I swear--
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  By nothing, for this is no oath.
 :Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor;
 :Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;
S:
 :Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
 :
S:If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,
 :
 :Swear then by something that thou hast not
 :
 :wronged.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Then, by myself--
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  Thyself is self-misused.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:Now, by the world--
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :My father's death--
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  Thy life hath it dishonored.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Why then, by God.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  God's wrong is most of all.
 :If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
 :The unity the King my husband made
 :Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
S:If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,
 :
 :Th' imperial metal circling now thy head
 :
 :Had graced the tender temples of my child,
 :
 :And both the Princes had been breathing here,
 :Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
 :Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
S:What canst thou swear by now?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  The time to come.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
S:For I myself have many tears to wash
 :
 :Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.
 :
 :The children live whose fathers thou hast
 :
 :slaughtered,
 :Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age;
 :The parents live whose children thou hast
 :butchered,
 :Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
 :Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast
S:
 :Misused ere used, by times ill-used o'erpast.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :As I intend to prosper and repent,
 :So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
S:Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound,
 :
 :Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours,
 :
 :Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest,
 :
 :Be opposite all planets of good luck
S:To my proceeding if, with dear heart's love,
 :
 :Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
 :
 :I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
 :
 :In her consists my happiness and thine.
S:Without her follows to myself and thee,
 :
 :Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
 :
 :Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
 :
 :It cannot be avoided but by this;
 :It will not be avoided but by this.
 :Therefore, dear mother--I must call you so--
 :Be the attorney of my love to her;
 :Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
S:Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
 :
 :Urge the necessity and state of times,
 :
 :And be not peevish found in great designs.
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
 :
 :
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
 :Shall I forget myself to be myself?
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong yourself.
 :
S:
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  Yet thou didst kill my children.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :But in your daughter's womb I bury them,
 :Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
 :Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH
S:
 :Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
S:And be a happy mother by the deed.
 :
S:
 :
 :QUEEN ELIZABETH  I go. Write to me very shortly,
 :
 :And you shall understand from me her mind.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
 :
 :[Queen exits.]
 :
 :Relenting fool and shallow, changing woman!
 :
 :[Enter Ratcliffe.]
 :
 :How now, what news?
S:
 :
 :RATCLIFFE
 :
S:Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
 :
 :Rideth a puissant navy. To our shores
 :
 :Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
 :
 :Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.
 :'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
 :And there they hull, expecting but the aid
S:Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
 :Norfolk--
 :Ratcliffe thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?
 :
 :CATESBY
 :Here, my good lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Catesby, fly to the Duke.
 :
 :
 :
S:CATESBY
 :
 :I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury.When thou com'st t
 :hither--[To Catesby.] Dull,
 :unmindful villain,
 :Why stay'st thou here and go'st not to the Duke?
 :
S:
S:CATESBY
 :
 :First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,
 :
 :What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :O true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
 :The greatest strength and power that he can make
 :And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
 :
S:
 :CATESBY  I go.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :RATCLIFFE
 :
 :What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
 :
S:
 :RATCLIFFE
 :
 :Your Highness told me I should post before.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :My mind is changed.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Lord Stanley.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Stanley, what news with you?
 :
 :STANLEY
 :None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing,
 :Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
 :
S:
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Hoyday, a riddle! Neither good nor bad.
 :
 :What need'st thou run so many miles about
 :
 :When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
 :Once more, what news?
S:
 :
 :STANLEY  Richmond is on the seas.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
S:There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
 :
 :White-livered runagate, what doth he there?
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
 :
 :RICHARD  Well, as you guess?
 :
S:STANLEY
 :
 :Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
 :
 :He makes for England, here to claim the crown.
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Is the chair empty? Is the sword unswayed?
 :
 :Is the King dead, the empire unpossessed?
 :
 :What heir of York is there alive but we?
 :And who is England's king but great York's heir?
 :Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
S:
 :
S:STANLEY
 :
S:Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
 :
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
 :
S:You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
 :
 :Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :No, my good lord. Therefore mistrust me not.
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
 :Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
S:
 :Are they not now upon the western shore,
 :
 :Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
 :
 :
 :
S:STANLEY
 :
 :No, my good lord. My friends are in the north.
 :
 :
 :
S:RICHARD
 :
 :Cold friends to me. What do they in the north
 :
 :When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :They have not been commanded, mighty king.
 :Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
 :I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
 :Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
S:
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond,
 :
 :But I'll not trust thee.
 :
 :STANLEY  Most mighty sovereign,
S:You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
 :
 :I never was nor never will be false.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD
 :Go then and muster men, but leave behind
S:Your son George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
 :
S:Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
 :
 :
 :
 :STANLEY
 :
 :So deal with him as I prove true to you.
 :[Stanley exits.]

 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :The news I have to tell your Majesty
 :Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
 :Buckingham's army is dispersed and scattered,
S:
 :And he himself wandered away alone,
 :
 :No man knows whither.
 :
 :
 :

S:FOURTH MESSENGER
 :
 :Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset,
 :
 :'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
 :
 :But this good comfort bring I to your Highness:
 :The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.
 :Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat
 :Unto the shore to ask those on the banks
 :If they were his assistants, yea, or no--
 :Who answered him they came from Buckingham
S:
 :Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
 :
 :Hoised sail and made his course again for Brittany.
 :
 :
 :

 :
S:Who prays continually for Richmond's good.

 :So much for that. The silent hours steal on,

 :
 :In brief, for so the season bids us be,
S:Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
 :
 :And put thy fortune to the arbitrament
 :
 :Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
 :
 :I, as I may--that which I would I cannot--
 :With best advantage will deceive the time
 :And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.
 :But on thy side I may not be too forward,
S:Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,

S:Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love

S:Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death.

S:And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!

S:All several sins, all used in each degree,

S:
 :
 :RICHMOND
 :
 :The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
 :
 :That ever entered in a drowsy head
 :Have I since your departure had, my lords.
 :Methought their souls whose bodies Richard
 :murdered
 :Came to my tent and cried on victory.
 :I promise you, my soul is very jocund
S:
 :In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
 :
 :How far into the morning is it, lords?

S:A LORD  Upon the stroke of four.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
S:
 :
S:His oration to his soldiers.
 :
 :
 :
 :More than I have said, loving countrymen,
 :
 :The leisure and enforcement of the time
 :Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this:
 :God, and our good cause, fight upon our side.
 :The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
S:Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
 :
 :Richard except, those whom we fight against
 :
 :Had rather have us win than him they follow.
 :
S:For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
 :
 :A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
 :
 :One raised in blood, and one in blood established;
 :
 :One that made means to come by what he hath,
 :And slaughtered those that were the means to help
 :him;
 :A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
 :Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
 :One that hath ever been God's enemy.
S:
 :Then if you fight against God's enemy,
 :
 :God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers.
 :
 :If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
 :
 :You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain.
S:If you do fight against your country's foes,
 :
 :Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire.
 :
 :If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
 :
 :Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors.
 :If you do free your children from the sword,
 :Your children's children quits it in your age.
 :Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
 :Advance your standards; draw your willing swords.
 :For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
S:
 :Shall be this cold corpse on the Earth's cold face,
 :
 :But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
 :
 :The least of you shall share his part thereof.
 :
 :Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.
 :God, and Saint George, Richmond, and victory!

S:

 :
 :

 :Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison my horse.--
 :Call up Lord Stanley; bid him bring his power.--
S:
 :I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
 :
 :And thus my battle shall be ordered:
 :
 :My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
 :
S:Consisting equally of horse and foot;
 :
 :Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
 :
S:John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
 :
 :Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
 :
 :They thus directed, we will follow
 :
 :In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
 :Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
 :This, and Saint George to boot!--What think'st
 :thou, Norfolk?
 :
 :NORFOLK
S:
 :A good direction, warlike sovereign.
 :
S:[He sheweth him a paper.]
 :
 :This found I on my tent this morning.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD [reads]
 :Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold.
 :For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.
 :A thing devised by the enemy.--
 :Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
 :Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls.
S:
 :Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
 :
 :Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.
 :
 :Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
 :
S:March on. Join bravely. Let us to it pell mell,
 :
 :If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
 :
 :
 :
 :His oration to his army.
 :
 :What shall I say more than I have inferred?
 :Remember whom you are to cope withal,
 :A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
S:A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,
 :
 :Whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
 :
 :To desperate adventures and assured destruction.
 :
 :You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
 :You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives,
 :They would restrain the one, distain the other.
S:And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
 :
S:Long kept in Brittany at our mother's cost,
 :
 :A milksop, one that never in his life
 :
 :Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow?
 :
 :Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again,
 :Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
 :These famished beggars weary of their lives,
 :Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
 :For want of means, poor rats, had hanged
 :themselves.
S:
 :If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
 :
 :And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers
 :
 :Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and
 :
 :thumped,
S:And in record left them the heirs of shame.
 :
 :Shall these enjoy our lands, lie with our wives,
 :
 :Ravish our daughters?	[Drum afar off.]
 :
 :Hark, I hear their drum.
 :Fight, gentlemen of England.--Fight, bold
 :yeomen.--
 :Draw, archers; draw your arrows to the head.--
 :Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood.
 :Amaze the welkin with your broken staves.--
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?
 :
S:MESSENGER  My lord, he doth deny to come.
 :
 :
 :
 :RICHARD  Off with his son George's head!
 :
 :
 :NORFOLK
 :My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.
 :After the battle let George Stanley die.
S:
 :
 :RICHARD
 :
 :A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
 :
S:Advance our standards. Set upon our foes.
 :
 :Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
 :
 :Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.
 :
 :Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.
 :[They exit.]

S:Lo, here this long-usurped royalty

 :England hath long been mad and scarred herself:
 :
 :The brother blindly shed the brother's blood;
 :The father rashly slaughtered his own son;
 :The son, compelled, been butcher to the sire.
 :All this divided York and Lancaster,
 :Divided in their dire division.
 :O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
S:
 :The true succeeders of each royal house,
 :
 :By God's fair ordinance conjoin together,
 :
S:And let their heirs, God, if Thy will be so,
 :
 :Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
 :
 :With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days.
 :
 :Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
 :That would reduce these bloody days again
 :And make poor England weep in streams of blood.
 :Let them not live to taste this land's increase,
 :That would with treason wound this fair land's peace.
 :Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again.
