 :[Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords,
 :with Musicians playing.]
 :
 :
S:
 :ORSINO
 :
S:If music be the food of love, play on.
 :
 :Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
 :
S:The appetite may sicken and so die.
 :
 :That strain again! It had a dying fall.
 :
 :O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
 :
 :That breathes upon a bank of violets,
 :Stealing and giving odor. Enough; no more.
 :'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
 :O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,
 :That, notwithstanding thy capacity
 :Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,
S:
 :Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
 :
 :But falls into abatement and low price
 :
 :Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy
 :
 :That it alone is high fantastical.
 :
 :CURIO
 :Will you go hunt, my lord?
 :
S:
 :ORSINO  What, Curio?
 :
S:
 :
 :CURIO  The hart.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
 :O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
 :Methought she purged the air of pestilence.
 :That instant was I turned into a hart,
S:And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
 :
 :E'er since pursue me.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Valentine.]
 :
 :How now, what news from her?
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
 :
 :But from her handmaid do return this answer:
 :
 :The element itself, till seven years' heat,
 :
 :Shall not behold her face at ample view,
 :But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,
 :And water once a day her chamber round
 :With eye-offending brine--all this to season
 :A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
 :And lasting in her sad remembrance.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
 :O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
 :
S:To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
 :
 :How will she love when the rich golden shaft
 :
 :Hath killed the flock of all affections else
 :
 :That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
 :These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled
 :Her sweet perfections with one self king!
 :Away before me to sweet beds of flowers!

S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  What country, friends, is this?
 :
 :CAPTAIN  This is Illyria, lady.
 :
 :VIOLA
S:
 :And what should I do in Illyria?
 :
 :My brother he is in Elysium.
 :
 :Perchance he is not drowned.--What think you,
 :
 :sailors?
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
 :
S:
 :VIOLA
 :
 :O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :True, madam. And to comfort you with chance,
 :Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
 :When you and those poor number saved with you
 :Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
S:
 :Most provident in peril, bind himself
 :
 :(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)
 :
 :To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,
 :
 :Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
 :I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
 :So long as I could see.
 :
 :VIOLA, [giving him money]  For saying so, there's gold.
S:
S:Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
 :
 :Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
 :
 :The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born
 :Not three hours' travel from this very place.
 :
S:VIOLA  Who governs here?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :
 :A noble duke, in nature as in name.
S:
 :
S:VIOLA  What is his name?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN  Orsino.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :Orsino. I have heard my father name him.
 :He was a bachelor then.
 :
 :CAPTAIN
S:
 :And so is now, or was so very late;
 :
 :For but a month ago I went from hence,
 :
 :And then 'twas fresh in murmur (as, you know,
 :
 :What great ones do the less will prattle of)
 :That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
 :
 :VIOLA  What's she?
 :
S:
 :CAPTAIN
 :
 :A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
 :
S:That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
 :
S:In the protection of his son, her brother,
 :
 :Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,
 :
 :They say, she hath abjured the sight
 :
S:And company of men.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  O, that I served that lady,
 :
 :And might not be delivered to the world
 :Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
 :What my estate is.
 :
 :CAPTAIN  That were hard to compass
 :Because she will admit no kind of suit,
S:
 :No, not the Duke's.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,
 :And though that nature with a beauteous wall
 :Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
 :I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
S:With this thy fair and outward character.
 :
 :I prithee--and I'll pay thee bounteously--
 :
 :Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
 :
 :For such disguise as haply shall become
 :The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke.
 :Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.
 :It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing
 :And speak to him in many sorts of music
 :That will allow me very worth his service.
S:
 :What else may hap, to time I will commit.
 :
 :Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAPTAIN
 :Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be.
S:When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I thank thee. Lead me on.

 :Scene 3
 :=======
 :[Enter Sir Toby and Maria.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :TOBY  What a plague means my niece to take the death
 :
 :of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to
 :
S:life.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier
 :
 :o' nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions
 :to your ill hours.
 :
S:TOBY  Why, let her except before excepted!
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Ay, but you must confine yourself within the
 :
 :modest limits of order.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than I am.
 :
 :These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so
 :
 :be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang
S:themselves in their own straps!
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I
 :
 :heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish
 :knight that you brought in one night here to be her
 :wooer.
 :
S:TOBY  Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Ay, he.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria.
 :
 :MARIA  What's that to th' purpose?
 :
 :TOBY  Why, he has three thousand ducats a year!
S:
S:
 :
 :MARIA  Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats.
 :
 :He's a very fool and a prodigal.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboy
 :s
 :and speaks three or four languages word
 :for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of
 :nature.
S:
 :
 :
 :MARIA  He hath indeed, almost natural, for, besides
 :
 :that he's a fool, he's a great quarreler, and, but that
 :
 :he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath
S:in quarreling, 'tis thought among the prudent he
 :
S:would quickly have the gift of a grave.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors
 :
 :that say so of him. Who are they?
 :
 :MARIA  They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in
 :your company.
 :
 :TOBY  With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to
S:
 :her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
 :
 :drink in Illyria. He's a coward and a coistrel that
 :
 :will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th'
 :
 :toe like a parish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo,
 :for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
 :
 :[Enter Sir Andrew.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?
 :
S:
 :
S:TOBY  Sweet Sir Andrew!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW, [to Maria]  Bless you, fair shrew.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  And you too, sir.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Accost, Sir Andrew, accost!
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  What's that?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  My niece's chambermaid.
 :
 :ANDREW  Good Mistress Accost, I desire better
S:acquaintance.
 :
 :
 :
S:MARIA  My name is Mary, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Good Mistress Mary Accost--
 :
 :
 :TOBY  You mistake, knight. "Accost" is front her, board
 :her, woo her, assail her.
 :
 :ANDREW  By my troth, I would not undertake her in
 :this company. Is that the meaning of "accost"?
S:
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Fare you well, gentlemen.	[She begins to exit.]
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou
 :
 :mightst never draw sword again.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  An you part so, mistress, I would I might
 :never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you
 :have fools in hand?
 :
 :MARIA  Sir, I have not you by th' hand.
 :
S:
 :ANDREW  Marry, but you shall have, and here's my
 :
 :hand.	[He offers his hand.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA, [taking his hand]  Now sir, thought is free. I
 :pray you, bring your hand to th' butt'ry bar and let
 :it drink.
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your
 :
 :metaphor?
 :
 :
 :MARIA  It's dry, sir.
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I
 :
 :can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
 :
 :
S:MARIA  A dry jest, sir.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Are you full of them?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends. Marry,
 :now I let go your hand, I am barren.	[Maria exits.]
 :
 :TOBY  O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary! When did
 :I see thee so put down?
 :
S:
 :ANDREW  Never in your life, I think, unless you see
 :
 :canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have
 :
S:no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man
 :
 :has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that
 :
 :does harm to my wit.
 :
 :
S:TOBY  No question.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride
 :
 :home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Pourquoi, my dear knight?
 :
 :ANDREW  What is "pourquoi"? Do, or not do? I would I
S:had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
 :
 :fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but
 :
 :followed the arts!
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
 :
 :ANDREW  Why, would that have mended my hair?
 :
S:TOBY  Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by
 :
 :nature.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  But it becomes me well enough, does 't not?
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Excellent! It hangs like flax on a distaff, and I
 :
 :hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs
 :
 :and spin it off.
 :
 :ANDREW  Faith, I'll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your
 :niece will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one
 :she'll none of me. The Count himself here hard by
S:woos her.
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  She'll none o' th' Count. She'll not match above
 :
 :her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have
 :
 :heard her swear 't. Tut, there's life in 't, man.
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th'
 :strangest mind i' th' world. I delight in masques
 :and revels sometimes altogether.
 :
 :TOBY  Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,
 :
 :under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not
 :
 :compare with an old man.
 :
S:TOBY  What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
 :
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Faith, I can cut a caper.
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  And I can cut the mutton to 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  And I think I have the back-trick simply as
 :
 :strong as any man in Illyria.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have
 :
 :these gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to
 :
 :take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost
S:thou not go to church in a galliard and come home
 :
 :in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would
 :
 :not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.
 :
 :What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues
 :in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
 :leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
 :
 :ANDREW  Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
 :dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some
S:
 :revels?
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  What shall we do else? Were we not born under
 :
S:Taurus?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Taurus? That's sides and heart.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee
 :caper. [Sir Andrew dances.] Ha, higher! Ha, ha,
 :excellent!

S:For this affair.--Some four or five attend him,

S:To call his fortunes thine.

S:

S:

S:
 :
 :FOOL  Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage,

 :and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.
 :
 :

 :
 :FOOL  Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
 :
 :MARIA  That if one break, the other will hold, or if both
S:
 :break, your gaskins fall.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir
 :
 :Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a

 :oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may

 :"Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit."--God bless

S:the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend
 :
S:himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he
 :
 :cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that's
 :
 :mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is
 :
S:but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but
 :
 :patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism
 :
 :will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is
 :
 :no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.
 :The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say
 :again, take her away.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Sir, I bade them take away you.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus
 :
 :non facit monachum. That's as much to say as, I
 :
 :wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give
 :
S:me leave to prove you a fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Can you do it?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Dexteriously, good madonna.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Make your proof.
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my
 :
 :mouse of virtue, answer me.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide
 :your proof.
 :
 :FOOL  Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?
 :
 :OLIVIA  Good Fool, for my brother's death.
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your
 :brother's soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool,
S:gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he
 :
 :not mend?
 :
S:MALVOLIO  Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death
 :
 :shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth
 :
 :ever make the better Fool.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
S:better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn
 :
 :that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for
 :
 :twopence that you are no fool.
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  How say you to that, Malvolio?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in
 :such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other
 :day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
S:
 :than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
 :
S:already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to
 :
 :him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men
 :
 :that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than
 :
 :the Fools' zanies.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
 :
 :with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless,
 :
 :and of free disposition is to take those things
 :for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There
 :is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do
S:nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
 :
 :man, though he do nothing but reprove.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
 :speak'st well of Fools!
 :
 :[Enter Maria.]
 :
 :
S:
 :MARIA  Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman
 :
 :much desires to speak with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  From the Count Orsino, is it?
 :
 :MARIA  I know not, madam. 'Tis a fair young man, and
 :well attended.
 :
S:
 :OLIVIA  Who of my people hold him in delay?
 :
S:
 :
 :MARIA  Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing
 :but madman. Fie on him! [Maria exits.] Go you,
 :Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick,
S:or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. [(Malvolio
 :
 :exits.)] Now you see, sir, how your fooling
 :
 :grows old, and people dislike it.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
 :
 :son should be a Fool, whose skull Jove cram with
 :
S:brains, for--here he comes--one of thy kin has a
 :
 :most weak pia mater.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Sir Toby.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  By mine honor, half drunk!--What is he at the
 :gate, cousin?
 :
S:
 :TOBY  A gentleman.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  A gentleman? What gentleman?
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  'Tis a gentleman here--a plague o' these pickle
 :
 :herring!--How now, sot?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Good Sir Toby.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by
 :this lethargy?
 :
S:
 :TOBY  Lechery? I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Ay, marry, what is he?
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give
 :
 :me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  What's a drunken man like, Fool?
 :
 :FOOL  Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. One
 :draught above heat makes him a fool, the second
 :mads him, and a third drowns him.
S:
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o'
 :
 :my coz, for he's in the third degree of drink: he's
 :
 :drowned. Go look after him.
 :
 :FOOL  He is but mad yet, madonna, and the Fool shall
 :look to the madman.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :[Enter Malvolio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Madam, yond young fellow swears he will
 :speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes
 :on him to understand so much, and therefore
 :comes to speak with you. I told him you were
S:asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that
 :
 :too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is
 :
 :to be said to him, lady? He's fortified against any
 :
 :denial.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Tell him he shall not speak with me.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Has been told so, and he says he'll stand at
 :your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter
S:
 :to a bench, but he'll speak with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  What kind o' man is he?
 :
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Why, of mankind.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  What manner of man?
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Of very ill manner. He'll speak with you,
 :
 :will you or no.
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Of what personage and years is he?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Not yet old enough for a man, nor young
 :enough for a boy--as a squash is before 'tis a
 :peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple. 'Tis
S:
 :with him in standing water, between boy and man.
 :
 :He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.
 :
 :One would think his mother's milk were
 :
 :scarce out of him.
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Maria.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Give me my veil. Come, throw it o'er my face.
S:[Olivia veils.]
 :
 :We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Viola.]
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
 :
S:OLIVIA  Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable
 :
 :beauty--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the
 :house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast
 :away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently
 :well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
 :beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible
 :even to the least sinister usage.
S:
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Whence came you, sir?
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  I can say little more than I have studied, and
 :
 :that question's out of my part. Good gentle one,
 :
 :give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the
 :
 :house, that I may proceed in my speech.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Are you a comedian?
S:
 :
S:VIOLA  No, my profound heart. And yet by the very
 :
S:fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are
 :
 :you the lady of the house?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
S:
 :
 :VIOLA  Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
 :
 :yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to
 :
 :reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on
S:with my speech in your praise and then show you
 :
 :the heart of my message.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Come to what is important in 't. I forgive you
 :the praise.
 :
 :VIOLA  Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis
 :poetical.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you,
 :
 :keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and
 :
 :allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than
 :to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have
 :reason, be brief. 'Tis not that time of moon with me
 :to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
 :
 :MARIA  Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little
 :
 :longer.--Some mollification for your giant, sweet
 :
 :lady.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Tell me your mind.
 :
 :VIOLA  I am a messenger.
S:
 :
 :
S:OLIVIA  Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver
 :
 :when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your
 :
 :office.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture
 :of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in
S:my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Yet you began rudely. What are you? What
 :
 :would you?
 :
 :VIOLA  The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
 :learned from my entertainment. What I am and
 :what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your
 :ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.
S:
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Give us the place alone. We will hear this
 :
 :divinity. [Maria and Attendants exit.] Now, sir, what
 :
 :is your text?
 :
 :VIOLA  Most sweet lady--
 :
 :OLIVIA  A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said
 :of it. Where lies your text?
S:
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  In Orsino's bosom.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more
 :
 :to say?
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Good madam, let me see your face.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Have you any commission from your lord to
 :
S:negotiate with my face? You are now out of your
 :
 :text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the
 :
 :picture. [She removes her veil.] Look you, sir, such a
 :
 :one I was this present. Is 't not well done?
 :
 :VIOLA  Excellently done, if God did all.
 :
S:OLIVIA  'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and
 :
 :weather.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
 :Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.
 :Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive
 :If you will lead these graces to the grave
 :And leave the world no copy.
S:
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give
 :
 :out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be
 :
 :inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled
 :to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item,
 :two gray eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one
S:chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise
 :
 :me?
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA
 :
S:I see you what you are. You are too proud.
 :
 :But if you were the devil you are fair.
 :
 :My lord and master loves you. O, such love
 :
 :Could be but recompensed though you were
 :crowned
 :The nonpareil of beauty.
 :
 :OLIVIA  How does he love me?
 :
S:
 :VIOLA  With adorations, fertile tears,
 :
 :With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.
 :Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
 :Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
 :In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,
S:
 :And in dimension and the shape of nature
 :
 :A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.
 :
 :He might have took his answer long ago.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :If I did love you in my master's flame,
S:With such a suff'ring, such a deadly life,
 :
 :In your denial I would find no sense.
 :
 :I would not understand it.
 :
 :
S:OLIVIA  Why, what would you?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
S:Make me a willow cabin at your gate
 :
 :And call upon my soul within the house,
 :
 :Write loyal cantons of contemned love
 :
 :And sing them loud even in the dead of night,
 :Hallow your name to the reverberate hills
 :And make the babbling gossip of the air
 :Cry out "Olivia!" O, you should not rest
S:Between the elements of air and earth
 :
 :But you should pity me.
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  You might do much.
 :
 :What is your parentage?
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
S:Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
 :
 :I am a gentleman.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Get you to your lord.
 :I cannot love him. Let him send no more--
 :Unless perchance you come to me again
 :To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.
S:I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.
 :
 :[She offers money.]
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA
 :
 :I am no fee'd post, lady. Keep your purse.
 :
 :My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
 :
S:Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,
 :
 :And let your fervor, like my master's, be
 :
 :Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  "What is your parentage?"
 :"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
S:I am a gentleman." I'll be sworn thou art.
 :
 :Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit
 :
 :Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,
 :
 :soft!
 :Unless the master were the man. How now?
 :Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
 :Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
 :With an invisible and subtle stealth
S:To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.--
 :
 :What ho, Malvolio!
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Malvolio.]

S:
 :

 :Run after that same peevish messenger,
 :The County's man. He left this ring behind him,
 :Would I or not. Tell him I'll none of it.
 :[She hands him a ring.]
S:
S:Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
 :
 :Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him.
 :
 :If that the youth will come this way tomorrow,
 :
 :I'll give him reasons for 't. Hie thee, Malvolio.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Madam, I will.	[He exits.]
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :I do I know not what, and fear to find
S:
 :Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
 :
 :Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe.

 :
 :[Enter Antonio and Sebastian.]
 :
 :
S:ANTONIO  Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that
 :
 :I go with you?
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly
S:over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps
 :
 :distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your
 :
 :leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad
 :
 :recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
 :
 :ANTONIO  Let me yet know of you whither you are
 :bound.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is
S:
 :mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent
 :
 :a touch of modesty that you will not extort
 :
 :from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it
 :
 :charges me in manners the rather to express myself.
 :You must know of me, then, Antonio, my name
 :is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was
 :that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have
 :heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister,
S:
 :both born in an hour. If the heavens had been
 :
 :pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir,
 :
 :altered that, for some hour before you took me
 :
 :from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
 :
 :ANTONIO  Alas the day!
 :
S:SEBASTIAN  A lady, sir, though it was said she much
 :
 :resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.
 :
 :But though I could not with such estimable
 :
 :wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
 :publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but
 :call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,
 :though I seem to drown her remembrance again
 :with more.
 :
S:
 :ANTONIO  Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO  If you will not murder me for my love, let me
 :
 :be your servant.
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  If you will not undo what you have done--
 :that is, kill him whom you have recovered--desire
 :it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of
 :kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my
 :mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine
S:
 :eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count
 :
 :Orsino's court. Farewell.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
 :I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
 :Else would I very shortly see thee there.
 :But come what may, I do adore thee so
S:
 :That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

 :
 :
 :
S:MALVOLIO  Were not you even now with the Countess
 :
 :Olivia?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since
 :arrived but hither.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  She returns this ring to you, sir. You might
 :have saved me my pains to have taken it away
 :yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put
S:
 :your lord into a desperate assurance she will none
 :
 :of him. And one thing more, that you be never so
 :
S:hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to
 :
 :report your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  She took the ring of me. I'll none of it.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and
 :her will is it should be so returned. [He throws
 :down the ring.] If it be worth stooping for, there it
 :lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.
S:

S:I left no ring with her. What means this lady?

 :[She picks up the ring.]
 :
 :Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!
 :
 :She made good view of me, indeed so much
 :That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
 :For she did speak in starts distractedly.
 :She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion
 :Invites me in this churlish messenger.
 :None of my lord's ring? Why, he sent her none!
S:
 :I am the man. If it be so, as 'tis,
 :
 :Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
 :
 :Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness
 :
S:Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
 :
 :How easy is it for the proper false
 :
 :In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
 :
 :Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,
 :For such as we are made of, such we be.
 :How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,
 :And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,
 :And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
 :What will become of this? As I am man,
S:
S:My state is desperate for my master's love.
 :
 :As I am woman (now, alas the day!),

 :What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

S:
 :[Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after
 :midnight is to be up betimes, and "diluculo surgere,"
 :thou know'st--
 :
 :ANDREW  Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to
S:
 :be up late is to be up late.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To
 :
 :be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early,
 :so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed
 :betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four
 :elements?
 :
S:
 :ANDREW  Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists
 :
S:of eating and drinking.
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Thou 'rt a scholar. Let us therefore eat and
 :
 :drink. Marian, I say, a stoup of wine!
 :
 :
S:[Enter Feste, the Fool.]
 :

 :ANDREW  Here comes the Fool, i' faith.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  How now, my hearts? Did you never see the
 :
 :picture of "We Three"?
 :
 :
S:TOBY  Welcome, ass! Now let's have a catch.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.
 :
 :I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
 :and so sweet a breath to sing, as the Fool has.--In
 :sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night
 :when thou spok'st of Pigrogromitus of the Vapians
 :passing the equinoctial of Queubus. 'Twas very
 :good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.
S:
 :Hadst it?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio's nose
 :
S:is no whipstock, my lady has a white hand, and the
 :
 :Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when
S:all is done. Now, a song!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [giving money to the Fool]  Come on, there is
 :
 :sixpence for you. Let's have a song.
S:
 :
 :ANDREW, [giving money to the Fool]  There's a testril of
 :
 :me, too. If one knight give a--
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Would you have a love song or a song of good
 :
 :life?
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  A love song, a love song.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Ay, ay, I care not for good life.
 :
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
 :O, stay and hear! Your truelove's coming,
 :That can sing both high and low.

 :
 :TOBY  A contagious breath.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
 :
 :TOBY  To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
 :But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall
 :we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw
 :three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?
S:
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  An you love me, let's do 't. I am dog at a
 :
 :catch.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  By 'r Lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
 :
 :ANDREW  Most certain. Let our catch be "Thou
 :Knave."
S:
 :
 :FOOL  "Hold thy peace, thou knave," knight? I shall be
 :
 :constrained in 't to call thee "knave," knight.
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  'Tis not the first time I have constrained one
 :to call me "knave." Begin, Fool. It begins "Hold
 :thy peace."
 :
 :FOOL  I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Good, i' faith. Come, begin.	[Catch sung.]
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Maria.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my
 :lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and
 :bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.
 :
 :TOBY  My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
S:
 :a Peg-a-Ramsey, and [Sings.] Three merry men be
 :
 :we. Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her
 :
 :blood? Tillyvally! "Lady"! [Sings.] There dwelt a man
 :
 :in Babylon, lady, lady.
 :
 :FOOL  Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
 :
 :ANDREW  Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,
S:
S:and so do I, too. He does it with a better grace, but
 :
 :I do it more natural.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY [sings]  O' the twelfth day of December--
 :
 :MARIA  For the love o' God, peace!
 :
 :[Enter Malvolio.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  My masters, are you mad? Or what are you?
 :
S:Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to
 :
 :gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you
 :
 :make an ale-house of my lady's house, that you
 :
 :squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation
S:or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of
 :
 :place, persons, nor time in you?
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady
S:bade me tell you that, though she harbors you as her
 :
 :kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
 :
S:you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,
 :
 :you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would
 :
 :please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to
 :
 :bid you farewell.
 :
 :TOBY [sings]
 :Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.
 :
 :MARIA  Nay, good Sir Toby.
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :
 :His eyes do show his days are almost done.
 :
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Is 't even so?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY [sings]
 :But I will never die.
 :
S:FOOL [sings]
 :
 :Sir Toby, there you lie.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  This is much credit to you.
S:
 :
 :TOBY [sings]
 :
 :Shall I bid him go?
 :
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
S:What an if you do?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY [sings]
 :
 :Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
 :
S:FOOL [sings]
 :
 :O no, no, no, no, you dare not.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Out o' tune, sir? You lie. Art any more than a
S:steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,
 :
 :there shall be no more cakes and ale?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' th'
S:mouth, too.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Thou 'rt i' th' right.--Go, sir, rub your chain
 :
 :with crumbs.--A stoup of wine, Maria!
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favor
 :at anything more than contempt, you would not give
 :means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by
 :this hand.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Go shake your ears!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a
 :man's a-hungry, to challenge him the field and
 :then to break promise with him and make a fool of
 :him.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Do 't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge. Or I'll
 :
 :deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the
 :youth of the Count's was today with my lady, she is
S:much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
 :
 :alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword
 :
 :and make him a common recreation, do not think I
 :
 :have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I
 :can do it.
 :
 :TOBY  Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
 :
 :MARIA  Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
S:
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason,
 :
 :dear knight?
 :
 :ANDREW  I have no exquisite reason for 't, but I have
 :reason good enough.
 :
 :MARIA  The devil a puritan that he is, or anything
S:
 :constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass
 :
 :that cons state without book and utters it by great
 :
 :swaths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed,
 :
 :as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds
 :of faith that all that look on him love him. And on
 :that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause
 :to work.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  What wilt thou do?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
 :love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of
 :his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his
 :eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself
 :most feelingly personated. I can write very like my
S:lady your niece; on a forgotten matter, we can
 :
 :hardly make distinction of our hands.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Excellent! I smell a device.
 :
 :ANDREW  I have 't in my nose, too.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
 :
 :that they come from my niece, and that she's in
 :
 :love with him.
 :
 :MARIA  My purpose is indeed a horse of that color.
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  And your horse now would make him an ass.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Ass, I doubt not.
 :
 :ANDREW  O, 'twill be admirable!
S:
 :
 :MARIA  Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic
 :
 :will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
 :
 :Fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.
 :Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed,
 :and dream on the event. Farewell.
 :
 :TOBY  Good night, Penthesilea.	[She exits.]
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Before me, she's a good wench.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores
 :me. What o' that?
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  I was adored once, too.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
 :more money.
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way
 :
 :out.
 :
 :
S:TOBY  Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i'
 :
S:th' end, call me "Cut."
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you
 :
 :will.
 :
S:TOBY  Come, come, I'll go burn some sack. 'Tis too
 :
 :late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight.
 :
 :[They exit.]

 :Scene 4
 :=======
 :[Enter Orsino, Viola, Curio, and others.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
S:Give me some music. [Music plays.] Now, good
 :
 :morrow, friends.--
 :
 :Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
 :
 :That old and antique song we heard last night.
S:Methought it did relieve my passion much,
 :
S:More than light airs and recollected terms
 :
 :Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.
 :
 :Come, but one verse.
 :
 :
 :CURIO  He is not here, so please your Lordship, that
 :should sing it.
 :
 :ORSINO  Who was it?
 :
S:
 :CURIO  Feste the jester, my lord, a Fool that the Lady
 :
 :Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about
 :
 :the house.
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Seek him out [Curio exits,] and play the tune the
 :while.	[Music plays.]
 :[To Viola.] Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
S:
S:In the sweet pangs of it remember me,
 :
 :For such as I am, all true lovers are,
 :
 :Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
 :
 :Save in the constant image of the creature
 :That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
 :
 :VIOLA
 :It gives a very echo to the seat
 :Where love is throned.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Thou dost speak masterly.
 :
 :My life upon 't, young though thou art, thine eye
 :
S:Hath stayed upon some favor that it loves.
 :
 :Hath it not, boy?
 :
S:
 :
 :VIOLA  A little, by your favor.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
S:What kind of woman is 't?
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  Of your complexion.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
 :She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
 :
 :VIOLA  About your years, my lord.
 :
S:ORSINO
 :
 :Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take
 :
 :An elder than herself. So wears she to him;
 :
S:So sways she level in her husband's heart.
 :
 :For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
 :
 :Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
 :
 :More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
 :Than women's are.
 :
 :VIOLA  I think it well, my lord.
 :
 :ORSINO
S:
 :Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
 :
 :Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.
 :
S:For women are as roses, whose fair flower,
 :
S:Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
 :
S:
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
S:And so they are. Alas, that they are so,
 :
 :To die even when they to perfection grow!
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Curio and Feste, the Fool.]
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.--
S:Mark it, Cesario. It is old and plain;
 :
 :The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
 :
 :And the free maids that weave their thread with
 :
 :bones
 :Do use to chant it. It is silly sooth,
 :And dallies with the innocence of love
 :Like the old age.
 :
 :FOOL  Are you ready, sir?
S:
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Ay, prithee, sing.	[Music.]
 :
 :The Song.
 :
 :
 :FOOL
 :Come away, come away, death,
 :And in sad cypress let me be laid.
 :Fly away, fly away, breath,
S:
 :I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
 :
 :My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
 :
S:O, prepare it!
 :
 :My part of death, no one so true
 :
 :Did share it.
 :
 :
 :Not a flower, not a flower sweet
 :On my black coffin let there be strown;
S:Not a friend, not a friend greet
 :
 :My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown.
 :
 :A thousand thousand sighs to save,
 :
 :Lay me, O, where
 :Sad true lover never find my grave
 :To weep there.
 :
 :ORSINO, [giving money]  There's for thy pains.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  I'll pay thy pleasure, then.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Truly sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or
 :
 :another.
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Give me now leave to leave thee.
 :
 :FOOL  Now the melancholy god protect thee and the
 :tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy
 :mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
S:
 :constancy put to sea, that their business might be
 :
 :everything and their intent everywhere, for that's it
 :
 :that always makes a good voyage of nothing.
 :
 :Farewell.	[He exits.]
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Let all the rest give place.
S:[All but Orsino and Viola exit.]
 :
 :Once more, Cesario,
 :
 :Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
 :
 :Tell her my love, more noble than the world,
 :Prizes not quantity of dirty lands.
 :The parts that Fortune hath bestowed upon her,
 :Tell her, I hold as giddily as Fortune.
 :But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
 :That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  But if she cannot love you, sir--
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :I cannot be so answered.
 :
 :VIOLA  Sooth, but you must.
S:Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
 :
S:Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
 :
 :As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;
 :
 :You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?
 :
S:
 :
 :ORSINO  There is no woman's sides
 :
 :Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
 :
S:As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
 :
S:So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.
 :
 :Alas, their love may be called appetite,
 :
S:No motion of the liver but the palate,
 :
 :That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
 :
 :But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
 :
 :And can digest as much. Make no compare
 :Between that love a woman can bear me
 :And that I owe Olivia.
 :
 :VIOLA  Ay, but I know--
 :
S:
 :ORSINO  What dost thou know?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :Too well what love women to men may owe.
 :In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
 :My father had a daughter loved a man
 :As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
 :I should your Lordship.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  And what's her history?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
 :But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,
 :Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,
 :And with a green and yellow melancholy
S:
 :She sat like Patience on a monument,
 :
S:Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
 :
 :We men may say more, swear more, but indeed
 :
 :Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
 :
 :Much in our vows but little in our love.
 :
 :ORSINO
 :But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
 :
 :VIOLA
S:
 :I am all the daughters of my father's house,
 :
S:And all the brothers, too--and yet I know not.
 :
 :Sir, shall I to this lady?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Ay, that's the theme.
 :To her in haste. Give her this jewel. Say
 :My love can give no place, bide no denay.
 :[He hands her a jewel and they exit.]

 :Scene 5
S:
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Nay, I'll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport,
 :
 :let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
 :
 :TOBY  Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
 :rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  I would exult, man. You know he brought me
 :
 :out o' favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  To anger him, we'll have the bear again, and we
 :will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir
 :Andrew?
 :
 :ANDREW  An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Maria.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Here comes the little villain.--How now, my
 :metal of India?
 :
 :MARIA  Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio's
S:
 :coming down this walk. He has been yonder i' the
 :
 :sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half
 :
 :hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I
 :
 :know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
 :him. Close, in the name of jesting! [They hide.] Lie
S:thou there [putting down the letter,] for here comes
 :
 :the trout that must be caught with tickling.
 :
 :[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter Malvolio.]
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  'Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once
 :told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself
S:
 :come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be
 :
 :one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a
 :
 :more exalted respect than anyone else that follows
 :
 :her. What should I think on 't?
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Here's an overweening rogue.
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare
S:
 :turkeycock of him. How he jets under his advanced
 :
 :plumes!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW, [aside]  'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Peace, I say.
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  To be Count Malvolio.
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Ah, rogue!
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  Pistol him, pistol him!
S:
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Peace, peace!
 :
 :
 :
S:MALVOLIO  There is example for 't. The lady of the
 :
 :Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  Fie on him, Jezebel!
S:
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, now he's deeply in. Look how
 :
 :imagination blows him.
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Having been three months married to her,
 :sitting in my state--
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
 :
S:
 :MALVOLIO  Calling my officers about me, in my
 :
 :branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed
 :
 :where I have left Olivia sleeping--
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Fire and brimstone!
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, peace!
 :
 :MALVOLIO  And then to have the humor of state; and
S:after a demure travel of regard, telling them I
 :
 :know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to
 :
 :ask for my kinsman Toby--
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Bolts and shackles!
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Seven of my people, with an obedient start,
S:
S:make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance
 :
 :wind up my watch, or play with my--some
 :
 :rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me--
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Shall this fellow live?
S:
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Though our silence be drawn from us
 :
 :with cars, yet peace!
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  I extend my hand to him thus, quenching
 :my familiar smile with an austere regard of
 :control--
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  And does not Toby take you a blow o' the
S:
 :lips then?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Saying, "Cousin Toby, my fortunes, having
 :
S:cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of
 :
 :speech--"
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  What, what?
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "You must amend your drunkenness."
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Out, scab!
S:
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Nay, patience, or we break the sinews
 :
S:of our plot!
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "Besides, you waste the treasure of your
 :
 :time with a foolish knight--"
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  That's me, I warrant you.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "One Sir Andrew."
 :
S:
 :ANDREW, [aside]  I knew 'twas I, for many do call me
 :
 :fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO, [seeing the letter]  What employment have
 :we here?
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Now is the woodcock near the gin.
 :
S:
 :TOBY, [aside]  O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate
 :
S:reading aloud to him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO, [taking up the letter]  By my life, this is my
 :
S:lady's hand! These be her very c's, her u's, and her
 :
 :t's, and thus she makes her great P's. It is in
 :
 :contempt of question her hand.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  Her c's, her u's, and her t's. Why that?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO [reads]  To the unknown beloved, this, and my
S:good wishes--Her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
 :
 :Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which
 :
S:she uses to seal--'tis my lady! [He opens the letter.]
 :
 :To whom should this be?
 :
 :
 :
S:FABIAN, [aside]  This wins him, liver and all.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO [reads]
 :
 :Jove knows I love,
 :But who?
 :Lips, do not move;
 :No man must know.
 :"No man must know." What follows? The numbers
 :altered. "No man must know." If this should be
S:
 :thee, Malvolio!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Marry, hang thee, brock!
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO [reads]
 :I may command where I adore,
 :But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
 :With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;
S:
S:M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  A fustian riddle!
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  Excellent wench, say I.
 :
S:MALVOLIO  "M.O.A.I. doth sway my life." Nay, but first
 :
 :let me see, let me see, let me see.
 :
S:
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  What dish o' poison has she dressed
 :
S:him!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  And with what wing the staniel checks
 :
S:at it!
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "I may command where I adore." Why, she
 :
 :may command me; I serve her; she is my lady. Why,
 :this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no
 :obstruction in this. And the end--what should that
 :alphabetical position portend? If I could make that
S:resemble something in me! Softly! "M.O.A.I."--
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [aside]  O, ay, make up that.--He is now at a cold
 :
 :scent.
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Sowter will cry upon 't for all this,
 :though it be as rank as a fox.
 :
S:MALVOLIO  "M"--Malvolio. "M"--why, that begins
 :
 :my name!
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Did not I say he would work it out? The
S:cur is excellent at faults.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "M." But then there is no consonancy in
 :
 :the sequel that suffers under probation. "A" should
 :follow, but "O" does.
 :
S:FABIAN, [aside]  And "O" shall end, I hope.
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY, [aside]  Ay, or I'll cudgel him and make him cry
 :
 :"O."
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  And then "I" comes behind.
S:
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside]  Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you
 :
 :might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes
 :
 :before you.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the
 :former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow
 :to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.
 :Soft, here follows prose.
S:

 :
 :Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and
 :
 :some have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy fates open
 :their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them.
 :And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast
 :thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with
S:a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang
 :
 :arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularit

 :
 :She thus advises thee that sighs for thee.
 :
 :Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and
 :wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember.
 :Go to, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so. If
 :not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of
 :servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers.
S:
 :Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,
 :
 :The Fortunate-Unhappy.
 :
 :Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is
 :
 :open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I
 :will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,
S:I will be point-devise the very man. I do not
 :
 :now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for
 :
 :every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.
 :
S:She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she
 :
 :did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this
 :
 :she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of
 :
 :injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I
S:thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout,
 :
 :in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with
 :
S:the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be
 :
S:praised! Here is yet a postscript.
 :
 :[He reads.] Thou canst not choose but know who I
 :
 :am. If thou entertain'st my love, let it appear in thy
 :
 :smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my
S:presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.
 :
S:Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything
 :
 :that thou wilt have me.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  I will not give my part of this sport for a
 :pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
 :
 :TOBY  I could marry this wench for this device.
 :
 :ANDREW  So could I too.
S:
 :
 :
 :TOBY  And ask no other dowry with her but such
 :
 :another jest.

S:

 :
 :when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
 :
 :
 :
S:MARIA  Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Like aqua vitae with a midwife.

S:MARIA  If you will then see the fruits of the sport,

 :
 :come to her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a color
 :
 :she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
S:and he will smile upon her, which will now
 :
 :be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted
 :
 :to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot
 :
S:but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Viola and Feste, the Fool, playing a tabor.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :VIOLA  Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live
 :
 :by thy tabor?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  No, sir, I live by the church.
 :
 :VIOLA  Art thou a churchman?
 :
 :FOOL  No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I
S:
 :do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the
 :
S:church.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a
 :
 :beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy
 :tabor if thy tabor stand by the church.
 :
 :FOOL  You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
 :but a chev'ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the
 :wrong side may be turned outward!
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Nay, that's certain. They that dally nicely with
 :
 :words may quickly make them wanton.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  I would therefore my sister had had no name,
 :sir.
 :
 :VIOLA  Why, man?
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with
 :
 :that word might make my sister wanton. But,
 :
S:indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced
 :
 :them.
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  Thy reason, man?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words,
 :
S:and words are grown so false I am loath to prove
 :
 :reason with them.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for
S:nothing.
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Not so, sir. I do care for something. But in my
 :
 :conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to
 :
S:care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you
 :
 :invisible.
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  Art not thou the Lady Olivia's Fool?
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  No, indeed, sir. The Lady Olivia has no folly. She
 :
 :will keep no Fool, sir, till she be married, and Fools
 :
 :are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings: the
 :husband's the bigger. I am indeed not her Fool but
 :her corrupter of words.
 :
 :VIOLA  I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the
 :
 :sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but
 :
 :the Fool should be as oft with your master as with
 :
S:my mistress. I think I saw your Wisdom there.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with
 :
 :thee. Hold, there's expenses for thee. [Giving a
 :coin.]
 :
 :FOOL  Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send
 :thee a beard!
 :
S:
 :VIOLA  By my troth I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
 :
 :one, [aside] though I would not have it grow on my
 :
 :chin.--Is thy lady within?
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Yes, being kept together and put to use.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to
 :
 :bring a Cressida to this Troilus.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I understand you, sir. 'Tis well begged. [Giving
 :another coin.]
 :
 :FOOL  The matter I hope is not great, sir, begging but a
 :beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir.
S:
 :I will conster to them whence you come. Who you
 :
 :are and what you would are out of my welkin--I
 :
 :might say "element," but the word is overworn.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :VIOLA
 :This fellow is wise enough to play the Fool,
 :And to do that well craves a kind of wit.
S:
 :He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
 :
 :The quality of persons, and the time,
 :
 :And, like the haggard, check at every feather
 :
S:That comes before his eye. This is a practice
 :
 :As full of labor as a wise man's art:
 :
 :For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
 :
 :But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
 :
 :[Enter Sir Toby and Andrew.]
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Save you, gentleman.
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  And you, sir.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur!
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.
 :
 :TOBY  Will you encounter the house? My niece is
S:desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
 :
 :list of my voyage.
 :
S:TOBY  Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
 :
S:understand what you mean by bidding me taste my
 :
 :legs.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
 :
 :VIOLA  I will answer you with gait and entrance--but
 :we are prevented.
 :
 :[Enter Olivia, and Maria, her Gentlewoman.]
S:
S:
 :
 :Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
 :
 :odors on you!
 :
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  That youth's a rare courtier. "Rain
 :odors," well.
 :
 :VIOLA  My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own
S:most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW, [aside]  "Odors," "pregnant," and "vouchsafed."
 :
 :I'll get 'em all three all ready.
 :
S:OLIVIA  Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to
 :
 :my hearing.	[Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria exit.]
 :
 :Give me your hand, sir.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :My duty, madam, and most humble service.
 :
S:OLIVIA  What is your name?
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :My servant, sir? 'Twas never merry world
S:Since lowly feigning was called compliment.
 :
S:You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.
 :Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,
 :
S:Would they were blanks rather than filled with me.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
 :On his behalf.
 :
 :OLIVIA  O, by your leave, I pray you.
S:I bade you never speak again of him.
 :
S:But would you undertake another suit,
 :
 :I had rather hear you to solicit that
 :
 :Than music from the spheres.
 :
 :
S:VIOLA  Dear lady--
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
 :
 :After the last enchantment you did here,
 :A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse
 :Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.
 :Under your hard construction must I sit,
 :To force that on you in a shameful cunning
 :Which you knew none of yours. What might you
S:
S:think?
 :
 :Have you not set mine honor at the stake
 :
S:And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
 :
 :That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your
 :
 :receiving
 :
 :Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,
 :Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
 :
 :VIOLA
 :I pity you.
 :
S:
 :OLIVIA  That's a degree to love.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof
 :That very oft we pity enemies.
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Why then methinks 'tis time to smile again.
S:
 :O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
 :
 :If one should be a prey, how much the better
 :
 :To fall before the lion than the wolf.	[Clock strikes.]
 :
 :The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
 :Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.
 :And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,
S:Your wife is like to reap a proper man.
 :
 :There lies your way, due west.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Then westward ho!
 :Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship.
 :You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
 :
S:OLIVIA
 :
 :Stay. I prithee, tell me what thou think'st of me.
 :
 :
 :
S:VIOLA
 :
 :That you do think you are not what you are.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :If I think so, I think the same of you.
 :
 :VIOLA
 :Then think you right. I am not what I am.
 :
S:
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :I would you were as I would have you be.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :Would it be better, madam, than I am?
 :I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA, [aside]
 :
 :O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
 :
 :In the contempt and anger of his lip!
 :A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
 :Than love that would seem hid. Love's night is
 :noon.--
 :Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
 :By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything,
S:
 :I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
 :
 :Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
 :
 :Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
 :
 :For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;
 :But rather reason thus with reason fetter:
 :Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.
 :
 :VIOLA
S:
 :By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
 :
 :I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
 :
 :And that no woman has, nor never none
 :
 :Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
 :And so adieu, good madam. Nevermore
 :Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
 :
S:OLIVIA
 :
 :Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move
 :
 :That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

 :Scene 2
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
 :
 :TOBY  Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
 :
 :FABIAN  You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the
 :
 :Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon
 :
 :me. I saw 't i' th' orchard.
 :
 :TOBY  Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me
 :that.
 :
S:
 :ANDREW  As plain as I see you now.
 :
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  This was a great argument of love in her toward
 :
 :you.
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
 :
 :FABIAN  I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
 :judgment and reason.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  And they have been grand-jurymen since before
 :
 :Noah was a sailor.
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  She did show favor to the youth in your sight
 :only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse
 :valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in
 :your liver. You should then have accosted her, and
 :with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,
S:
 :you should have banged the youth into dumbness.
 :
S:This was looked for at your hand, and this was
 :
 :balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let
 :
 :time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north
 :
 :of my lady's opinion, where you will hang like an
 :icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem
 :it by some laudable attempt either of valor or
S:policy.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  An 't be any way, it must be with valor, for
 :
 :policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a
 :politician.
 :
 :TOBY  Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis
 :of valor. Challenge me the Count's youth to fight
 :with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall
S:
 :take note of it, and assure thyself there is no
 :
 :love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
 :
 :commendation with woman than report of valor.
 :
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
 :
 :TOBY  Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and
S:brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent
 :
 :and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of
 :
 :ink. If thou "thou"-est him some thrice, it shall not
 :
 :be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
 :paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
 :bed of Ware in England, set 'em down. Go, about it.
S:Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
 :
 :write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Where shall I find you?
 :
 :TOBY  We'll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.
 :[Sir Andrew exits.]
 :
S:FABIAN  This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
 :
 :strong or so.
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  We shall have a rare letter from him. But you'll
 :
 :not deliver 't?
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on
 :the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
 :cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
 :opened and you find so much blood in his liver as
 :will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of th'
S:
 :anatomy.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage
 :
S:no great presage of cruelty.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Maria.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Look where the youngest wren of mine comes.
S:
 :
 :MARIA  If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves
 :
S:into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
 :
 :turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
 :
 :Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly
 :
 :can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.
S:He's in yellow stockings.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  And cross-gartered?
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Most villainously, like a pedant that keeps a
 :school i' th' church. I have dogged him like his
 :murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
 :that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face
 :into more lines than is in the new map with the
S:
 :augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such
 :
 :a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at
 :
 :him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he'll
 :
S:smile and take 't for a great favor.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Come, bring us, bring us where he is.

 :Set forth in your pursuit.

 :SEBASTIAN  My kind Antonio,
 :I can no other answer make but thanks,
 :And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns
S:

 :I do not without danger walk these streets.
 :Once in a sea fight 'gainst the Count his galleys
 :I did some service, of such note indeed
 :That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answered.
S:
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN
 :
 :Belike you slew great number of his people?
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :Th' offense is not of such a bloody nature,
 :Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
 :Might well have given us bloody argument.
S:
 :It might have since been answered in repaying
 :
 :What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,
 :
 :Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,
 :
S:For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
 :
 :I shall pay dear.
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  Do not then walk too open.
 :
 :ANTONIO
S:It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
 :
 :[Giving him money.]
 :
 :In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
 :
 :Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet
 :Whiles you beguile the time and feed your

 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  At your request? Yes, nightingales answer
 :daws!
 :
 :MARIA  Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness
 :before my lady?
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "Be not afraid of greatness." 'Twas well
 :
 :writ.
 :
 :
S:OLIVIA  What mean'st thou by that, Malvolio?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "Some are born great--"
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Ha?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "Some achieve greatness--"
 :
 :OLIVIA  What sayst thou?
S:
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "And some have greatness thrust upon
 :
 :them."
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Heaven restore thee!
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "Remember who commended thy yellow
S:stockings--"
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Thy yellow stockings?
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "And wished to see thee cross-gartered."
 :
 :OLIVIA  Cross-gartered?
 :
S:MALVOLIO  "Go to, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be
 :
 :so--"
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Am I made?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  "If not, let me see thee a servant still."
 :
 :OLIVIA  Why, this is very midsummer madness!
 :
 :[Enter Servant.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:SERVANT  Madam, the young gentleman of the Count
 :
 :Orsino's is returned. I could hardly entreat him
 :
 :back. He attends your Ladyship's pleasure.
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  I'll come to him. [Servant exits.] Good Maria, let
 :this fellow be looked to. Where's my Cousin Toby?
 :Let some of my people have a special care of him. I
 :would not have him miscarry for the half of my
 :dowry.
S:
 :[Olivia and Maria exit in different directions.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  O ho, do you come near me now? No worse
 :
 :man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs
 :directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose
S:that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites
 :
 :me to that in the letter: "Cast thy humble slough,"
 :
 :says she. "Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with
 :
 :servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of
 :state; put thyself into the trick of singularity," and
 :consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad
S:face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit
 :
 :of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her,
 :
 :but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful!
 :
 :And when she went away now, "Let this fellow be
 :looked to." "Fellow!" Not "Malvolio," nor after my
S:degree, but "fellow." Why, everything adheres together,
 :
 :that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a
 :
 :scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe
 :
 :circumstance--what can be said? Nothing that can
 :be can come between me and the full prospect of
 :my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and
 :he is to be thanked.
 :
 :[Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
 :
 :the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
 :
S:himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Here he is, here he is.--How is 't with you, sir?
 :
 :How is 't with you, man?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my
 :private. Go off.
 :
 :MARIA, [to Toby]  Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks
S:
 :within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady
 :
 :prays you to have a care of him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Aha, does she so?
 :
S:TOBY, [to Fabian and Maria]  Go to, go to! Peace, peace.
 :
 :We must deal gently with him. Let me alone.--How
 :
 :do you, Malvolio? How is 't with you? What, man,
 :
 :defy the devil! Consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Do you know what you say?
 :
 :MARIA, [to Toby]  La you, an you speak ill of the devil,
 :how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not
S:
 :bewitched!
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Carry his water to th' wisewoman.
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning
 :if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than
 :I'll say.
 :
S:
 :MALVOLIO  How now, mistress?
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  O Lord!
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do
 :
 :you not see you move him? Let me alone with
 :
 :him.
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The
 :
 :fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.
 :
 :
S:TOBY, [to Malvolio]  Why, how now, my bawcock? How
 :
 :dost thou, chuck?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Sir!
 :
 :TOBY  Ay, biddy, come with me.--What, man, 'tis not
 :for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang
 :him, foul collier!
 :
S:
 :MARIA  Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby; get
 :
 :him to pray.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  My prayers, minx?
 :
 :MARIA, [to Toby]  No, I warrant you, he will not hear of
 :godliness.
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Go hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow
 :
 :things. I am not of your element. You shall
 :
 :know more hereafter.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Is 't possible?
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  If this were played upon a stage now, I could
S:condemn it as an improbable fiction.
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  His very genius hath taken the infection of the
 :
 :device, man.
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air
 :and taint.
 :
 :FABIAN  Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
 :
S:
 :MARIA  The house will be the quieter.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Come, we'll have him in a dark room and
 :
 :bound. My niece is already in the belief that he's
 :mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his
 :penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath,
S:prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we
 :
 :will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
 :
 :finder of madmen. But see, but see!
 :
 :
 :[Enter Sir Andrew.]
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  More matter for a May morning.
 :
S:
 :ANDREW, [presenting a paper]  Here's the challenge.
 :
S:Read it. I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in 't.
 :
 :
 :
S:FABIAN  Is 't so saucy?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Ay, is 't. I warrant him. Do but read.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Give me. [He reads.] Youth, whatsoever thou art,
 :thou art but a scurvy fellow.
 :
 :FABIAN  Good, and valiant.
S:
 :
 :TOBY [reads]  Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind
 :
 :why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason
 :
 :for 't.
 :
 :FABIAN  A good note, that keeps you from the blow of
S:the law.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY [reads]  Thou com'st to the Lady Olivia, and in my
 :
 :sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat;
S:that is not the matter I challenge thee for.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
 :
 :
 :TOBY [reads]  I will waylay thee going home, where if it be
 :thy chance to kill me--
 :
 :FABIAN  Good.
 :
S:
 :TOBY [reads]  Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Still you keep o' th' windy side of the law.
 :
 :Good.
 :
S:TOBY [reads]  Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon
 :
 :one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but
 :
 :my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as
 :
S:thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
 :
 :Andrew Aguecheek.
 :
 :If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I'll
 :
S:give 't him.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  You may have very fit occasion for 't. He is now
 :
 :in some commerce with my lady and will by and
 :by depart.
 :
 :TOBY  Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner
 :of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever
 :thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw'st, swear
S:
 :horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,
 :
 :with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives
 :
S:manhood more approbation than ever proof itself
 :
S:would have earned him. Away!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  Nay, let me alone for swearing.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior
 :
 :of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
S:capacity and breeding; his employment between
 :
 :his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore,
 :
 :this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed
 :
 :no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a
S:clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
 :
 :word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable
 :
 :report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know
 :
 :his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous
 :opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This
 :will so fright them both that they will kill one
 :another by the look, like cockatrices.
 :
S:[Enter Olivia and Viola.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  Here he comes with your niece. Give them
 :way till he take leave, and presently after him.
 :
S:TOBY  I will meditate the while upon some horrid
 :
 :message for a challenge.
 :
 :[Toby, Fabian, and Maria exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :I have said too much unto a heart of stone
 :
S:And laid mine honor too unchary on 't.
 :
 :There's something in me that reproves my fault,
 :
 :But such a headstrong potent fault it is
 :
 :That it but mocks reproof.
 :
 :VIOLA
 :With the same 'havior that your passion bears
 :Goes on my master's griefs.
 :
S:
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :Here, wear this jewel for me. 'Tis my picture.
 :
 :Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.
 :
S:And I beseech you come again tomorrow.
 :
 :What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
 :
 :That honor, saved, may upon asking give?
 :
S:
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :How with mine honor may I give him that
 :Which I have given to you?
 :
 :VIOLA  I will acquit you.
S:
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.
 :
 :A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
S:[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Toby and Fabian.]
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Gentleman, God save thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  And you, sir.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  That defense thou hast, betake thee to 't. Of what
 :
 :nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
 :
 :not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
 :the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount
 :thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy
 :assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
 :
S:VIOLA  You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any
 :
 :quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and
 :
 :clear from any image of offense done to any man.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  You'll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore,
 :if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your
 :guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth,
 :strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
 :
S:
 :VIOLA  I pray you, sir, what is he?
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and
 :
 :on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private
 :brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and
 :his incensement at this moment is so implacable
 :that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
S:and sepulcher. "Hob, nob" is his word; "give 't or
 :
 :take 't."
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I will return again into the house and desire
 :some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have
 :heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely
 :on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a
 :man of that quirk.
S:
 :
 :TOBY  Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very
 :
 :competent injury. Therefore get you on and give
 :
 :him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,
S:unless you undertake that with me which with as
 :
 :much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,
 :
 :or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you
 :
 :must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about
 :you.
 :
 :VIOLA  This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do
 :me this courteous office, as to know of the knight
 :what my offense to him is. It is something of my
S:
S:negligence, nothing of my purpose.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  I will do so.--Signior Fabian, stay you by this
 :
 :gentleman till my return.	[Toby exits.]
 :
 :VIOLA  Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
 :
 :FABIAN  I know the knight is incensed against you even
 :to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance
S:
 :more.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
 :
S:
 :
 :FABIAN  Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read
 :
 :him by his form, as you are like to find him in the
 :
S:proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful,
 :
 :bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly
 :
 :have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
 :
 :towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
 :can.
 :
 :VIOLA  I shall be much bound to you for 't. I am one
 :that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I
 :care not who knows so much of my mettle.
S:
 :[They exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Toby and Andrew.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Why, man, he's a very devil. I have not seen such
 :
 :a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard,
 :and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such
 :a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the
 :answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the
 :ground they step on. They say he has been fencer
 :to the Sophy.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  Pox on 't! I'll not meddle with him.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can
 :scarce hold him yonder.
 :
 :ANDREW  Plague on 't! An I thought he had been
 :valiant, and so cunning in fence, I'd have seen him
S:
 :damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let
 :
 :the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, gray
 :
 :Capilet.
 :
 :
 :TOBY  I'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good
 :show on 't. This shall end without the perdition of
 :souls. [Aside.] Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I
 :ride you.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Fabian and Viola.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Toby crosses to meet them.]
 :[Aside to Fabian.] I have his horse to take up the
 :quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
 :
 :FABIAN, [aside to Toby]  He is as horribly conceited of
S:
 :him, and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his
 :
 :heels.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY, [to Viola]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
 :with you for 's oath sake. Marry, he hath better
 :bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
 :scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for
 :the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not
S:
 :hurt you.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  Pray God defend me! [Aside.] A little thing
 :
 :would make me tell them how much I lack of a
 :man.
 :
 :FABIAN  Give ground if you see him furious.
 :[Toby crosses to Andrew.]
S:
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy. The
 :
S:gentleman will, for his honor's sake, have one bout
 :
 :with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he
 :
 :has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,
 :
 :he will not hurt you. Come on, to 't.
 :
S:ANDREW, [drawing his sword]  Pray God he keep his
 :
 :oath!
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA, [drawing her sword]
S:I do assure you 'tis against my will.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Antonio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO, [to Andrew]
 :Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
 :Have done offense, I take the fault on me.
 :If you offend him, I for him defy you.
S:
 :
 :
S:TOBY  You, sir? Why, what are you?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO, [drawing his sword]
 :
 :One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
 :Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
 :
 :TOBY, [drawing his sword]
 :Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Officers.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN  O, good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.
 :
 :TOBY, [to Antonio]  I'll be with you anon.
 :
 :VIOLA, [to Andrew]  Pray, sir, put your sword up, if
S:
 :you please.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANDREW  Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised
 :
S:you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you
 :
 :easily, and reins well.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST OFFICER  This is the man. Do thy office.
 :
 :SECOND OFFICER  Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of
S:Count Orsino.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO  You do mistake me, sir.
 :
 :
S:FIRST OFFICER
 :
 :No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,
 :
 :Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.--
 :
 :Take him away. He knows I know him well.
 :
 :ANTONIO
S:I must obey. [To Viola.] This comes with seeking
 :
 :you.
 :
S:But there's no remedy. I shall answer it.
 :
 :What will you do, now my necessity
 :
S:Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
 :
 :Much more for what I cannot do for you
 :
 :Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,
 :
 :But be of comfort.
 :
 :SECOND OFFICER  Come, sir, away.
 :
 :ANTONIO, [to Viola]
 :I must entreat of you some of that money.
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA  What money, sir?
 :
 :For the fair kindness you have showed me here,
 :
 :And part being prompted by your present trouble,
 :Out of my lean and low ability
S:I'll lend you something. My having is not much.
 :
 :I'll make division of my present with you.
 :
 :Hold, there's half my coffer.	[Offering him money.]
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO  Will you deny me now?
 :
 :Is 't possible that my deserts to you
 :
 :Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
 :Lest that it make me so unsound a man
S:As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
 :
 :That I have done for you.
 :
S:
 :
 :VIOLA  I know of none,
 :
 :Nor know I you by voice or any feature.
 :
 :I hate ingratitude more in a man
 :Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,
 :Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
S:Inhabits our frail blood--
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO  O heavens themselves!
 :
 :
 :SECOND OFFICER  Come, sir, I pray you go.
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
 :Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
 :
 :I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,
 :Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
S:And to his image, which methought did promise
 :
 :Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST OFFICER
 :What's that to us? The time goes by. Away!
 :
S:ANTONIO
 :
 :But O, how vile an idol proves this god!
 :
 :Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
 :
 :In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
 :None can be called deformed but the unkind.
 :Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
 :Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.
 :
S:FIRST OFFICER
 :
 :The man grows mad. Away with him.--Come,
 :
 :come, sir.
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO  Lead me on.
 :[Antonio and Officers exit.]
 :
 :VIOLA, [aside]
 :Methinks his words do from such passion fly
S:
 :That he believes himself; so do not I.
 :
S:Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
 :
 :That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We'll
 :whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
 :[Toby, Fabian, and Andrew move aside.]
S:
 :
 :VIOLA, [aside]
 :
 :He named Sebastian. I my brother know
 :
 :Yet living in my glass. Even such and so
 :In favor was my brother, and he went
 :Still in this fashion, color, ornament,
 :For him I imitate. O, if it prove,
 :Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!
 :[She exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :TOBY  A very dishonest, paltry boy, and more a coward
 :
 :than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his
 :
 :friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
 :his cowardship, ask Fabian.
 :
 :FABIAN  A coward, a most devout coward, religious
S:in it.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy
 :
 :sword.
 :
 :ANDREW  An I do not--
S:
 :
S:FABIAN  Come, let's see the event.
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Sebastian and Feste, the Fool.]
 :
 :
S:
 :FOOL  Will you make me believe that I am not sent for
 :
S:you?
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let
 :
 :me be clear of thee.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Well held out, i' faith. No, I do not know you, nor
 :
 :I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come
 :
 :speak with her, nor your name is not Master
 :Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing
 :that is so is so.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.
 :Thou know'st not me.
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Vent my folly? He has heard that word of some
 :
 :great man and now applies it to a Fool. Vent my
 :
 :folly? I am afraid this great lubber the world will
 :prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness
 :and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I
S:vent to her that thou art coming?
 :
S:
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.
 :
 :There's money for thee. [Giving money.] If you
 :
 :tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise
 :
 :men that give Fools money get themselves a good
 :
 :report--after fourteen years' purchase.
 :
S:[Enter Andrew, Toby, and Fabian.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW, [to Sebastian]  Now, sir, have I met you again?
 :
 :There's for you.	[He strikes Sebastian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN, [returning the blow]  Why, there's for thee,
 :and there, and there.--Are all the people mad?
 :
 :TOBY  Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the
 :house.
 :
S:
 :FOOL, [aside]  This will I tell my lady straight. I would
 :
 :not be in some of your coats for twopence.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
S:TOBY, [seizing Sebastian]  Come on, sir, hold!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  Nay, let him alone. I'll go another way to
 :
S:work with him. I'll have an action of battery against
 :
 :him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck
 :
 :him first, yet it's no matter for that.
 :
S:
 :
 :SEBASTIAN, [to Toby]  Let go thy hand!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
 :soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed.
 :Come on.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN
 :I will be free from thee.
S:
 :[He pulls free and draws his sword.]

S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Maria and Feste, the Fool.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MARIA  Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
 :make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do
 :it quickly. I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.	[She exits.]
 :
 :FOOL  Well, I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in
S:
 :'t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled
 :
 :in such a gown. [He puts on gown and beard.] I am
 :
 :not tall enough to become the function well, nor
 :
 :lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be
 :said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as
 :fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar.
 :The competitors enter.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Toby and Maria.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  Jove bless thee, Master Parson.
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Bonos dies, Sir Toby; for, as the old hermit of
 :
 :Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said
 :
 :to a niece of King Gorboduc "That that is, is," so I,
 :
 :being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is
 :"that" but "that" and "is" but "is"?
 :
 :TOBY  To him, Sir Topas.
 :
S:FOOL, [disguising his voice]  What ho, I say! Peace in this
 :
 :prison!
 :
 :
 :
 :TOBY  The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.
S:
 :
 :[Malvolio within.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Who calls there?
 :
 :FOOL  Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
 :the lunatic.
 :
S:
 :MALVOLIO  Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to
 :
 :my lady--
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this
 :man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
 :
S:TOBY, [aside]  Well said, Master Parson.
 :
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged.
 :
 :Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have
 :
 :laid me here in hideous darkness--
 :
 :FOOL  Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
S:modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones
 :
 :that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayst
 :
 :thou that house is dark?
 :
 :
S:MALVOLIO  As hell, Sir Topas.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
 :
 :and the clerestories toward the south-north
 :are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest
 :thou of obstruction?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this
 :house is dark.
S:
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness
 :
 :but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than
 :
S:the Egyptians in their fog.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  I say this house is as dark as ignorance,
 :
 :though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say
 :there was never man thus abused. I am no more
S:mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any
 :
S:constant question.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning
 :
 :wildfowl?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  That the soul of our grandam might haply
S:inhabit a bird.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  What thinkst thou of his opinion?
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  I think nobly of the soul, and no way
 :approve his opinion.
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness.
 :
 :Thou shalt hold th' opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
 :
 :allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest
 :thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee
S:well.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
 :
 :
 :TOBY  My most exquisite Sir Topas!
 :
 :FOOL  Nay, I am for all waters.
 :
 :MARIA  Thou mightst have done this without thy beard
S:
 :and gown. He sees thee not.
 :
 :
 :
S:TOBY  To him in thine own voice, and bring me word
 :
 :how thou find'st him. I would we were well rid
 :
S:of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered,
 :
 :I would he were, for I am now so far in
 :
 :offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with
 :
 :any safety this sport the upshot. Come by and by
 :to my chamber.
 :[Toby and Maria exit.]
S:
 :
 :FOOL [sings, in his own voice]
 :
 :Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
 :
 :Tell me how thy lady does.
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Fool!
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :My lady is unkind, perdy.
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Fool!
 :
S:FOOL [sings]
 :
 :Alas, why is she so?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Fool, I say!
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :She loves another--
 :Who calls, ha?
 :
S:
 :MALVOLIO  Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at
 :
 :my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and
 :
 :paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful
 :
S:to thee for 't.
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Master Malvolio?
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Ay, good Fool.
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Fool, there was never man so notoriously
 :abused. I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.
 :
S:
 :FOOL  But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be
 :
S:no better in your wits than a Fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  They have here propertied me, keep me in
 :
 :darkness, send ministers to me--asses!--and do
 :all they can to face me out of my wits.
 :
S:FOOL  Advise you what you say. The minister is here.
 :
 :[In the voice of Sir Topas.] Malvolio, Malvolio, thy
 :
 :wits the heavens restore. Endeavor thyself to sleep
 :
 :and leave thy vain bibble-babble.
 :
S:MALVOLIO  Sir Topas!
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL, [as Sir Topas]  Maintain no words with him, good
 :
 :fellow. [As Fool.] Who, I, sir? Not I, sir! God buy
S:you, good Sir Topas. [As Sir Topas.] Marry, amen.
 :
 :[As Fool.] I will, sir, I will.
 :
 :
 :
S:MALVOLIO  Fool! Fool! Fool, I say!
 :
 :
 :
S:FOOL  Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am
 :
 :shent for speaking to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Good Fool, help me to some light and some
 :paper. I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any
 :man in Illyria.
 :
 :FOOL  Welladay that you were, sir!
 :
S:
 :MALVOLIO  By this hand, I am. Good Fool, some ink,
 :
S:paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to
 :
 :my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the
 :
S:bearing of letter did.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOOL  I will help you to 't. But tell me true, are you not
 :
 :mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit?
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.
 :
S:FOOL  Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
 :
S:brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
 :
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree. I
 :
 :prithee, begone.
 :
 :FOOL [sings]
 :I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,
 :I'll be with you again,
 :In a trice, like to the old Vice,
S:
 :Your need to sustain.
 :
 :Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,
 :
 :Cries "aha!" to the devil;
 :
 :Like a mad lad, "Pare thy nails, dad!
 :Adieu, goodman devil."

 :
 :This is the air; that is the glorious sun.
 :
 :This pearl she gave me, I do feel 't and see 't.
S:And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
 :
 :Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
 :
 :I could not find him at the Elephant.
 :
 :Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
 :That he did range the town to seek me out.
 :His counsel now might do me golden service.
 :For though my soul disputes well with my sense
 :That this may be some error, but no madness,
S:Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
 :
 :So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
 :
S:That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
 :
 :And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
 :
 :To any other trust but that I am mad--
 :

 :She could not sway her house, command her

 :Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
 :With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing

S:

 :OLIVIA, [to Sebastian]
 :Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,

 :Into the chantry by. There, before him

S:Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,

S:
 :FOOL  Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
 :
 :for my friends.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.
 :
 :FOOL  No, sir, the worse.
S:
 :
 :ORSINO  How can that be?
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me.
 :Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by
 :my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and
 :by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to
 :be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two
S:affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and
 :
 :the better for my foes.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Why, this is excellent.
 :
 :FOOL  By my troth, sir, no--though it please you to be
 :one of my friends.

 :ORSINO, [giving a coin]
S:
 :Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there's gold.

S:
 :and let your flesh and blood obey it.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a
 :
 :double-dealer: there's another.	[He gives a coin.]
 :
 :FOOL  Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old
 :saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a
S:good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet,
 :
 :sir, may put you in mind--one, two, three.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  You can fool no more money out of me at this
 :throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to
 :speak with her, and bring her along with you, it
 :may awake my bounty further.
 :
 :FOOL  Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
S:
 :again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think
 :
 :that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.
 :
 :But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap. I
 :
S:will awake it anon.	[He exits.]

 :
 :ORSINO
S:
 :That face of his I do remember well.
 :
 :Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared
 :
 :As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.
 :
 :A baubling vessel was he captain of,
 :For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,
 :With which such scatheful grapple did he make
 :With the most noble bottom of our fleet
 :That very envy and the tongue of loss
S:
 :Cried fame and honor on him.--What's the matter?
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST OFFICER
 :
 :Orsino, this is that Antonio
 :
 :That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,
 :And this is he that did the Tiger board
 :When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.
 :Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
 :In private brabble did we apprehend him.
 :
S:
 :VIOLA
 :
 :He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,
 :
 :But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
 :
S:I know not what 'twas but distraction.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
 :Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,
 :What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
 :Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
 :Hast made thine enemies?
 :
 :ANTONIO  Orsino, noble sir,
S:
 :Be pleased that I shake off these names you give
 :
 :me.
 :
 :Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
 :
 :Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,
 :Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.
S:That most ingrateful boy there by your side
 :
 :From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
 :
 :Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.
 :
 :His life I gave him and did thereto add
S:My love, without retention or restraint,
 :
 :All his in dedication. For his sake
 :
 :Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
 :
 :Into the danger of this adverse town;
 :Drew to defend him when he was beset;
 :Where, being apprehended, his false cunning
S:(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)
 :
 :Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
 :
 :And grew a twenty years' removed thing
 :
 :While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
 :Which I had recommended to his use
 :Not half an hour before.
S:
 :
 :VIOLA  How can this be?
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO, [to Antonio]  When came he to this town?
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
 :Today, my lord; and for three months before,
 :
 :No int'rim, not a minute's vacancy,
S:Both day and night did we keep company.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on
 :Earth!--
 :But for thee, fellow: fellow, thy words are madness.
S:

S:

 :OLIVIA
 :
 :What would my lord, but that he may not have,
 :

S:ORSINO  Gracious Olivia--
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA

 :What do you say, Cesario?--Good my lord--
 :
 :VIOLA
 :My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

S:OLIVIA

 :If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
 :
 :It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
 :
 :As howling after music.
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Still so cruel?
 :
 :OLIVIA  Still so constant, lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
 :What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady,
 :
S:To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
 :
 :My soul the faithful'st off'rings have breathed out
 :
 :That e'er devotion tendered--what shall I do?
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Even what it please my lord that shall become him.
S:
 :
 :ORSINO
 :
 :Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
 :
 :Like to th' Egyptian thief at point of death,
 :Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
 :That sometime savors nobly. But hear me this:
S:Since you to nonregardance cast my faith,
 :
 :And that I partly know the instrument
 :
 :That screws me from my true place in your favor,
 :
 :Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.
S:But this your minion, whom I know you love,
 :
 :And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
 :
 :Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
 :
 :Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.--
 :Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in
 :mischief.
 :I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love
 :To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
S:
 :
 :VIOLA

S:To do you rest a thousand deaths would die.

S:Where goes Cesario?
 :

 :More than I love these eyes, more than my life,

 :If I do feign, you witnesses above,
S:Punish my life for tainting of my love.

 :Reveals before 'tis ripe) what thou dost know
 :Hath newly passed between this youth and me.
 :
 :PRIEST
 :A contract of eternal bond of love,
S:
S:Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,
 :
 :Attested by the holy close of lips,

 :Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,

 :And all the ceremony of this compact
 :Sealed in my function, by my testimony;

 :grave
 :I have traveled but two hours.

S:
 :ORSINO, [to Viola]
 :
 :O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be
 :
 :When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?

 :Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
 :That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
 :Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet
S:Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.

S:My lord, I do protest--

S:ANDREW  For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one
 :
S:presently to Sir Toby.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  What's the matter?
 :
 :
S:ANDREW  Has broke my head across, and has given Sir
 :
 :Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,
 :
 :your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at
 :
 :home.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
 :
 :ANDREW  The Count's gentleman, one Cesario. We took

S:
 :incardinate.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  My gentleman Cesario?
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  'Od's lifelings, here he is!--You broke my
S:head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to

 :do 't by Sir Toby.
 :
S:
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.
 :
S:You drew your sword upon me without cause,
 :
 :But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDREW  If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt
S:me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

S:
 :

 :
 :ORSINO  How now, gentleman? How is 't with you?
S:
 :
 :TOBY  That's all one. Has hurt me, and there's th' end
 :
 :on 't. [To Fool.] Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
 :were set at eight i' th' morning.
S:

S:TOBY  Will you help?--an ass-head, and a coxcomb,
 :
 :and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull?
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
 :
 :[Toby, Andrew, Fool, and Fabian exit.]
 :
 :[Enter Sebastian.]
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN
S:
 :I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,
 :
S:But, had it been the brother of my blood,
 :
S:I must have done no less with wit and safety.
 :
 :You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
 :
 :I do perceive it hath offended you.
 :
 :Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
 :We made each other but so late ago.
 :
 :ORSINO
S:One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!
 :
 :A natural perspective, that is and is not!
 :
 :
 :
 :SEBASTIAN
 :Antonio, O, my dear Antonio!
 :How have the hours racked and tortured me
S:Since I have lost thee!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
S:Sebastian are you?
 :
S:
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
 :How have you made division of yourself?
 :
 :An apple cleft in two is not more twin
S:Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  Most wonderful!
 :
 :
S:SEBASTIAN, [looking at Viola]
 :
 :Do I stand there? I never had a brother,
 :
 :Nor can there be that deity in my nature
 :
 :Of here and everywhere. I had a sister
 :Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.
 :Of charity, what kin are you to me?
 :What countryman? What name? What parentage?
 :
 :VIOLA
S:
 :Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.
 :
S:Such a Sebastian was my brother too.
 :
 :So went he suited to his watery tomb.
 :
 :If spirits can assume both form and suit,
 :
 :You come to fright us.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN  A spirit I am indeed,
S:But am in that dimension grossly clad
 :
S:Which from the womb I did participate.
 :
 :Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
 :
 :I should my tears let fall upon your cheek
 :
 :And say "Thrice welcome, drowned Viola."
 :
 :VIOLA
 :My father had a mole upon his brow.
 :
S:SEBASTIAN  And so had mine.
 :
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :And died that day when Viola from her birth
 :Had numbered thirteen years.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN
S:O, that record is lively in my soul!
 :
 :He finished indeed his mortal act
 :
 :That day that made my sister thirteen years.
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :If nothing lets to make us happy both
 :But this my masculine usurped attire,
 :Do not embrace me till each circumstance
S:Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
 :
 :That I am Viola; which to confirm,
 :
 :I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
 :
S:Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
 :
 :I was preserved to serve this noble count.
 :
 :All the occurrence of my fortune since
 :
 :Hath been between this lady and this lord.
 :
 :SEBASTIAN, [to Olivia]
 :So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.
S:But nature to her bias drew in that.
 :
 :You would have been contracted to a maid.
 :
S:Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived:
 :
 :You are betrothed both to a maid and man.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO, [to Olivia]
 :Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
 :If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
 :I shall have share in this most happy wrack.--
 :Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
 :Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
S:
 :
 :
 :VIOLA
 :
 :And all those sayings will I overswear,
 :
S:And all those swearings keep as true in soul
 :
 :As doth that orbed continent the fire
 :
 :That severs day from night.
 :
 :
 :ORSINO  Give me thy hand,
 :And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
 :
 :VIOLA
S:The Captain that did bring me first on shore
 :
 :Hath my maid's garments. He, upon some action,
 :
 :Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit,
 :
 :A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :
 :He shall enlarge him.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Feste, the Fool with a letter, and Fabian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Fetch Malvolio hither.
 :
 :And yet, alas, now I remember me,
 :They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
 :A most extracting frenzy of mine own
 :From my remembrance clearly banished his.
 :[To the Fool.] How does he, sirrah?
 :
S:
 :FOOL  Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave's
 :
S:end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here
 :
 :writ a letter to you. I should have given 't you today
 :
 :morning. But as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
 :
 :so it skills not much when they are delivered.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Open 't and read it.
 :
 :FOOL  Look then to be well edified, when the Fool
 :delivers the madman. [He reads.] By the Lord,
S:
 :madam--
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA  How now, art thou mad?
 :
 :
 :FOOL  No, madam, I do but read madness. An your
 :Ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must
 :allow vox.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOOL  So I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to
 :read thus. Therefore, perpend, my princess, and
 :give ear.
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA, [giving letter to Fabian]  Read it you, sirrah.
 :
 :
 :
 :FABIAN [(reads)]  By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and
 :the world shall know it. Though you have put me into
 :darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
 :me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your
 :Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to
S:the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but
 :
 :to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of
 :
 :me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of
 :
 :and speak out of my injury.
 :The madly used Malvolio.
 :
 :OLIVIA  Did he write this?
S:
 :
 :FOOL  Ay, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
 :This savors not much of distraction.
 :
 :OLIVIA
S:See him delivered, Fabian. Bring him hither.
 :
 :[Fabian exits.]
 :
 :[To Orsino.] My lord, so please you, these things
 :
 :further thought on,
 :To think me as well a sister as a wife,
 :One day shall crown th' alliance on 't, so please
 :you,
 :Here at my house, and at my proper cost.
 :
S:
 :ORSINO
 :
 :Madam, I am most apt t' embrace your offer.
 :
 :[To Viola.] Your master quits you; and for your
 :
 :service done him,
 :So much against the mettle of your sex,
 :So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
 :And since you called me "master" for so long,
 :Here is my hand. You shall from this time be
S:
 :Your master's mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA, [to Viola]  A sister! You are she.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Malvolio and Fabian.]
 :
 :
 :ORSINO
S:
 :Is this the madman?
 :
S:
 :
 :OLIVIA  Ay, my lord, this same.--
 :
 :How now, Malvolio?
 :
 :
 :MALVOLIO  Madam, you have done me
 :wrong,
 :Notorious wrong.
 :
S:OLIVIA  Have I, Malvolio? No.
 :
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO, [handing her a paper]
 :
 :Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.
 :
 :You must not now deny it is your hand.
 :Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,
 :Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention.
 :You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
 :And tell me, in the modesty of honor,
 :Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?
S:
S:Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,
 :
 :To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
 :
 :Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?
 :
 :And, acting this in an obedient hope,
 :Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,
 :Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
S:And made the most notorious geck and gull
 :
 :That e'er invention played on? Tell me why.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
 :Though I confess much like the character.
 :But out of question, 'tis Maria's hand.
 :And now I do bethink me, it was she
 :First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
S:
 :And in such forms which here were presupposed
 :
 :Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.
 :
 :This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee.
 :
S:But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
 :
 :Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
 :
 :Of thine own cause.
 :
 :
S:FABIAN  Good madam, hear me speak,
 :
 :And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
 :
 :Taint the condition of this present hour,
 :
 :Which I have wondered at. In hope it shall not,
S:Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
 :
 :Set this device against Malvolio here,
 :
 :Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
 :
 :We had conceived against him. Maria writ
 :The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,
 :In recompense whereof he hath married her.
 :How with a sportful malice it was followed
 :May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
S:If that the injuries be justly weighed
 :
 :That have on both sides passed.
 :
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA, [to Malvolio]
 :Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
 :
S:FOOL  Why, "some are born great, some achieve greatness,
 :
 :and some have greatness thrown upon them."
 :
S:I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir,
 :
 :but that's all one. "By the Lord, Fool, I am not
 :
 :mad"--but, do you remember "Madam, why laugh
 :
 :you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he's
S:gagged"? And thus the whirligig of time brings in
 :
 :his revenges.
 :
S:
 :
 :MALVOLIO
 :
 :I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you!	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :OLIVIA
 :He hath been most notoriously abused.
 :
 :ORSINO
 :Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.	[Some exit.]
S:
 :He hath not told us of the Captain yet.
 :
 :When that is known, and golden time convents,
 :
 :A solemn combination shall be made
 :
S:Of our dear souls.--Meantime, sweet sister,
 :
 :We will not part from hence.--Cesario, come,
 :
S:For so you shall be while you are a man.
 :
S:But when in other habits you are seen,
 :
 :Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen.
 :
 :[All but the Fool exit.]
 :
 :
S:FOOL [sings]
 :
 :When that I was and a little tiny boy,
 :
 :With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
 :
 :A foolish thing was but a toy,
 :For the rain it raineth every day.
S:
 :
 :But when I came to man's estate,
 :
 :With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
 :
S:'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
 :
 :For the rain it raineth every day.
 :
 :
 :
 :But when I came, alas, to wive,
 :With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
 :By swaggering could I never thrive,
S:For the rain it raineth every day.
 :
 :
 :
 :But when I came unto my beds,
 :
 :With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
 :With tosspots still had drunken heads,
 :For the rain it raineth every day.
 :
 :A great while ago the world begun,
 :With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
S:
S:But that's all one, our play is done,
 :
 :And we'll strive to please you every day.
 :
 :[He exits.]
