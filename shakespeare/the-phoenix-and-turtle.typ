 :"The Phoenix and Turtle"
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :Let the bird of loudest lay
 :On the sole Arabian tree
 :Herald sad and trumpet be,
 :To whose sound chaste wings obey.
S:
 :
 :
 :But thou shrieking harbinger,
 :
 :Foul precurrer of the fiend,
 :
 :Augur of the fever's end,
S:To this troop come thou not near.
 :
 :
 :
 :From this session interdict
 :
 :Every fowl of tyrant wing,
S:Save the eagle, feathered king;
 :
 :Keep the obsequy so strict.
 :
 :
 :
 :Let the priest in surplice white,
 :That defunctive music can,
 :Be the death-divining swan,
 :Lest the requiem lack his right.
 :
 :And thou treble-dated crow,
S:
 :That thy sable gender mak'st
 :
 :With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
 :
 :'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.
 :
 :
 :Here the anthem doth commence:
 :Love and constancy is dead,
 :Phoenix and the turtle fled
 :In a mutual flame from hence.
S:
 :
 :
S:So they loved, as love in twain
 :
 :Had the essence but in one,
 :
 :Two distincts, division none;
 :
 :Number there in love was slain.
 :
 :Hearts remote yet not asunder,
 :Distance and no space was seen
 :'Twixt this turtle and his queen;
 :But in them it were a wonder.
S:
 :
 :
 :So between them love did shine
 :
 :That the turtle saw his right
 :
S:Flaming in the phoenix' sight;
 :
S:Either was the other's mine.
 :
S:
 :
 :Property was thus appalled
 :
 :That the self was not the same;
 :
 :Single nature's double name
 :Neither two nor one was called.
 :
 :Reason, in itself confounded,
 :Saw division grow together,
 :To themselves yet either neither,
S:
 :Simple were so well compounded
 :
 :
 :
 :That it cried, "How true a twain
 :
 :Seemeth this concordant one!
 :Love hath reason, Reason none,
 :If what parts can so remain,"
 :
 :Whereupon it made this threne
S:
 :To the phoenix and the dove,
 :
 :Co-supremes and stars of love,
 :
 :As chorus to their tragic scene.
 :
 :
 :
 :Threnos
 :
 :
S:
 :Beauty, truth, and rarity,
 :
 :Grace in all simplicity,
 :
 :Here enclosed, in cinders lie.
 :
S:
 :
 :Death is now the phoenix' nest,
 :
 :And the turtle's loyal breast
 :
 :To eternity doth rest,
 :
 :Leaving no posterity;
S:'Twas not their infirmity,
 :
 :It was married chastity.
 :
 :
 :
 :Truth may seem, but cannot be;
 :Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
 :Truth and beauty buried be.
S:
 :
 :To this urn let those repair
 :
 :That are either true or fair;
 :
 :For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
 :
 :William Shakespeare
