 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners,
 :
 :including a Carpenter and a Cobbler, over the stage.]
 :
 :
 :FLAVIUS
 :Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!
S:
 :Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
 :
 :Being mechanical, you ought not walk
 :
 :Upon a laboring day without the sign
 :
 :Of your profession?--Speak, what trade art thou?
 :
 :CARPENTER  Why, sir, a carpenter.
 :
 :MARULLUS
S:
 :Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
 :
 :What dost thou with thy best apparel on?--
 :
 :You, sir, what trade are you?
 :
 :
 :COBBLER  Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
S:but, as you would say, a cobbler.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARULLUS
 :
 :But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
 :
 :COBBLER  A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe
 :conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad
 :soles.
 :
S:
 :FLAVIUS
 :
 :What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what
 :
 :trade?
 :
 :
 :COBBLER  Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.
S:Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
 :
 :
 :
 :MARULLUS
 :
 :What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy
 :fellow?
 :
 :COBBLER  Why, sir, cobble you.
 :
 :FLAVIUS  Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
S:
 :
 :
 :COBBLER  Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the
 :
 :awl. I meddle with no tradesman's matters nor
 :
 :women's matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a
 :surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger,
 :I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
 :neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
 :
S:
 :FLAVIUS
 :
 :But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
 :
 :Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
 :
 :
 :COBBLER  Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to
 :get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we
 :make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his
 :triumph.
S:
 :
 :
S:MARULLUS
 :
 :Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
 :
 :What tributaries follow him to Rome
 :
 :To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
 :You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless
 :things!
 :O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
S:Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
 :
 :Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
 :
 :To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
 :
 :Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
 :The livelong day, with patient expectation,
 :To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
 :And when you saw his chariot but appear,
 :Have you not made an universal shout,
 :That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
S:
 :To hear the replication of your sounds
 :
 :Made in her concave shores?
 :
 :And do you now put on your best attire?
 :
S:And do you now cull out a holiday?
 :
 :And do you now strew flowers in his way
 :
 :That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
 :
 :Be gone!
 :Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
 :Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
S:That needs must light on this ingratitude.
 :
 :
 :
 :FLAVIUS
 :
 :Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault
 :Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
 :Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
 :Into the channel, till the lowest stream
 :Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
 :[All the Commoners exit.]
S:
 :See whe'er their basest mettle be not moved.
 :
 :They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
 :
 :Go you down that way towards the Capitol.
 :
 :This way will I. Disrobe the images
 :If you do find them decked with ceremonies.
 :
S:MARULLUS  May we do so?
 :
 :You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
 :
S:
 :
 :FLAVIUS
 :
 :It is no matter. Let no images
 :
 :Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about
 :And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
 :So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
S:These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing
 :
 :Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
 :
 :Who else would soar above the view of men
 :
 :And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
 :[They exit in different directions.]

S:Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia,
 :
 :Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer;
 :after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Calphurnia.
 :
 :CASCA  Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
 :
 :CAESAR  Calphurnia.
 :
S:
 :CALPHURNIA  Here, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Stand you directly in Antonius' way
 :When he doth run his course.--Antonius.
 :
 :ANTONY  Caesar, my lord.
 :
S:
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Forget not in your speed, Antonius,
 :
 :To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say
 :
 :The barren, touched in this holy chase,
 :Shake off their sterile curse.
 :
S:ANTONY  I shall remember.
 :
 :When Caesar says "Do this," it is performed.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :Set on and leave no ceremony out.	[Sennet.]
 :
S:SOOTHSAYER  Caesar.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Ha! Who calls?
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again!
 :
 :CAESAR
 :Who is it in the press that calls on me?
S:
 :I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
 :
 :Cry "Caesar." Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.
 :
 :
 :
S:SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :Beware the ides of March.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  What man is that?
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
 :
 :CAESAR
S:
 :Set him before me. Let me see his face.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Fellow, come from the throng.
 :[The Soothsayer comes forward.]
 :Look upon Caesar.
 :
 :CAESAR
S:
 :What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER  Beware the ides of March.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.
 :[Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit.]
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Will you go see the order of the course?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Not I.
 :
 :CASSIUS  I pray you, do.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :I am not gamesome. I do lack some part
 :
 :Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
 :
 :Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
 :
 :I'll leave you.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Brutus, I do observe you now of late.
 :I have not from your eyes that gentleness
S:
 :And show of love as I was wont to have.
 :
S:You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
 :
 :Over your friend that loves you.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS  Cassius,
 :
 :Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,
 :
 :I turn the trouble of my countenance
 :
 :Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
 :Of late with passions of some difference,
 :Conceptions only proper to myself,
S:Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.
 :
 :But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
 :
 :(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)
 :
 :Nor construe any further my neglect
 :Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
 :Forgets the shows of love to other men.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
S:
S:By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
 :
 :Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
 :
 :Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
 :But by reflection, by some other things.
 :
 :CASSIUS  'Tis just.
S:
 :And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
 :
 :That you have no such mirrors as will turn
 :
 :Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
 :
 :That you might see your shadow. I have heard
 :Where many of the best respect in Rome,
 :Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
 :And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
 :Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
 :
 :That you would have me seek into myself
 :For that which is not in me?
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.
S:
 :And since you know you cannot see yourself
 :
 :So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
 :
S:Will modestly discover to yourself
 :
 :That of yourself which you yet know not of.
 :
 :And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.
 :
 :Were I a common laughter, or did use
 :To stale with ordinary oaths my love
 :To every new protester; if you know
 :That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
 :And after scandal them, or if you know
 :That I profess myself in banqueting
S:
 :To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
 :
 :[Flourish and shout.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :What means this shouting? I do fear the people
 :Choose Caesar for their king.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Ay, do you fear it?
S:
 :Then must I think you would not have it so.
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
 :
 :But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
 :What is it that you would impart to me?
 :If it be aught toward the general good,
 :Set honor in one eye and death i' th' other
S:And I will look on both indifferently;
 :
 :For let the gods so speed me as I love
 :
S:The name of honor more than I fear death.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
 :As well as I do know your outward favor.
 :Well, honor is the subject of my story.
 :I cannot tell what you and other men
 :Think of this life; but, for my single self,
S:I had as lief not be as live to be
 :
 :In awe of such a thing as I myself.
 :
 :I was born free as Caesar; so were you;
 :
 :We both have fed as well, and we can both
 :Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
 :For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
 :The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
 :Caesar said to me "Dar'st thou, Cassius, now
 :Leap in with me into this angry flood
S:
 :And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
 :
S:Accoutered as I was, I plunged in
 :
 :And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
 :
 :The torrent roared, and we did buffet it
 :
 :With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
 :And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
 :But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
 :Caesar cried "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"
 :I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
S:Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
 :
 :The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
 :
 :Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
 :
 :Is now become a god, and Cassius is
 :A wretched creature and must bend his body
 :If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
S:He had a fever when he was in Spain,
 :
 :And when the fit was on him, I did mark
 :
 :How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake.
 :
 :His coward lips did from their color fly,
 :And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
 :Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
S:Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
 :
 :Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
 :
 :"Alas," it cried "Give me some drink, Titinius"
 :
 :As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me
 :A man of such a feeble temper should
S:So get the start of the majestic world
 :
 :And bear the palm alone.
 :
 :[Shout. Flourish.]
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Another general shout!
 :I do believe that these applauses are
 :For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
 :
 :Like a Colossus, and we petty men
 :Walk under his huge legs and peep about
 :To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
 :Men at some time are masters of their fates.
 :The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
S:But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
 :
 :"Brutus" and "Caesar"--what should be in that
 :
 :"Caesar"?
 :
 :Why should that name be sounded more than
 :yours?
 :Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
 :Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
 :Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
 :"Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
S:
 :Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
 :
 :Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
 :
 :That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
 :
 :Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
 :When went there by an age, since the great flood,
 :But it was famed with more than with one man?
 :When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,
 :That her wide walks encompassed but one man?
S:
 :Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough
 :
 :When there is in it but one only man.
 :
 :O, you and I have heard our fathers say
 :
 :There was a Brutus once that would have brooked
 :Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
 :As easily as a king.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
 :
 :What you would work me to, I have some aim.
 :
 :How I have thought of this, and of these times,
 :
 :I shall recount hereafter. For this present,
 :I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
 :Be any further moved. What you have said
 :I will consider; what you have to say
S:I will with patience hear, and find a time
 :
 :Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
 :
 :Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
 :
 :Brutus had rather be a villager
 :Than to repute himself a son of Rome
 :Under these hard conditions as this time
 :Is like to lay upon us.
 :
 :CASSIUS  I am glad that my weak words
S:
 :Have struck but thus much show of fire from
 :
 :Brutus.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Caesar and his train.]
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
S:
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
 :
S:And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
 :
 :What hath proceeded worthy note today.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :I will do so. But look you, Cassius,
 :The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
 :And all the rest look like a chidden train.
 :Calphurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
 :Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
S:
 :As we have seen him in the Capitol,
 :
 :Being crossed in conference by some senators.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Casca will tell us what the matter is.
 :
 :CAESAR  Antonius.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY  Caesar.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Let me have men about me that are fat,
 :Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.
 :Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
 :He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous.
 :
 :He is a noble Roman, and well given.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.
 :
 :Yet if my name were liable to fear,
 :I do not know the man I should avoid
 :So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
 :He is a great observer, and he looks
 :Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
 :As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
S:
 :Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
 :
S:As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit
 :
 :That could be moved to smile at anything.
 :
 :Such men as he be never at heart's ease
 :
 :Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
 :And therefore are they very dangerous.
S:I rather tell thee what is to be feared
 :
 :Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
 :
 :Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
 :
 :And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
 :[Sennet. Caesar and his train exit
 :but Casca remains behind.]
 :
 :CASCA  You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak
 :with me?
S:
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today
 :
 :That Caesar looks so sad.
S:
 :
 :CASCA  Why, you were with him, were you not?
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being
 :offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
 :thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.
 :
 :BRUTUS  What was the second noise for?
S:
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Why, for that too.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
 :
 :CASCA  Why, for that too.
 :
S:
 :BRUTUS  Was the crown offered him thrice?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Ay, marry, was 't, and he put it by thrice, every
 :
 :time gentler than other; and at every putting-by,
 :mine honest neighbors shouted.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Who offered him the crown?
 :
S:
S:CASCA  Why, Antony.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
S:
 :
 :CASCA  I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
 :
 :It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
 :
 :Antony offer him a crown (yet 'twas not a crown
 :neither; 'twas one of these coronets), and, as I told
S:you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my
 :
 :thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered
 :
S:it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my
 :
 :thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
 :
 :And then he offered it the third time. He put it the
 :
 :third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement
 :hooted and clapped their chopped hands and
 :threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a
 :deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the
 :crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he
 :swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,
S:
 :I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and
 :
 :receiving the bad air.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
S:
 :
 :CASCA  He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at
 :
 :mouth and was speechless.
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :'Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I
S:
 :And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  I know not what you mean by that, but I am
 :
S:sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
 :
 :clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
 :
 :displeased them, as they use to do the players in the
 :
 :theater, I am no true man.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :What said he when he came unto himself?
 :
 :CASCA  Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived
S:
 :the common herd was glad he refused the crown,
 :
 :he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
 :
 :throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,
 :
 :if I would not have taken him at a word, I
S:would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
 :
 :he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he
 :
 :had done or said anything amiss, he desired their
 :
 :Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four
 :wenches where I stood cried "Alas, good soul!" and
S:forgave him with all their hearts. But there's no
 :
 :heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed
 :
 :their mothers, they would have done no less.
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :And, after that, he came thus sad away?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Ay.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Did Cicero say anything?
S:
 :
 :CASCA  Ay, he spoke Greek.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  To what effect?
 :
 :CASCA  Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' th'
 :face again. But those that understood him smiled at
 :one another and shook their heads. But for mine
 :own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
S:
 :news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves
 :
 :off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
 :
 :well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember
 :
 :it.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
 :
 :CASCA  No, I am promised forth.
S:
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS  Will you dine with me tomorrow?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your
 :
 :dinner worth the eating.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Good. I will expect you.
 :
 :CASCA  Do so. Farewell both.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
 :
 :He was quick mettle when he went to school.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :So is he now in execution
 :Of any bold or noble enterprise,
 :However he puts on this tardy form.
S:
 :This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
 :
 :Which gives men stomach to digest his words
 :
 :With better appetite.
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
 :Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
 :I will come home to you; or, if you will,
S:
 :Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
 :[Brutus exits.]
S:Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see
 :
 :Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
 :
S:From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet
 :
 :That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
 :
 :For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
 :
 :Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
 :If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,
 :He should not humor me. I will this night
 :In several hands in at his windows throw,
S:As if they came from several citizens,
 :
 :Writings, all tending to the great opinion
 :
 :That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
 :
 :Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
 :And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,
 :For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

 :Scene 3
S:
 :=======
 :
 :[Thunder and lightning. Enter Casca and Cicero.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CICERO
S:Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
 :
 :Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
 :Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
 :I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
 :Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
 :Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
S:
 :To be exalted with the threat'ning clouds;
 :
 :But never till tonight, never till now,
 :
 :Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
 :
 :Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
 :Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
 :Incenses them to send destruction.
 :
 :CICERO
S:
S:Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :
 :A common slave (you know him well by sight)
S:Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
 :
 :Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,
 :
 :Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.
 :
 :Besides (I ha' not since put up my sword),
S:Against the Capitol I met a lion,
 :
 :Who glazed upon me and went surly by
 :
 :Without annoying me. And there were drawn
 :
 :Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
 :Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
 :Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
S:And yesterday the bird of night did sit
 :
 :Even at noonday upon the marketplace,
 :
 :Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
 :
 :Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
 :"These are their reasons, they are natural,"
 :For I believe they are portentous things
 :Unto the climate that they point upon.
 :
 :CICERO
S:
 :Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
 :
 :But men may construe things after their fashion,
 :
 :Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
 :
 :Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
 :
S:CASCA
 :
 :He doth, for he did bid Antonius
 :
 :Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :CICERO
 :Good night then, Casca. This disturbed sky
 :Is not to walk in.
 :
S:CASCA  Farewell, Cicero	[Cicero exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cassius.]
 :
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
S:Who's there?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  A Roman.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Casca, by your voice.
S:
 :
 :CASCA
 :
 :Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:A very pleasing night to honest men.
 :
 :
 :
S:CASCA
 :
 :Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Those that have known the Earth so full of faults.
 :
 :For my part, I have walked about the streets,
 :Submitting me unto the perilous night,
 :And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
S:Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
 :
 :And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open
 :
 :The breast of heaven, I did present myself
 :
 :Even in the aim and very flash of it.
 :
 :CASCA
S:But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
 :
 :It is the part of men to fear and tremble
 :
 :When the most mighty gods by tokens send
 :
 :Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
 :
 :That should be in a Roman you do want,
 :Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,
 :And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,
 :To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
 :But if you would consider the true cause
 :Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
S:
 :Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
 :
 :Why old men, fools, and children calculate,
 :
 :Why all these things change from their ordinance,
 :
 :Their natures, and preformed faculties,
 :To monstrous quality--why, you shall find
 :That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
 :To make them instruments of fear and warning
 :Unto some monstrous state.
S:
 :Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
 :
 :Most like this dreadful night,
 :
 :That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
 :
S:As doth the lion in the Capitol;
 :
 :A man no mightier than thyself or me
 :
 :In personal action, yet prodigious grown,
 :
 :And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
 :
 :CASCA
S:'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Let it be who it is. For Romans now
 :Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
 :But, woe the while, our fathers' minds are dead,
S:And we are governed with our mothers' spirits.
 :
 :Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow
 :Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
S:And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
 :
 :In every place save here in Italy.
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :I know where I will wear this dagger then;
 :
S:Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
 :
 :Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;
 :
 :Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.
 :
 :Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
 :Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
 :Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
 :But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
 :Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
 :If I know this, know all the world besides,
S:
 :That part of tyranny that I do bear
 :
 :I can shake off at pleasure.	[Thunder still.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  So can I.
S:So every bondman in his own hand bears
 :
 :The power to cancel his captivity.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?
 :
 :Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf
 :
 :But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;
 :
 :He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
 :Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
 :Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,
 :What rubbish, and what offal when it serves
 :For the base matter to illuminate
 :So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
S:
 :Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
 :
 :Before a willing bondman; then, I know
 :
 :My answer must be made. But I am armed,
 :
 :And dangers are to me indifferent.
 :
S:CASCA
 :
 :You speak to Casca, and to such a man
 :
 :That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.
 :
 :[They shake hands.]
 :Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
 :And I will set this foot of mine as far
S:As who goes farthest.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  There's a bargain made.
 :
 :Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
 :Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
 :To undergo with me an enterprise
 :Of honorable-dangerous consequence.
 :And I do know by this they stay for me
 :In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
S:
 :There is no stir or walking in the streets;
 :
 :And the complexion of the element
 :
 :In favor 's like the work we have in hand,
 :
S:Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cinna.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :
 :Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.
 :He is a friend.--Cinna, where haste you so?
 :
S:
S:CINNA
 :
 :To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :No, it is Casca, one incorporate
 :To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
S:
 :
 :CINNA
 :
 :I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
 :
 :There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Am I not stayed for? Tell me.
 :
 :CINNA
 :Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could
S:
 :But win the noble Brutus to our party--
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS, [handing him papers]
 :
 :Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
 :
 :And look you lay it in the Praetor's chair,
 :Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
 :In at his window; set this up with wax
 :Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done,
 :Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
S:Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
 :
 :
 :
 :CINNA
 :
 :All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
 :To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
 :And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :That done, repair to Pompey's Theater.
S:
 :[Cinna exits.]
 :
 :Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
 :
 :See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him
 :
 :Is ours already, and the man entire
 :Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
 :
 :CASCA
 :O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
S:
 :And that which would appear offense in us
 :
 :His countenance, like richest alchemy,
 :
 :Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Him and his worth and our great need of him
 :You have right well conceited. Let us go,
 :For it is after midnight, and ere day
S:
 :We will awake him and be sure of him.

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Brutus in his orchard.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  What, Lucius, ho!--
 :
 :I cannot by the progress of the stars
 :
 :Give guess how near to day.--Lucius, I say!--
 :I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.--
 :When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
S:
 :
 :[Enter Lucius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  Called you, my lord?
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
 :
 :When it is lighted, come and call me here.
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  I will, my lord.	[He exits.]
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :It must be by his death. And for my part
 :I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
S:
S:But for the general. He would be crowned:
 :
 :How that might change his nature, there's the
 :
 :question.
 :
 :It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
 :And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
 :And then I grant we put a sting in him
 :That at his will he may do danger with.
 :Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
 :Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar,
S:
S:I have not known when his affections swayed
 :
 :More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
 :
 :That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
 :
 :Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
 :But, when he once attains the upmost round,
 :He then unto the ladder turns his back,
S:Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
 :
 :By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
 :
 :Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel
 :
 :Will bear no color for the thing he is,
 :Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
 :Would run to these and these extremities.
 :And therefore think him as a serpent's egg,
 :Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow
 :mischievous,
S:
 :And kill him in the shell.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
S:Searching the window for a flint, I found
 :
 :This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure
 :
 :It did not lie there when I went to bed.
 :
 :[Gives him the letter.]
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Get you to bed again. It is not day.
 :
 :Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  I know not, sir.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
 :
S:
 :LUCIUS  I will, sir.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :The exhalations, whizzing in the air,
 :
 :Give so much light that I may read by them.
 :
 :[Opens the letter and reads.]
S:
 :
 :Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake, and see thyself!
 :
 :Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!
 :
 :"Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake."
S:Such instigations have been often dropped
 :
 :Where I have took them up.
 :
 :"Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out:
 :
 :Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What,
S:Rome?
 :
 :My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
 :
 :The Tarquin drive when he was called a king.
 :
 :"Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
S:To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
 :
 :If the redress will follow, thou receivest
 :
 :Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Lucius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS  Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
 :
 :[Knock within.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
 :[Lucius exits.]
 :Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
 :I have not slept.
 :Between the acting of a dreadful thing
S:
S:And the first motion, all the interim is
 :
 :Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
 :
 :The genius and the mortal instruments
 :
 :Are then in council, and the state of man,
 :Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
 :The nature of an insurrection.
 :
 :[Enter Lucius.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
 :Who doth desire to see you.
 :
S:BRUTUS  Is he alone?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :No, sir. There are more with him.
 :
 :BRUTUS  Do you know
S:them?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :
 :No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,
S:And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
 :
 :That by no means I may discover them
 :
S:By any mark of favor.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Let 'em enter.	[Lucius exits.]
 :
 :They are the faction. O conspiracy,
 :Sham'st thou to show thy dang'rous brow by night,
 :When evils are most free? O, then, by day
S:Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
 :
S:To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,
 :
 :conspiracy.
 :
 :Hide it in smiles and affability;
 :
S:For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
 :
 :Not Erebus itself were dim enough
 :
S:To hide thee from prevention.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,
 :
 :Metellus, and Trebonius.]
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :I think we are too bold upon your rest.
 :
 :Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :I have been up this hour, awake all night.
 :Know I these men that come along with you?
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:
 :Yes, every man of them; and no man here
 :
 :But honors you, and every one doth wish
 :
 :You had but that opinion of yourself
 :
S:Which every noble Roman bears of you.
 :
 :This is Trebonius.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  He is welcome hither.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :This, Decius Brutus.
 :
S:BRUTUS  He is welcome too.
 :
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  They are all welcome.
 :
 :What watchful cares do interpose themselves
 :
 :Betwixt your eyes and night?
 :
 :CASSIUS  Shall I entreat a word?
 :[Brutus and Cassius whisper.]
 :
 :DECIUS
S:
 :Here lies the east; doth not the day break here?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  No.
 :
S:
 :
 :CINNA
 :
 :O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
 :
 :That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
 :
 :CASCA
 :You shall confess that you are both deceived.
 :Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
 :Which is a great way growing on the south,
S:
 :Weighing the youthful season of the year.
 :
 :Some two months hence, up higher toward the
 :
S:north
 :
S:He first presents his fire, and the high east
 :
 :Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS, [coming forward with Cassius]
S:Give me your hands all over, one by one.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :And let us swear our resolution.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
 :The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse--
 :If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
S:
 :And every man hence to his idle bed.
 :
 :So let high-sighted tyranny range on
 :
 :Till each man drop by lottery. But if these--
 :
 :As I am sure they do--bear fire enough
 :To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
 :The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
 :What need we any spur but our own cause
 :To prick us to redress? What other bond
S:
 :Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
 :
 :And will not palter? And what other oath
 :
 :Than honesty to honesty engaged
 :
 :That this shall be or we will fall for it?
 :Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
 :Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls
 :That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
 :Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
S:
 :The even virtue of our enterprise,
 :
S:Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
 :
 :To think that or our cause or our performance
 :
 :Did need an oath, when every drop of blood
 :
 :That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
 :Is guilty of a several bastardy
 :If he do break the smallest particle
 :Of any promise that hath passed from him.
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:
S:But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
 :
 :I think he will stand very strong with us.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :Let us not leave him out.
 :
 :CINNA  No, by no means.
 :
 :METELLUS
S:
 :O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
 :
 :Will purchase us a good opinion
 :
 :And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
 :
 :It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.
S:Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
 :
 :But all be buried in his gravity.
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :O, name him not! Let us not break with him,
 :
 :For he will never follow anything
 :That other men begin.
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS  Then leave him out.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Indeed, he is not fit.
 :
 :DECIUS
 :Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:
S:Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
 :
 :Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
 :
 :Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
 :
 :A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
S:If he improve them, may well stretch so far
 :
 :As to annoy us all; which to prevent,
 :
 :Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
 :
 :To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
 :
 :Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
 :For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
S:Let's be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
 :
 :We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
 :
 :And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
 :
S:O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit
 :
 :And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
 :
 :Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,
 :
 :Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.
 :Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
 :Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.
 :And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
 :Stir up their servants to an act of rage
 :And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
S:
 :Our purpose necessary and not envious;
 :
S:Which so appearing to the common eyes,
 :
 :We shall be called purgers, not murderers.
 :
 :And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
 :
 :For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
 :When Caesar's head is off.
 :
S:CASSIUS  Yet I fear him,
 :
 :For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar--
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
 :If he love Caesar, all that he can do
 :Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.
 :And that were much he should, for he is given
 :To sports, to wildness, and much company.
S:
 :
 :
 :TREBONIUS
 :
 :There is no fear in him. Let him not die,
 :
 :For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
 :[Clock strikes.]
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Peace, count the clock.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  The clock hath stricken
S:three.
 :
S:
 :
 :TREBONIUS
 :
 :'Tis time to part.
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS  But it is doubtful yet
 :
 :Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
 :
 :For he is superstitious grown of late,
 :
 :Quite from the main opinion he held once
 :Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
 :It may be these apparent prodigies,
 :The unaccustomed terror of this night,
 :And the persuasion of his augurers
S:May hold him from the Capitol today.
 :
 :
 :
 :DECIUS
 :
 :Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
 :I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
 :That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,
S:And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
 :
S:Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.
 :
 :But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
 :
 :He says he does, being then most flattered.
 :
 :Let me work,
 :For I can give his humor the true bent,
S:And I will bring him to the Capitol.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?
 :
 :
 :
 :CINNA
 :Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
 :
 :METELLUS
S:Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
 :
 :Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
 :
 :I wonder none of you have thought of him.
 :
 :

 :Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
S:He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.
 :
 :Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you,
 :Brutus.
 :And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
 :What you have said, and show yourselves true
 :Romans.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.
 :
S:Let not our looks put on our purposes,
 :
 :But bear it, as our Roman actors do,
 :
 :With untired spirits and formal constancy.
 :
 :And so good morrow to you every one.
 :[All but Brutus exit.]
 :Boy! Lucius!--Fast asleep? It is no matter.
S:Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
 :
 :Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
 :
S:Which busy care draws in the brains of men.
 :
 :Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Portia.]
 :
 :
 :PORTIA  Brutus, my lord.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
 :
S:It is not for your health thus to commit
 :
 :Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
 :
S:
 :
 :PORTIA
 :
 :Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
 :
 :Stole from my bed. And yesternight at supper
 :You suddenly arose and walked about,
 :Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
 :And when I asked you what the matter was,
 :You stared upon me with ungentle looks.
 :I urged you further; then you scratched your head
S:
 :And too impatiently stamped with your foot.
 :
S:Yet I insisted; yet you answered not,
 :
 :But with an angry wafture of your hand
 :
 :Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,
 :
S:Fearing to strengthen that impatience
 :
 :Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal
 :
S:Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
 :
 :Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
 :
 :It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,
 :
 :And could it work so much upon your shape
 :As it hath much prevailed on your condition,
 :I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,
 :Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :I am not well in health, and that is all.
 :
S:
 :
 :PORTIA
 :
S:Brutus is wise and, were he not in health,
 :
S:He would embrace the means to come by it.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
 :
 :PORTIA
 :Is Brutus sick? And is it physical
 :To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
 :Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
S:
 :And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
 :
 :To dare the vile contagion of the night
 :
 :And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
 :
S:To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
 :
S:You have some sick offense within your mind,
 :
 :Which by the right and virtue of my place
 :
 :I ought to know of. [She kneels.] And upon my
 :
 :knees
 :I charm you, by my once commended beauty,
 :By all your vows of love, and that great vow
 :Which did incorporate and make us one,
 :That you unfold to me, your self, your half,
 :Why you are heavy, and what men tonight
S:
S:Have had resort to you; for here have been
 :
 :Some six or seven who did hide their faces
 :
 :Even from darkness.
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Kneel not, gentle Portia.
 :[He lifts her up.]
 :
 :PORTIA
S:I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
 :
 :Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
 :
S:Is it excepted I should know no secrets
 :
 :That appertain to you? Am I your self
 :
 :But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
 :
 :To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
 :And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the
 :suburbs
 :Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
 :Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
 :
S:
 :BRUTUS
 :
S:You are my true and honorable wife,
 :
 :As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
 :
 :That visit my sad heart.
 :
 :
S:PORTIA
 :
 :If this were true, then should I know this secret.
 :
S:I grant I am a woman, but withal
 :
 :A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
 :
 :I grant I am a woman, but withal
 :
 :A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
 :Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
 :Being so fathered and so husbanded?
 :Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose 'em.
 :I have made strong proof of my constancy,
 :Giving myself a voluntary wound
S:
 :Here, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience,
 :
 :And not my husband's secrets?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  O you gods,
 :Render me worthy of this noble wife!	[Knock.]
S:Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
 :
 :And by and by thy bosom shall partake
 :
 :The secrets of my heart.
 :
 :All my engagements I will construe to thee,
 :All the charactery of my sad brows.
 :Leave me with haste.	[Portia exits.]
 :Lucius, who 's that knocks?
 :
S:[Enter Lucius and Ligarius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.--
 :
 :Boy, stand aside.	[Lucius exits.]
 :
 :Caius Ligarius, how?
 :
 :
 :LIGARIUS
 :Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
 :
 :To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
 :
 :LIGARIUS
 :I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
S:Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
 :Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
 :
 :LIGARIUS
S:By all the gods that Romans bow before,
 :
 :I here discard my sickness.
 :
 :[He takes off his kerchief.]
 :
 :Soul of Rome,
 :Brave son derived from honorable loins,
S:Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
 :
S:My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
 :
 :And I will strive with things impossible,
 :
 :Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
 :
 :
 :LIGARIUS
 :But are not some whole that we must make sick?
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
 :
 :I shall unfold to thee as we are going
 :
 :To whom it must be done.
 :
 :
S:LIGARIUS  Set on your foot,
 :
 :And with a heart new-fired I follow you
 :
 :To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
 :
 :That Brutus leads me on.	[Thunder.]
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  Follow me then.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Thunder and lightning. Enter Julius Caesar in his
 :nightgown.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
S:CAESAR
 :
 :Nor heaven nor Earth have been at peace tonight.
 :
S:Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out
 :
 :"Help ho, they murder Caesar!"--Who's within?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  My lord.
 :
 :
S:CAESAR
 :
 :Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
 :
 :And bring me their opinions of success.
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  I will, my lord.	[He exits.]
 :
 :[Enter Calphurnia.]
 :
 :
S:
 :CALPHURNIA
 :
 :What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
 :
 :You shall not stir out of your house today.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me
 :Ne'er looked but on my back. When they shall see
S:The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
 :
 :
 :
 :CALPHURNIA
 :
 :Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
S:Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
 :
 :Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
 :
 :Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
 :
 :A lioness hath whelped in the streets,
 :And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.
S:Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
 :
 :In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
 :
 :Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.
 :
 :The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
 :Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
 :And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
 :O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,
 :And I do fear them.
 :
S:
 :CAESAR  What can be avoided
 :
 :Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
 :
 :Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
 :
 :Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
S:
 :
 :CALPHURNIA
 :
 :When beggars die there are no comets seen;
 :
 :The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of
 :princes.
 :
S:CAESAR
 :
 :Cowards die many times before their deaths;
 :
 :The valiant never taste of death but once.
 :
 :Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
 :It seems to me most strange that men should fear,
 :Seeing that death, a necessary end,
S:Will come when it will come.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :What say the augurers?
 :
 :SERVANT
 :They would not have you to stir forth today.
 :Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
S:
S:They could not find a heart within the beast.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
 :Caesar should be a beast without a heart
 :If he should stay at home today for fear.
 :No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well
 :That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
 :We are two lions littered in one day,
S:
S:And I the elder and more terrible.
 :
 :And Caesar shall go forth.
 :
S:
 :
S:CALPHURNIA  Alas, my lord,
 :
 :Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
 :
 :Do not go forth today. Call it my fear
 :
 :That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
 :We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,
 :And he shall say you are not well today.
 :Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.	[She kneels.]
 :
 :CAESAR
S:
 :Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
 :
 :And for thy humor I will stay at home.
 :
 :[He lifts her up.]
 :
 :
 :[Enter Decius.]
 :
 :Here's Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so.
 :
S:
S:DECIUS
 :
 :Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.
 :
 :I come to fetch you to the Senate House.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :And you are come in very happy time
 :To bear my greeting to the Senators
S:And tell them that I will not come today.
 :
 :Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser.
 :
 :I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.
 :
 :
 :CALPHURNIA
S:Say he is sick.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Shall Caesar send a lie?
 :
 :Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far,
S:To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth?
 :
 :Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
 :
 :
 :
 :DECIUS
 :Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
 :Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
 :
 :CAESAR
 :The cause is in my will. I will not come.
S:
 :That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
 :
 :But for your private satisfaction,
 :
S:Because I love you, I will let you know.
 :
S:Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.
 :
 :She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,
 :
 :Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
 :
 :Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans
S:Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
 :
 :And these does she apply for warnings and portents
 :
 :And evils imminent, and on her knee
 :
 :Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
 :
 :DECIUS
 :This dream is all amiss interpreted.
 :It was a vision fair and fortunate.
 :Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
S:
 :In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
 :
 :Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
 :
 :Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
 :
 :For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
 :This by Calphurnia's dream is signified.
 :
 :CAESAR
 :And this way have you well expounded it.
S:
S:
 :
 :DECIUS
 :
 :I have, when you have heard what I can say.
 :
S:And know it now: the Senate have concluded
 :
 :To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
 :
 :If you shall send them word you will not come,
 :
 :Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
 :Apt to be rendered, for someone to say
 :"Break up the Senate till another time,
 :When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
 :If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
 :"Lo, Caesar is afraid"?
S:
 :Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
 :
S:To your proceeding bids me tell you this,
 :
 :And reason to my love is liable.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
S:I am ashamed I did yield to them.
 :
 :Give me my robe, for I will go.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius,
 :Cinna, and Publius.]
S:
 :
 :And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
 :
 :
 :
 :PUBLIUS
 :Good morrow, Caesar.
 :
 :CAESAR  Welcome, Publius.--
 :What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?--
 :Good morrow, Casca.--Caius Ligarius,
S:
 :Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
 :
S:As that same ague which hath made you lean.--
 :
 :What is 't o'clock?
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
 :
 :[Enter Antony.]
 :
S:See, Antony that revels long a-nights
 :
 :Is notwithstanding up.--Good morrow, Antony.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  So to most noble Caesar.
 :
 :CAESAR, [to Servant]  Bid them prepare within.--
 :I am to blame to be thus waited for.	[Servant exits.]
 :Now, Cinna.--Now, Metellus.--What, Trebonius,
 :I have an hour's talk in store for you.
S:
 :Remember that you call on me today;
 :
 :Be near me that I may remember you.
 :
 :
 :
 :TREBONIUS
 :Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be
 :That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
 :
 :CAESAR
S:
 :Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,
 :
 :And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS, [aside]
 :
 :That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
 :
 :The heart of Brutus earns to think upon.

 :Yet in the number I do know but one
S:That unassailable holds on his rank,
 :
 :Unshaked of motion; and that I am he
 :
 :Let me a little show it, even in this:
 :
 :That I was constant Cimber should be banished
 :And constant do remain to keep him so.
S:

 :CINNA, [kneeling]
 :
S:O Caesar--
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
 :
 :
 :DECIUS, [kneeling]
 :Great Caesar--
S:
 :
 :CAESAR  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA  Speak, hands, for me!
S:[As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Et tu, Brute?--Then fall, Caesar.
 :
 :[He dies.]
 :
 :CINNA
 :Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
 :Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
 :
S:
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :Some to the common pulpits and cry out
 :
 :"Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement."
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:People and Senators, be not affrighted.
 :
 :Fly not; stand still. Ambition's debt is paid.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
 :
 :DECIUS  And Cassius too.
 :
 :BRUTUS  Where's Publius?
S:
 :
 :
 :CINNA
 :
 :Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
 :
 :
 :METELLUS
S:Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
 :
 :Should chance--
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Talk not of standing.--Publius, good cheer.
 :
 :There is no harm intended to your person,
 :Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,
 :Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Do so, and let no man abide this deed
 :
 :But we the doers.
 :[All but the Conspirators exit.]
S:
 :
 :[Enter Trebonius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Where is Antony?
 :
 :TREBONIUS  Fled to his house amazed.
 :Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run
 :As it were doomsday.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Fates, we will know your
 :
 :pleasures.
 :
 :That we shall die we know; 'tis but the time,
S:And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASCA
 :
S:Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
 :
 :Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:Grant that, and then is death a benefit.
 :
 :So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
 :
 :His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
 :
 :And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
 :Up to the elbows and besmear our swords.
 :Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
 :And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
 :Let's all cry "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Stoop then, and wash.
 :
 :[They smear their hands and swords with Caesar's blood.]
 :How many ages hence
 :Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
S:In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
S:How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
 :
 :That now on Pompey's basis lies along
 :
 :No worthier than the dust!
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS  So oft as that shall be,
 :
 :So often shall the knot of us be called
 :
 :The men that gave their country liberty.
 :
 :DECIUS
 :What, shall we forth?
 :
S:CASSIUS  Ay, every man away.
 :
 :Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
 :
 :With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
 :
 :SERVANT, [kneeling]
 :Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.
S:
S:Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
 :
 :And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
 :
 :Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
 :
 :Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
S:Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him;
 :
 :Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.
 :
 :If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
 :
 :May safely come to him and be resolved
 :How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
 :Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
 :So well as Brutus living, but will follow
 :The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
 :Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
S:
 :With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.
 :
 :I never thought him worse.
 :
 :Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
 :He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,
S:Depart untouched.
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  I'll fetch him presently.
 :
 :[Servant exits.]
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:I know that we shall have him well to friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :I wish we may; but yet have I a mind
S:That fears him much, and my misgiving still
 :
 :Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
 :
S:
 :
S:[Enter Antony.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :But here comes Antony.--Welcome, Mark Antony!
 :
 :ANTONY
S:O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?
 :
 :Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils
 :
 :Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.--
 :
 :I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
 :Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
 :If I myself, there is no hour so fit
 :As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument
 :Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
 :With the most noble blood of all this world.
S:
 :I do beseech you, if you bear me hard,
 :
 :Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
 :
 :Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
 :
S:I shall not find myself so apt to die;
 :
 :No place will please me so, no mean of death,
 :
 :As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
 :
 :The choice and master spirits of this age.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :O Antony, beg not your death of us!
 :Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
 :As by our hands and this our present act
S:
 :You see we do, yet see you but our hands
 :
 :And this the bleeding business they have done.
 :
 :Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
 :
 :And pity to the general wrong of Rome
 :(As fire drives out fire, so pity pity)
 :Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
 :To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.
 :Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
S:
 :Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
 :
S:With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
 :In the disposing of new dignities.
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Only be patient till we have appeased
 :
 :The multitude, beside themselves with fear;
 :
 :And then we will deliver you the cause
S:Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
 :
 :Have thus proceeded.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  I doubt not of your wisdom.
 :Let each man render me his bloody hand.
 :First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.--
 :Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.--
 :Now, Decius Brutus, yours;--now yours,
 :Metellus;--
S:
 :Yours, Cinna;--and, my valiant Casca, yours;--
 :
S:Though last, not least in love, yours, good
 :
S:Trebonius.--
 :
 :Gentlemen all--alas, what shall I say?
 :
 :My credit now stands on such slippery ground
 :
 :That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
 :Either a coward or a flatterer.--
S:That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
 :
 :If then thy spirit look upon us now,
 :
 :Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
 :
 :To see thy Antony making his peace,
S:Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes--
 :
 :Most noble!--in the presence of thy corpse?
 :
 :Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
 :
 :Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
 :It would become me better than to close
 :In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
 :Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave
 :hart,
 :Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand
S:
 :Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe.
 :
 :O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
 :
 :And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
 :
 :How like a deer strucken by many princes
 :Dost thou here lie!
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :Mark Antony--
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
 :The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
 :Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :I blame you not for praising Caesar so.
S:
 :But what compact mean you to have with us?
 :
 :Will you be pricked in number of our friends,
 :
 :Or shall we on and not depend on you?
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
 :Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.
 :Friends am I with you all and love you all,
S:
 :Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
 :
 :Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:Or else were this a savage spectacle.
 :
 :Our reasons are so full of good regard
 :
 :That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
 :
 :You should be satisfied.
S:
 :
 :ANTONY  That's all I seek;
 :
 :And am, moreover, suitor that I may
 :
 :Produce his body to the marketplace,
 :And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
 :Speak in the order of his funeral.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :You shall, Mark Antony.
S:
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Brutus, a word with you.
 :
 :[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do
 :
 :not consent
 :That Antony speak in his funeral.
S:Know you how much the people may be moved
 :
 :By that which he will utter?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS, [aside to Cassius]  By your pardon,
 :I will myself into the pulpit first
 :And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
 :What Antony shall speak I will protest
 :He speaks by leave and by permission,
 :And that we are contented Caesar shall
S:
S:Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
 :
 :It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS, [aside to Brutus]
 :I know not what may fall. I like it not.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
 :You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
S:
S:But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
 :
S:And say you do 't by our permission,
 :
 :Else shall you not have any hand at all
 :
 :About his funeral. And you shall speak
 :
 :In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
 :After my speech is ended.
 :
 :ANTONY  Be it so.
S:I do desire no more.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
 :[All but Antony exit.]
 :
 :ANTONY
 :O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
S:That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.
 :
 :Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
 :
S:That ever lived in the tide of times.
 :
 :Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
 :
 :Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
 :
 :(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
 :To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
 :A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
S:Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
 :
 :Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
 :
 :Blood and destruction shall be so in use
 :
 :And dreadful objects so familiar
 :That mothers shall but smile when they behold
 :Their infants quartered with the hands of war,
 :All pity choked with custom of fell deeds;
 :And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
 :With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
S:
 :Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
 :
 :Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
 :
 :That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
 :
 :With carrion men groaning for burial.
 :
S:[Enter Octavius' Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
S:You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT  I do, Mark Antony.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
 :
 :SERVANT
S:He did receive his letters and is coming,
 :
 :And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
 :
 :O Caesar!
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep.
 :Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
 :Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
 :Began to water. Is thy master coming?
S:
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
 :
 :He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Post back with speed and tell him what hath
S:chanced.
 :
 :Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
 :
 :No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.
 :
 :Hie hence and tell him so.--Yet stay awhile;
 :Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse
 :Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
 :In my oration, how the people take
 :The cruel issue of these bloody men,
 :According to the which thou shalt discourse
S:
S:To young Octavius of the state of things.
 :
 :Lend me your hand.
 :
 :[They exit with Caesar's body.]

 :Scene 2
 :=======
S:[Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PLEBEIANS
 :We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Then follow me and give me audience, friends.--
 :
 :Cassius, go you into the other street
 :And part the numbers.--
S:Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
 :
 :Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
 :
 :And public reasons shall be rendered
 :
 :Of Caesar's death.
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN  I will hear Brutus speak.
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN
S:I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons
 :
 :When severally we hear them rendered.
 :
 :[Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians.
 :
 :Brutus goes into the pulpit.]
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN
S:The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Be patient till the last.
 :
 :Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my
S:cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me
 :
 :for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor
 :
 :that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom,
 :
 :and awake your senses that you may the better
 :judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear
 :friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus' love
 :to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend
 :demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my
 :answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
S:
 :Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and
 :
 :die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all
 :
 :freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he
 :
 :was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I
 :honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.
 :There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor
 :for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is
 :here so base that would be a bondman? If any,
S:
 :speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude
 :
 :that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him
 :
 :have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not
 :
 :love his country? If any, speak, for him have I
 :offended. I pause for a reply.
S:
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  None, Brutus, none.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Then none have I offended. I have done no
S:more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The
 :
S:question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his
 :
 :glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor
 :
 :his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar's body.]
S:
 :
 :Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,
 :
S:who, though he had no hand in his death, shall
 :
 :receive the benefit of his dying--a place in the
 :
 :commonwealth--as which of you shall not? With
 :
 :this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the
 :good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself
 :when it shall please my country to need my death.
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  Live, Brutus, live, live!
 :
S:
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :
 :Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN
 :Give him a statue with his ancestors.
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN
 :Let him be Caesar.
S:
 :
 :
S:FOURTH PLEBEIAN  Caesar's better parts
 :
 :Shall be crowned in Brutus.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
S:We'll bring him to his house with shouts and
 :
 :clamors.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :My countrymen--
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN  Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN  Peace, ho!
S:
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
 :
 :And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
 :Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
 :Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony
S:(By our permission) is allowed to make.
 :
 :I do entreat you, not a man depart,
 :
 :Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
 :
 :[He descends and exits.]
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony!
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN
S:
 :Let him go up into the public chair.
 :
 :
 :
S:PLEBEIANS
 :
 :We'll hear him.--Noble Antony, go up.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
S:For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
 :
 :[He goes into the pulpit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN  What does he say of Brutus?
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN  He says for Brutus' sake
S:He finds himself beholding to us all.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN
 :
 :'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :This Caesar was a tyrant.
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN  Nay, that's certain.
S:
 :We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN
 :
 :Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :You gentle Romans--
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
 :
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :
S:The evil that men do lives after them;
 :
 :The good is oft interred with their bones.
 :
 :So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
 :
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
S:And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
 :
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest
 :
 :(For Brutus is an honorable man;
 :
S:So are they all, all honorable men),
 :
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me,
 :
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious,
S:And Brutus is an honorable man.
 :
 :He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
 :
 :Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
 :
 :Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
 :When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
 :Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
 :And Brutus is an honorable man.
 :You all did see that on the Lupercal
S:
 :I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
 :
 :Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
 :
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
 :
 :And sure he is an honorable man.
 :I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
 :But here I am to speak what I do know.
 :You all did love him once, not without cause.
 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for
S:
 :him?--
 :
 :O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
 :
 :And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
 :
 :My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
S:And I must pause till it come back to me.	[He weeps.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :
 :Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN
 :If thou consider rightly of the matter,
 :Caesar has had great wrong.
 :
S:
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN  Has he, masters?
 :
 :I fear there will a worse come in his place.
 :
 :
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN
 :Marked you his words? He would not take the
 :crown;
 :Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
 :
S:
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :
 :If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN
 :Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
 :
S:THIRD PLEBEIAN
 :
 :There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
 :
 :
 :
S:FOURTH PLEBEIAN
 :
S:Now mark him. He begins again to speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :But yesterday the word of Caesar might
S:Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,
 :
 :And none so poor to do him reverence.
 :
 :O masters, if I were disposed to stir
 :
 :Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
S:I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
 :
 :Who, you all know, are honorable men.
 :
 :I will not do them wrong. I rather choose
 :
 :To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
S:Than I will wrong such honorable men.
 :
 :But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
 :
S:I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will.
 :
 :Let but the commons hear this testament,
 :
 :Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,
 :
 :And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
 :And dip their napkins in his sacred blood--
 :Yea, beg a hair of him for memory
S:And, dying, mention it within their wills,
 :
 :Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
 :
 :Unto their issue.
 :
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN
 :We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
 :
 :PLEBEIANS
S:The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it.
S:It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
 :
 :You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.
 :
 :And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
 :
 :It will inflame you; it will make you mad.
 :'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
 :For if you should, O, what would come of it?
S:
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN
 :
S:Read the will! We'll hear it, Antony.
 :
 :
 :
 :PLEBEIANS
 :
 :You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
 :I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
 :I fear I wrong the honorable men
S:
 :Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.
 :
S:
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN  They were traitors. Honorable men?
 :
 :
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  The will! The testament!
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN  They were villains, murderers. The
S:will! Read the will.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :You will compel me, then, to read the will?
 :Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
 :And let me show you him that made the will.
 :Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  Come down.
S:
 :
 :
 :SECOND PLEBEIAN  Descend.
 :
 :
 :
S:THIRD PLEBEIAN  You shall have leave.
 :
 :[Antony descends.]
 :
 :
 :
 :FOURTH PLEBEIAN  A ring; stand round.
S:
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :
 :Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body.
 :
 :
S:SECOND PLEBEIAN
 :
 :Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
S:Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off.
 :
 :
 :
 :PLEBEIANS  Stand back! Room! Bear back!
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
 :You all do know this mantle. I remember
 :The first time ever Caesar put it on.
S:'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent,
 :
 :That day he overcame the Nervii.
 :
 :Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.
 :
 :See what a rent the envious Casca made.
S:Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,
 :
 :And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
 :
 :Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,
 :
 :As rushing out of doors to be resolved
 :If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;
 :For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.
 :Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
 :This was the most unkindest cut of all.
 :For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
S:
 :Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
 :
 :Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,
 :
 :And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
 :
 :Even at the base of Pompey's statue
 :(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.
 :O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
 :Then I and you and all of us fell down,
 :Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
S:
 :O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
 :
 :The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.
 :
 :Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold

 :Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
 :To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
 :They that have done this deed are honorable.
 :What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
S:
 :That made them do it. They are wise and honorable
 :
 :And will no doubt with reasons answer you.
 :
 :I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
 :
 :I am no orator, as Brutus is,
 :But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man
 :That love my friend, and that they know full well
 :That gave me public leave to speak of him.
 :For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
S:
 :Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech
 :
S:To stir men's blood. I only speak right on.
 :
 :I tell you that which you yourselves do know,
 :
 :Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb
 :
 :mouths,
 :And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
 :And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
 :Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
 :In every wound of Caesar that should move
 :The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
S:

 :
 :Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
 :
 :Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.

 :
 :PLEBEIANS
S:Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal:
 :To every Roman citizen he gives,
S:To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

 :
 :Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
 :
 :THIRD PLEBEIAN  O royal Caesar!
 :
 :ANTONY  Hear me with patience.
 :
S:
 :PLEBEIANS  Peace, ho!
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
 :
 :His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,
 :On this side Tiber. He hath left them you,
 :And to your heirs forever--common pleasures
S:To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
 :
 :Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST PLEBEIAN
 :Never, never!--Come, away, away!
 :We'll burn his body in the holy place
 :And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.

 :
S:

 :Then to answer every man directly and briefly,

S:

 :
 :
 :
S:CINNA  Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.

 :OCTAVIUS  So you thought him
S:And took his voice who should be pricked to die
 :
 :In our black sentence and proscription.

 :
S:ANTONY
 :
 :Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
 :
 :And, though we lay these honors on this man
 :
 :To ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads,
 :He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
 :To groan and sweat under the business,
 :Either led or driven, as we point the way;
 :And having brought our treasure where we will,
S:Then take we down his load and turn him off
 :
S:(Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears
 :
 :And graze in commons.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS  You may do your will,
 :But he's a tried and valiant soldier.

 :ANTONY
 :So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
 :I do appoint him store of provender.
S:
 :It is a creature that I teach to fight,
 :
 :To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
 :
S:His corporal motion governed by my spirit;
 :
 :And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so.
 :
 :He must be taught and trained and bid go forth--
 :
 :A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
S:On objects, arts, and imitations
 :
 :Which, out of use and staled by other men,
 :
 :Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him
 :
 :But as a property. And now, Octavius,
 :Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
 :Are levying powers. We must straight make head.
 :Therefore let our alliance be combined,
 :Our best friends made, our means stretched;
 :And let us presently go sit in council
S:
 :How covert matters may be best disclosed
 :
 :And open perils surest answered.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :Let us do so, for we are at the stake
 :And bayed about with many enemies,
 :And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
S:Millions of mischiefs.

S:BRUTUS

 :With courtesy and with respect enough,
 :But not with such familiar instances
 :Nor with such free and friendly conference
 :As he hath used of old.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Thou hast described
 :
 :A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
 :
 :When love begins to sicken and decay
 :It useth an enforced ceremony.
 :There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
 :But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
S:Make gallant show and promise of their mettle,
 :
 :[Low march within.]
 :
 :But when they should endure the bloody spur,
 :
 :They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades,

S:Scene 3
 :
 :=======
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :That you have wronged me doth appear in this:
 :You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella
 :For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
 :Wherein my letters, praying on his side
 :Because I knew the man, was slighted off.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :In such a time as this it is not meet
 :
 :That every nice offense should bear his comment.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
 :
 :Are much condemned to have an itching palm,
 :To sell and mart your offices for gold
 :To undeservers.
 :
 :CASSIUS  I an itching palm?
 :You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,
S:
 :Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
 :And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Chastisement?
 :
S:
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Remember March; the ides of March remember.
 :
 :Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
 :
S:What villain touched his body that did stab
 :
 :And not for justice? What, shall one of us
 :
 :That struck the foremost man of all this world
 :
 :But for supporting robbers, shall we now
 :Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
 :And sell the mighty space of our large honors
 :For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
 :I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
 :Than such a Roman.
S:
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS  Brutus, bait not me.
 :
 :I'll not endure it. You forget yourself
 :
 :To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
 :Older in practice, abler than yourself
 :To make conditions.
 :
 :BRUTUS  Go to! You are not, Cassius.
 :
S:
 :CASSIUS  I am.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  I say you are not.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Urge me no more. I shall forget myself.
 :Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther.
 :
S:
 :BRUTUS  Away, slight man!
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Is 't possible?
 :
 :BRUTUS  Hear me, for I will speak.
 :Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
 :Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
S:
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
 :Go show your slaves how choleric you are
 :And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
S:
 :Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
 :
 :Under your testy humor? By the gods,
 :
S:You shall digest the venom of your spleen
 :
 :Though it do split you. For, from this day forth,
 :
 :I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
 :
 :When you are waspish.
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS  Is it come to this?
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
S:You say you are a better soldier.
 :
 :Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,
 :
 :And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
 :
 :I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
 :I said an elder soldier, not a better.
S:Did I say "better"?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  If you did, I care not.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved
 :me.
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS  I durst not?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  No.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :What? Durst not tempt him?
 :
 :BRUTUS  For your life you durst
S:
 :not.

S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Do not presume too much upon my love.
 :
 :I may do that I shall be sorry for.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :You have done that you should be sorry for.
 :There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
S:For I am armed so strong in honesty
 :
 :That they pass by me as the idle wind,
 :
S:Which I respect not. I did send to you
 :
 :For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,
 :
S:For I can raise no money by vile means.
 :
 :By heaven, I had rather coin my heart
 :
 :And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
 :
 :From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
S:By any indirection. I did send
 :
 :To you for gold to pay my legions,
 :
 :Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?
 :
 :Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?
 :When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
 :To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
 :Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
 :Dash him to pieces!
 :
S:
 :CASSIUS  I denied you not.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  You did.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:I did not. He was but a fool that brought
 :
 :My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.
 :
 :A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
 :
 :But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :I do not, till you practice them on me.
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:
 :You love me not.
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  I do not like your faults.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:A friendly eye could never see such faults.
 :
 :

S:BRUTUS
 :
 :A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
 :
 :As huge as high Olympus.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come!
 :Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
 :For Cassius is aweary of the world--
 :Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,
S:
 :Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed,
 :
 :Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote
 :
 :To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
 :
 :My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
S:[Offering his dagger to Brutus.]
 :
 :And here my naked breast; within, a heart
 :
 :Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.
 :
 :If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth.
 :I that denied thee gold will give my heart.
 :Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know
 :When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him
 :better
 :Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Sheathe your
 :
 :dagger.
 :
 :Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.
 :Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
S:O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
 :
 :That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
 :
 :Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
 :
S:And straight is cold again.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Hath Cassius lived
 :
 :To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
S:When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
 :

S:BRUTUS  Yes, Cassius, and from

 :
 :When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
 :
 :He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Speak no more of her.--Give me a bowl of wine.--
 :
 :In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.	[He drinks.]
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.--
 :Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
S:
 :I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.	[He drinks.]
 :
S:[Lucius exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Titinius and Messala.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.
 :Now sit we close about this taper here,
 :And call in question our necessities.	[They sit.]
S:
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Portia, art thou gone?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  No more, I pray you.--
 :Messala, I have here received letters
 :That young Octavius and Mark Antony
 :Come down upon us with a mighty power,
S:
 :Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  With what addition?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
 :Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
 :Have put to death an hundred senators.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :Therein our letters do not well agree.
 :
 :Mine speak of seventy senators that died
 :
 :By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS
 :
 :Cicero one?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA  Cicero is dead,
S:And by that order of proscription.
 :
 :Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  No, Messala.
 :
S:
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
 :
 :
 :BRUTUSNothing, Messala.
 :
S:MESSALA  That methinks is strange.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
 :
 :MESSALA  No, my lord.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
S:Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,
S:For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
 :With meditating that she must die once,
 :I have the patience to endure it now.
S:
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Even so great men great losses should endure.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :I have as much of this in art as you,
S:But yet my nature could not bear it so.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Well, to our work alive. What do you think
 :
 :Of marching to Philippi presently?
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  I do not think it good.
 :
 :BRUTUS  Your reason?
 :
 :CASSIUS  This it is:
S:
 :'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
 :
 :So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
 :
 :Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still,
 :
 :Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Good reasons must of force give place to better.
 :The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
S:
 :Do stand but in a forced affection,
 :
 :For they have grudged us contribution.
 :
 :The enemy, marching along by them,
 :
 :By them shall make a fuller number up,
 :Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged,
S:From which advantage shall we cut him off
 :
 :If at Philippi we do face him there,
 :
 :These people at our back.
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Hear me, good brother--
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Under your pardon. You must note besides
 :That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
S:
 :Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe.
 :
 :The enemy increaseth every day;
 :
 :We, at the height, are ready to decline.
 :
S:There is a tide in the affairs of men
 :
 :Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
 :
 :Omitted, all the voyage of their life
 :
S:Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
 :
S:On such a full sea are we now afloat,
 :
 :And we must take the current when it serves
 :
S:Or lose our ventures.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Then, with your will, go on;
 :
 :We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
 :
 :And nature must obey necessity,
 :
 :Which we will niggard with a little rest.
 :
 :There is no more to say.
 :
 :CASSIUS  No more. Good night.
 :[They stand.]
 :Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
S:
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Lucius.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucius.]
 :
S:My gown.	[Lucius exits.]
 :
 :Farewell, good Messala.--
 :
 :Good night, Titinius.--Noble, noble Cassius,
 :
 :Good night and good repose.
 :
 :CASSIUS  O my dear brother,
 :This was an ill beginning of the night.
 :Never come such division 'tween our souls!
 :Let it not, Brutus.
S:
 :
 :
S:[Enter Lucius with the gown.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Everything is well.
 :
S:CASSIUS  Good night, my lord.
 :

 :
 :
 :TITINIUS/MESSALA
 :Good night, Lord Brutus.
 :
S:BRUTUS  Farewell, everyone.
 :
 :[All but Brutus and Lucius exit.]
 :
 :Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
 :
 :
S:LUCIUS
 :
 :Here in the tent.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  What, thou speak'st drowsily?
 :Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'erwatched.
 :Call Claudius and some other of my men;
 :I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
 :
 :LUCIUS  Varro and Claudius.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Varro and Claudius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :VARRO  Calls my lord?
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.
 :
 :It may be I shall raise you by and by
 :
 :On business to my brother Cassius.
 :
 :
 :VARRO
 :So please you, we will stand and watch your
 :pleasure.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
 :
 :It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
 :
 :[They lie down.]
 :
 :Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so.
 :I put it in the pocket of my gown.
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :I was sure your Lordship did not give it me.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
 :
 :Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
 :And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
 :
 :LUCIUS
 :Ay, my lord, an 't please you.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  It does, my boy.
 :
 :I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  It is my duty, sir.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :I should not urge thy duty past thy might.
S:
 :I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  I have slept, my lord, already.
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.
 :I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
S:I will be good to thee.
 :
 :[Music and a song. Lucius then falls asleep.]
 :
 :This is a sleepy tune. O murd'rous slumber,
 :
 :Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
 :That plays thee music?--Gentle knave, good night.
 :I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
 :If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument.
 :I'll take it from thee and, good boy, good night.
 :[He moves the instrument.]
S:
 :Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down
 :
 :Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
 :
 :How ill this taper burns.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter the Ghost of Caesar.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Ha, who comes here?--
 :I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
 :That shapes this monstrous apparition.
 :It comes upon me.--Art thou any thing?
 :Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
 :That mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare?
S:
 :Speak to me what thou art.
 :
 :
 :
S:GHOST
 :
 :Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Why com'st thou?
 :
 :GHOST
 :To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  Well, then I shall see thee again?
 :
 :
 :
 :GHOST  Ay, at Philippi.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	[Ghost exits.]
 :Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.
 :Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.--
S:
 :Boy, Lucius!--Varro, Claudius, sirs, awake!
 :
 :Claudius!
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCIUS  The strings, my lord, are false.
S:

 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Octavius, Antony, and their army.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :
 :Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
 :You said the enemy would not come down
 :But keep the hills and upper regions.
 :It proves not so; their battles are at hand.
 :They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
 :Answering before we do demand of them.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
 :
 :Wherefore they do it. They could be content
 :To visit other places, and come down
 :With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
 :To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.
S:But 'tis not so.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  Prepare you, generals.
 :The enemy comes on in gallant show.
 :Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
S:And something to be done immediately.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Octavius, lead your battle softly on
 :Upon the left hand of the even field.
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :Upon the right hand, I; keep thou the left.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Why do you cross me in this exigent?
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :I do not cross you, but I will do so.	[March.]
 :
 :[Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their army including
 :Lucilius, Titinius, and Messala.]
S:
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :BRUTUS  They stand and would have parley.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk.
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
 :
 :Make forth. The Generals would have some words.
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS, [to his Officers]  Stir not until the signal.
 :[The Generals step forward.]
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :Words before blows; is it so, countrymen?
 :
S:
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :
S:Not that we love words better, as you do.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
S:Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
 :
 :Crying "Long live, hail, Caesar!"
 :
 :
 :
S:CASSIUS  Antony,
 :
 :The posture of your blows are yet unknown,
 :
 :But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees
 :
 :And leave them honeyless.
 :
 :ANTONY  Not stingless too.
 :
 :BRUTUS  O yes, and soundless too,
 :For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,
S:
S:And very wisely threat before you sting.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
S:Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers
 :
 :Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.
 :
 :You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like
 :
 :hounds
 :And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet,
 :Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
 :Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:
 :Flatterers?--Now, Brutus, thank yourself!
 :
 :This tongue had not offended so today
 :
 :If Cassius might have ruled.
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
 :The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
 :Look, I draw a sword against conspirators;
S:
 :[He draws.]
 :
 :When think you that the sword goes up again?
 :
 :Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
 :
 :Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
 :Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands
 :
 :Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS  So I hope.
S:I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
 :Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,
 :Joined with a masker and a reveler!
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
S:Old Cassius still.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS  Come, Antony, away!--
 :
 :Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
S:If you dare fight today, come to the field;
 :
S:If not, when you have stomachs.
 :
 :[Octavius, Antony, and their army exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
S:Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
 :
 :The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you.
 :[Lucilius and Messala stand forth.]
 :
 :LUCILIUS  My lord?
 :[Brutus and Lucilius step aside together.]
S:
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Messala.
 :
S:
 :
 :MESSALA  What says my general?
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  Messala,
 :This is my birthday, as this very day
 :Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.
 :Be thou my witness that against my will
 :(As Pompey was) am I compelled to set
 :Upon one battle all our liberties.
S:
 :You know that I held Epicurus strong
 :
 :And his opinion. Now I change my mind
 :
 :And partly credit things that do presage.
 :
S:Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
 :
 :Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,
 :
 :Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,
 :
 :Who to Philippi here consorted us.
 :This morning are they fled away and gone,
 :And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
 :Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
 :As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem
 :A canopy most fatal, under which
S:
 :Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
S:Believe not so.
 :
 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  I but believe it partly,
 :
 :For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
S:To meet all perils very constantly.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Even so, Lucilius.	[Brutus returns to Cassius.]
 :
 :CASSIUS  Now, most noble Brutus,
 :The gods today stand friendly that we may,
 :Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.
S:But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,
 :
 :Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
 :
 :If we do lose this battle, then is this
 :
 :The very last time we shall speak together.
 :What are you then determined to do?
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Even by the rule of that philosophy
 :By which I did blame Cato for the death
S:
 :Which he did give himself (I know not how,
 :
 :But I do find it cowardly and vile,
 :
 :For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
 :
 :The time of life), arming myself with patience
 :To stay the providence of some high powers
 :That govern us below.
 :
 :CASSIUS  Then, if we lose this battle,
S:
 :You are contented to be led in triumph
 :
 :Thorough the streets of Rome?
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
S:That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.
 :
 :He bears too great a mind. But this same day
 :
S:Must end that work the ides of March begun.
 :
 :And whether we shall meet again, I know not.
 :
 :Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
 :
 :Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.
 :If we do meet again, why we shall smile;
 :If not, why then this parting was well made.
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.
S:
 :If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
 :
 :If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Why then, lead on.--O, that a man might know
 :The end of this day's business ere it come!
 :But it sufficeth that the day will end,
 :And then the end is known.--Come ho, away!

S:O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!

 :Myself have to mine own turned enemy.

 :
S:TITINIUS
 :
 :O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
 :
 :Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
 :
 :Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
 :Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
S:

S:

S:CASSIUS  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
 :
 :Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him

 :Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
 :
 :And here again, that I may rest assured
 :Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
 :
 :TITINIUS
 :I will be here again even with a thought.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :CASSIUS
 :
 :Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.
 :
 :My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius
 :And tell me what thou not'st about the field.
 :[Pindarus goes up.]
S:This day I breathed first. Time is come round,
 :
 :And where I did begin, there shall I end;
 :
S:My life is run his compass.--Sirrah, what news?
 :
 :
 :
S:PINDARUS, [above.]  O my lord!

 :
 :
 :CASSIUS  What news?
 :
 :
S:PINDARUS
 :
 :Titinius is enclosed round about
 :
 :With horsemen that make to him on the spur,
 :
 :Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
 :Now Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
 :He's ta'en.	[Shout.]
 :And hark, they shout for joy.
 :
S:CASSIUS  Come down, behold no more.--
 :
 :O, coward that I am to live so long
 :
 :To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
 :
 :[Pindarus comes down.]
 :Come hither, sirrah.
 :In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
 :And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
 :That whatsoever I did bid thee do
 :Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine
S:
 :oath.
 :
S:Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
 :
 :That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this
 :
 :bosom.
 :
 :Stand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts,
 :And, when my face is covered, as 'tis now,
 :Guide thou the sword.	[Pindarus stabs him.]
 :Caesar, thou art revenged
 :Even with the sword that killed thee.	[He dies.]
 :
S:
 :PINDARUS
 :
 :So I am free, yet would not so have been,
 :
 :Durst I have done my will.--O Cassius!--

S:Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
 :
 :Where never Roman shall take note of him.

S:[Enter Titinius and Messala.]

 :As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
S:

 :
 :These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :Where did you leave him?
 :
S:TITINIUS  All disconsolate,
 :
 :With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
 :
S:
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
 :
 :
 :TITINIUS
S:He lies not like the living. O my heart!
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Is not that he?
 :
 :TITINIUS  No, this was he, Messala,
 :But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
 :As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,
 :So in his red blood Cassius' day is set.
S:
 :The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;
 :
 :Clouds, dews, and dangers come. Our deeds are
 :
 :done.
 :
 :Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
S:
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
 :Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
 :
 :O hateful error, melancholy's child,
 :Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
 :The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
 :Thou never com'st unto a happy birth
 :But kill'st the mother that engendered thee!
 :
S:
 :TITINIUS
 :
S:What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA
 :
S:Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
 :
 :The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
 :
 :Into his ears. I may say "thrusting it,"
 :
 :For piercing steel and darts envenomed
 :Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
 :As tidings of this sight.
 :
 :TITINIUS  Hie you, Messala,
 :And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
S:
S:[Messala exits.]

 :Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?

 :Put on my brows this wreath of victory
 :And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their
 :shouts?
 :Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything.
 :But hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.
S:[Laying the garland on Cassius' brow.]
 :
S:Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
 :
 :Will do his bidding.--Brutus, come apace,
 :
 :And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.--
 :
 :By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
 :Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart!
 :[He dies on Cassius' sword.]
 :
S:[Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Strato,
 :
 :Volumnius, and Lucilius, Labeo, and Flavius.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
 :
 :MESSALA
 :Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
S:
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Titinius' face is upward.
 :
 :
 :CATO  He is slain.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet;
 :
 :Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
 :
 :In our own proper entrails.	[Low alarums.]
 :
 :
S:CATO  Brave Titinius!--
 :
 :Look whe'er he have not crowned dead Cassius.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Are yet two Romans living such as these?--
 :The last of all the Romans, fare thee well.
S:It is impossible that ever Rome
 :
 :Should breed thy fellow.--Friends, I owe more
 :
 :tears
 :
 :To this dead man than you shall see me pay.--
 :I shall find time, Cassius; I shall find time.--
 :Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.
S:His funerals shall not be in our camp,
 :
 :Lest it discomfort us.--Lucilius, come.--
 :
 :And come, young Cato. Let us to the field.--
 :
 :Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on.
S:'Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night
 :
 :We shall try fortune in a second fight.
 :
 :[They exit.]

S:
 :

 :
S:Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
 :
 :[Brutus, Messala, and Flavius exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CATO
 :What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
 :I will proclaim my name about the field.
 :I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
 :A foe to tyrants and my country's friend.
 :I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Soldiers and fight.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCILIUS
 :And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!
S:Brutus, my country's friend! Know me for Brutus.
 :
 :[Cato is killed.]
 :
 :O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
 :
 :Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius
 :And mayst be honored, being Cato's son.
 :
S:FIRST SOLDIER, [seizing Lucilius]
 :
 :Yield, or thou diest.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCILIUS  Only I yield to die.
S:There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.

S:
 :
 :ANTONY  Where is he?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCILIUS
 :Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
 :I dare assure thee that no enemy
 :Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.
 :The gods defend him from so great a shame!
 :When you do find him, or alive or dead,
S:
 :He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
 :
 :

 :ANTONY
 :
 :This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you,
 :A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe.
 :Give him all kindness. I had rather have
 :Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
S:And see whe'er Brutus be alive or dead,
 :
 :And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
 :
 :How everything is chanced.

S:
 :Scene 5
 :=======
 :[Enter Brutus, Dardanus, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :
 :Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
 :[He sits down.]
 :
 :CLITUS
 :Statilius showed the torchlight, but, my lord,
S:He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word;
 :
 :It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
 :
 :[He whispers to Clitus.]
 :
 :CLITUS
 :What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:
 :Peace, then, no words.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLITUS  I'll rather kill myself.
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Hark thee, Dardanus.	[He whispers to Dardanus.]
S:
 :
 :DARDANUS  Shall I do such a deed?
 :
 :
 :
S:CLITUS  O Dardanus!
 :
 :
 :
 :DARDANUS  O Clitus!
 :
 :[Dardanus and Clitus step aside.]
 :
 :CLITUS
 :What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
 :
 :DARDANUS
S:
 :To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLITUS
 :
S:Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
 :
 :That it runs over even at his eyes.
 :
 :
 :
S:BRUTUS
 :
 :Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word.
 :
 :
 :
 :VOLUMNIUS
 :What says my lord?
 :
 :BRUTUS  Why this, Volumnius:
S:The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me
 :
 :Two several times by night--at Sardis once
 :
S:And this last night here in Philippi fields.
 :
 :I know my hour is come.
 :
 :
 :
 :VOLUMNIUS  Not so, my lord.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
 :Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
 :Our enemies have beat us to the pit.	[Low alarums.]
S:
 :It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
 :
 :Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
 :
 :Thou know'st that we two went to school together;
 :
S:Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
 :
 :Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it.
 :
 :
 :
 :VOLUMNIUS
S:That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
 :
 :[Alarum continues.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CLITUS
 :Fly, fly, my lord! There is no tarrying here.
 :
 :BRUTUS
 :Farewell to you--and you--and you, Volumnius.--
 :Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.
S:
 :Farewell to thee, too, Strato.--Countrymen,
 :
 :My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
 :
 :I found no man but he was true to me.
 :
S:I shall have glory by this losing day
 :
 :More than Octavius and Mark Antony
 :
S:By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
 :
 :So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue
 :
 :Hath almost ended his life's history.
 :
S:Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
 :
 :That have but labored to attain this hour.
 :
 :[Alarum. Cry within "Fly, fly, fly!"]
 :
S:
 :
S:CLITUS
 :
S:Fly, my lord, fly!
 :
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS  Hence. I will follow.
 :
 :[All exit but Brutus and Strato.]
 :I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
 :Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
 :Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
 :Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face
 :While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
S:
 :
 :
 :STRATO
 :
 :Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
 :
 :
 :BRUTUS
S:Farewell, good Strato.
 :
 :[Brutus runs on his sword.]
 :
S:Caesar, now be still.
 :
 :I killed not thee with half so good a will.	[He dies.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala,
 :Lucilius, and the army.]
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS  What man is that?
 :
S:
 :MESSALA
 :
 :My master's man.--Strato, where is thy master?
 :
 :
 :
 :STRATO
 :Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
 :The conquerors can but make a fire of him,
 :For Brutus only overcame himself,
 :And no man else hath honor by his death.
S:
 :
 :
S:LUCILIUS
 :
 :So Brutus should be found.--I thank thee, Brutus,
 :
 :That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.--
 :Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
 :
S:STRATO
 :
 :Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
 :
 :
 :
S:OCTAVIUS
 :
S:Do so, good Messala.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSALA  How died my master, Strato?
 :
 :
 :STRATO
 :I held the sword, and he did run on it.
 :
 :MESSALA
S:Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
 :
 :That did the latest service to my master.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :This was the noblest Roman of them all.
 :All the conspirators save only he
 :Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.
 :He only in a general honest thought
 :And common good to all made one of them.
S:
 :His life was gentle and the elements
 :
 :So mixed in him that nature might stand up
 :
 :And say to all the world "This was a man."
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIUS
 :According to his virtue, let us use him
 :With all respect and rites of burial.
S:Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,
 :
 :Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
 :
 :So call the field to rest, and let's away
 :
 :To part the glories of this happy day.
 :[They all exit.]
