 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Beggar (Christopher Sly) and Hostess.]
 :
 :
 :SLY  I'll feeze you, in faith.
 :
S:
 :HOSTESS  A pair of stocks, you rogue!
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  You're a baggage! The Slys are no rogues. Look
 :
S:in the chronicles. We came in with Richard Conqueror.
 :
 :Therefore, paucas pallabris, let the world
 :
 :slide. Sessa!
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  You will not pay for the glasses you have
 :burst?
 :
 :SLY  No, not a denier. Go, by Saint Jeronimy! Go to
 :thy cold bed and warm thee.	[He lies down.]
S:
 :
 :
 :HOSTESS  I know my remedy. I must go fetch the
 :
 :headborough.	[She exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :SLY  Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
 :
 :by law. I'll not budge an inch, boy. Let him come,
 :
 :and kindly.	[Falls asleep.]
 :
 :[Wind horns within. Enter a Lord from hunting, with
S:his train.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :Huntsman, I charge thee tender well my hounds.
 :Breathe Merriman (the poor cur is embossed)
S:And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.
 :
 :Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
 :
 :At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
 :
 :I would not lose the dog for twenty pound!
 :
 :FIRST HUNTSMAN
S:Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord.
 :
S:He cried upon it at the merest loss,
 :
 :And twice today picked out the dullest scent.
 :
 :Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :Thou art a fool. If Echo were as fleet,
 :I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
 :But sup them well, and look unto them all.
 :Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST HUNTSMAN  I will, my lord.
 :
 :[First Huntsman exits.]
 :
 :
 :LORD, [noticing Sly]
 :What's here? One dead, or drunk? See doth he
 :breathe.
 :
S:
 :SECOND HUNTSMAN
 :
 :He breathes, my lord. Were he not warmed with ale,
 :
 :This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
 :
 :
S:LORD
 :
 :O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
 :
 :Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
 :
 :Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.
 :What think you, if he were conveyed to bed,
 :Wrapped in sweet clothes, rings put upon his
 :fingers,
 :A most delicious banquet by his bed,
S:And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
 :
 :Would not the beggar then forget himself?
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD HUNTSMAN
 :Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
 :
 :SECOND HUNTSMAN
 :It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
 :
S:
 :LORD
 :
 :Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.
 :
 :Then take him up, and manage well the jest.
 :
 :Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
 :And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
 :Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
 :And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
 :Procure me music ready when he wakes
S:
 :To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound.
 :
 :And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
 :
 :And, with a low, submissive reverence,
 :
 :Say "What is it your Honor will command?"
 :Let one attend him with a silver basin
 :Full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers,
 :Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
S:And say "Will 't please your Lordship cool your
 :
S:hands?"
 :
 :Someone be ready with a costly suit,
 :
 :And ask him what apparel he will wear.
 :
 :Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
 :And that his lady mourns at his disease.
 :Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
 :And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
 :For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
 :This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs.
S:
 :It will be pastime passing excellent
 :
 :If it be husbanded with modesty.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD HUNTSMAN
 :My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
 :As he shall think by our true diligence
S:He is no less than what we say he is.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :
 :Take him up gently, and to bed with him,
 :And each one to his office when he wakes.
 :[Sly is carried out.]
 :[Sound trumpets within.]
 :Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds.
S:[Servingman exits.]
 :
 :Belike some noble gentleman that means
 :
 :(Traveling some journey) to repose him here.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Servingman.]
 :
 :How now? Who is it?
 :
S:SERVINGMAN  An 't please your Honor, players
 :
 :That offer service to your Lordship.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
S:Bid them come near.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Players.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Now, fellows, you are welcome.
 :
 :
 :PLAYERS  We thank your Honor.
 :
 :LORD
 :Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
 :
S:
 :FIRST PLAYER
 :
S:So please your Lordship to accept our duty.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD
 :
 :With all my heart. This fellow I remember
S:Since once he played a farmer's eldest son.--
 :
 :'Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.
 :
S:I have forgot your name, but sure that part
 :
 :Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND PLAYER
 :I think 'twas Soto that your Honor means.
 :
 :LORD
 :'Tis very true. Thou didst it excellent.
 :Well, you are come to me in happy time,
S:
 :The rather for I have some sport in hand
 :
 :Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
 :
 :There is a lord will hear you play tonight;
 :
S:But I am doubtful of your modesties,
 :
 :Lest, over-eying of his odd behavior
 :
 :(For yet his Honor never heard a play),
 :
 :You break into some merry passion,
 :And so offend him. For I tell you, sirs,
 :If you should smile, he grows impatient.
S:
 :
 :FIRST PLAYER
 :
 :Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves
 :
 :Were he the veriest antic in the world.
 :
 :LORD, [to a Servingman]
 :Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery
 :And give them friendly welcome every one.
 :Let them want nothing that my house affords.
S:
 :[One exits with the Players.]
 :
 :Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew, my page,
 :
 :And see him dressed in all suits like a lady.
 :
 :That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,
 :And call him "Madam," do him obeisance.
 :Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
 :He bear himself with honorable action,
S:Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
 :
 :Unto their lords, by them accomplished.
 :
S:Such duty to the drunkard let him do
 :
 :With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
 :
 :And say "What is 't your Honor will command,
 :
 :Wherein your lady and your humble wife
 :May show her duty and make known her love?"
 :And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
S:And with declining head into his bosom,
 :
 :Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
 :
 :To see her noble lord restored to health,
 :
 :Who, for this seven years, hath esteemed him
 :No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
S:And if the boy have not a woman's gift
 :
 :To rain a shower of commanded tears,
 :
 :An onion will do well for such a shift,
 :
 :Which (in a napkin being close conveyed)
 :Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
 :See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst.
 :Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
 :[A Servingman exits.]
 :I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
S:
 :Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.
 :
S:I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband"!
 :
 :And how my men will stay themselves from
 :
 :laughter
 :
 :When they do homage to this simple peasant,
S:I'll in to counsel them. Haply my presence
 :
 :May well abate the over-merry spleen
 :
S:Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
 :
 :[They exit.]

 :=======
 :[Enter aloft Christopher Sly, the drunkard, with
 :Attendants, some with apparel, basin and ewer, and
 :other appurtenances, and Lord dressed as an Attendant.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :SLY  For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
 :Will 't please your Lord drink a cup of sack?
S:
 :
 :SECOND SERVINGMAN
 :
 :Will 't please your Honor taste of these conserves?
 :
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN
S:What raiment will your Honor wear today?
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  I am Christophero Sly! Call not me "Honor" nor
 :
 :"Lordship." I ne'er drank sack in my life. An if you
 :give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef.
 :Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I have no
S:more doublets than backs, no more stockings than
 :
S:legs, nor no more shoes than feet, nay sometime
 :
S:more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look
 :
 :through the over-leather.
 :
S:
 :
 :LORD, [as Attendant]
 :
S:Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor!
 :
 :O, that a mighty man of such descent,
 :
S:Of such possessions, and so high esteem
 :
 :Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
 :
 :
 :
S:SLY  What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
 :
 :Sly, old Sly's son of Burton Heath, by birth a
 :
 :peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation
 :
S:a bearherd, and now by present profession a
 :
 :tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot,
 :
 :if she know me not! If she say I am not fourteen
 :
 :pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
 :lying'st knave in Christendom. What, I am not
 :bestraught! Here's--
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN
S:O, this it is that makes your lady mourn.
 :
 :
 :
S:SECOND SERVINGMAN
 :
 :O, this is it that makes your servants droop.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD, [as Attendant]
 :Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
 :As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
 :O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
 :Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
 :And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
S:
 :Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
 :
 :Each in his office ready at thy beck.
 :
 :Wilt thou have music? Hark, Apollo plays,	[Music.]
 :
 :And twenty caged nightingales do sing.
 :Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
S:Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
 :
 :On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.
 :
 :Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground.
 :
 :Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapped,
 :Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
 :Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
S:Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
 :
 :Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
 :
 :And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
S:Say thou wilt course. Thy greyhounds are as swift
 :
S:As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND SERVINGMAN
 :
 :Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight
 :Adonis painted by a running brook,
S:And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
 :
 :Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
 :
 :Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
 :
 :
 :LORD, [as Attendant]
 :We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
 :And how she was beguiled and surprised,
S:As lively painted as the deed was done.
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN
 :
 :Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
S:Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
 :
 :And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
 :
S:So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
 :
 :
 :
 :LORD, [as Attendant]
 :
 :Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord;
 :Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
 :Than any woman in this waning age.
S:
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
 :
 :And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
 :
 :Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face,
S:She was the fairest creature in the world--
 :
 :And yet she is inferior to none.
 :
S:
 :
 :SLY
 :
 :Am I a lord, and have I such a lady?
 :
 :Or do I dream? Or have I dreamed till now?
 :I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak,
 :I smell sweet savors, and I feel soft things.
 :Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
 :And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
 :Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,
S:
 :And once again a pot o' the smallest ale.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND SERVINGMAN
 :
 :Will 't please your Mightiness to wash your hands?
 :O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
S:O, that once more you knew but what you are!
 :
 :These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
 :
 :Or, when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
 :
 :
 :SLY
S:These fifteen years! By my fay, a goodly nap.
 :
 :But did I never speak of all that time?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
 :Oh, yes, my lord, but very idle words.
S:For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
 :
 :Yet would you say you were beaten out of door,
 :
 :And rail upon the hostess of the house,
 :
 :And say you would present her at the leet
 :Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed
S:quarts.
 :
S:Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
 :
 :
 :THIRD SERVINGMAN
 :Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid,
 :Nor no such men as you have reckoned up,
 :As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greete,
 :And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell,
S:
 :And twenty more such names and men as these,
 :
 :Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
 :
S:
 :
S:SLY  Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
 :
 :
 :
S:ALL  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  I thank thee. Thou shalt not lose by it.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Page as Lady, with Attendants.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]  How fares my noble lord?
 :
 :
 :SLY  Marry, I fare well, for here is cheer enough.
S:Where is my wife?
 :
 :
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]
 :
 :Here, noble lord. What is thy will with her?
 :
 :SLY
 :Are you my wife, and will not call me "husband"?
 :My men should call me "lord." I am your goodman.
 :
S:
S:PAGE, [as Lady]
 :
 :My husband and my lord, my lord and husband,
 :
 :I am your wife in all obedience.
 :
S:
 :
 :SLY
 :
 :I know it well.--What must I call her?
 :
 :
S:LORD, [as Attendant]  "Madam."
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  "Alice Madam," or "Joan Madam"?
 :
 :
S:LORD
 :
 :"Madam," and nothing else. So lords call ladies.
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY
 :Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed
 :And slept above some fifteen year or more.
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]
 :Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
S:
 :Being all this time abandoned from your bed.
 :
S:
 :
 :SLY
 :
 :'Tis much.--Servants, leave me and her alone.--
 :
 :Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]
 :Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
 :To pardon me yet for a night or two;
 :Or if not so, until the sun be set.
S:
 :For your physicians have expressly charged,
 :
S:In peril to incur your former malady,
 :
 :That I should yet absent me from your bed.
 :
 :I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
 :
 :
 :SLY  Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but
 :I would be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will
 :therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the
 :blood.
 :
S:
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:MESSENGER
 :
 :Your Honor's players, hearing your amendment,
 :
 :Are come to play a pleasant comedy,
 :
 :For so your doctors hold it very meet,
 :Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your
 :blood,
 :And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.
 :Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
S:And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
 :
 :Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  Marry, I will. Let them play it.	[Messenger exits.]
 :Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling
 :trick?
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]
S:No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
 :
 :
 :
S:SLY  What, household stuff?
 :
 :
 :
S:PAGE, [as Lady]  It is a kind of history.
 :
 :
 :
 :SLY  Well, we'll see 't. Come, madam wife, sit by my
 :
 :side, and let the world slip. We shall ne'er be
 :younger.
 :[They sit.]

 :LUCENTIO
S:
 :Tranio, since for the great desire I had
 :
 :To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
 :
 :I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
 :
S:The pleasant garden of great Italy,
 :
 :And by my father's love and leave am armed
 :
 :With his goodwill and thy good company.
 :
 :My trusty servant well approved in all,
S:Here let us breathe and haply institute
 :
 :A course of learning and ingenious studies.
 :
 :Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
 :
 :Gave me my being, and my father first,
S:A merchant of great traffic through the world,
 :
 :Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
 :
 :Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
 :
 :It shall become to serve all hopes conceived
 :To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
 :And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study
 :Virtue, and that part of philosophy
 :Will I apply that treats of happiness
 :By virtue specially to be achieved.
S:
 :Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left
 :
 :And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
 :
S:A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
 :
 :And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Mi perdonato, gentle master mine.
 :I am in all affected as yourself,
 :Glad that you thus continue your resolve
 :To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
 :Only, good master, while we do admire
S:
 :This virtue and this moral discipline,
 :
 :Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
 :
 :Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
 :
 :As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.
 :Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
 :And practice rhetoric in your common talk;
 :Music and poesy use to quicken you;
 :The mathematics and the metaphysics--
S:
S:Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
 :
 :No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en.
 :
 :In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
 :
 :

 :Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
 :If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,

 :
 :And take a lodging fit to entertain
 :
 :Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.

 :BAPTISTA, [to Gremio and Hortensio]
 :Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
 :For how I firmly am resolved you know:
S:
 :That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
 :
 :Before I have a husband for the elder.
 :
 :If either of you both love Katherine,

 :Because I know you well and love you well,
 :Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

 :Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.
 :
 :Iwis it is not halfway to her heart.
 :
 :But if it were, doubt not her care should be
S:To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool
 :
 :And paint your face and use you like a fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!
S:
 :
 :GREMIO  And me too, good Lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [aside to Lucentio]
S:Husht, master, here's some good pastime toward;
 :
S:That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [aside to Tranio]
 :
 :But in the other's silence do I see
 :Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
 :Peace, Tranio.
 :
S:TRANIO, [aside to Lucentio]
 :
 :Well said, master. Mum, and gaze your fill.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA, [to Gremio and Hortensio]
S:Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
 :
 :What I have said--Bianca, get you in,
 :
 :And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
 :
 :For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :A pretty peat! It is best
 :
 :Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Sister, content you in my discontent.--
 :Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.
 :My books and instruments shall be my company,
S:
 :On them to look and practice by myself.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [aside to Tranio]
 :
 :Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
S:Sorry am I that our goodwill effects
 :
 :Bianca's grief.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Why will you mew her up,
 :Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
 :And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:Gentlemen, content you. I am resolved.--
 :
 :Go in, Bianca.	[Bianca exits.]
 :
 :And for I know she taketh most delight
 :
 :In music, instruments, and poetry,
S:Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
 :
 :Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
 :
 :Or, Signior Gremio, you know any such,
 :
 :Prefer them hither. For to cunning men
 :I will be very kind, and liberal
 :To mine own children in good bringing up.
 :And so, farewell.--Katherine, you may stay,
 :For I have more to commune with Bianca.	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
 :
 :What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike,
 :
 :I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!
 :[She exits.]
 :
 :GREMIO  You may go to the Devil's dam! Your gifts are
 :so good here's none will hold you.--Their love is
S:
 :not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
 :
 :together and fast it fairly out. Our cake's dough on
 :
 :both sides. Farewell. Yet for the love I bear my
 :
 :sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
 :man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
 :wish him to her father.
 :
 :HORTENSIO  So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I
S:
 :pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never
 :
 :brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth
 :
 :us both (that we may yet again have access to our
 :
 :fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love) to
 :labor and effect one thing specially.
 :
 :GREMIO  What's that, I pray?
 :
S:
 :HORTENSIO  Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  A husband? A devil!
 :
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO  I say "a husband."
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  I say "a devil." Think'st thou, Hortensio,
 :though her father be very rich, any man is so very a
 :fool to be married to hell?
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO  Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience
 :
 :and mine to endure her loud alarums, why,
 :
S:man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man
 :
 :could light on them, would take her with all faults,
 :
 :and money enough.
 :
S:
 :
 :GREMIO  I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry
 :
 :with this condition: to be whipped at the high cross
 :
 :every morning.
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO  Faith, as you say, there's small choice in
 :
 :rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law
 :
 :makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
S:maintained till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
 :
 :to a husband we set his youngest free for a
 :
 :husband, and then have to 't afresh. Sweet Bianca!
 :
 :Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the
 :ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?
 :
 :GREMIO  I am agreed, and would I had given him the
 :best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
 :thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid
S:
 :the house of her. Come on.
 :
 :[Gremio and Hortensio exit.
 :
S:Tranio and Lucentio remain onstage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
 :That love should of a sudden take such hold?
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
 :
 :I never thought it possible or likely.
 :But see, while idly I stood looking on,
 :I found the effect of love-in-idleness,
 :And now in plainness do confess to thee
 :That art to me as secret and as dear
S:As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was:
 :
 :Tranio, I burn, I pine! I perish, Tranio,
 :
 :If I achieve not this young modest girl.
 :
 :Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst.
 :Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Master, it is no time to chide you now.
 :Affection is not rated from the heart.
S:
 :If love have touched you, naught remains but so:
 :
S:Redime te captum quam queas minimo.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCENTIO
 :
 :Gramercies, lad. Go forward. This contents;
 :
 :The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Master, you looked so longly on the maid,
 :Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all.
 :
 :LUCENTIO
S:
 :O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
 :
 :Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
 :
 :That made great Jove to humble him to her hand
 :
 :When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister
S:Began to scold and raise up such a storm
 :
 :That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
 :And with her breath she did perfume the air.
 :Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
 :
 :TRANIO, [aside]
S:
 :Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.--
 :
 :I pray, awake, sir! If you love the maid,
 :
 :Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it
 :
 :stands:
 :Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
 :That till the father rid his hands of her,
 :Master, your love must live a maid at home,
 :And therefore has he closely mewed her up,
S:
 :Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
 :But art thou not advised he took some care
 :To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
 :
 :TRANIO
S:
 :Ay, marry, am I, sir--and now 'tis plotted!
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
S:I have it, Tranio!
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO  Master, for my hand,
 :
 :Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Tell me thine first.
 :
S:TRANIO  You will be schoolmaster
 :
 :And undertake the teaching of the maid:
 :
 :That's your device.
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  It is. May it be done?
 :
S:TRANIO
 :
 :Not possible. For who shall bear your part
 :
S:And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
 :
 :Keep house, and ply his book, welcome his friends,
 :
 :Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
 :We have not yet been seen in any house,
 :Nor can we be distinguished by our faces
 :For man or master. Then it follows thus:
S:
 :Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
 :
 :Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should.
 :
 :I will some other be, some Florentine,
 :
S:Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
 :
 :'Tis hatched, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
 :
 :Uncase thee. Take my colored hat and cloak.
 :
 :[They exchange clothes.]
S:When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,
 :
 :But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO  So had you need.
 :In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
 :And I am tied to be obedient
 :(For so your father charged me at our parting:
 :"Be serviceable to my son," quoth he,
S:Although I think 'twas in another sense),
 :
 :I am content to be Lucentio,
 :
 :Because so well I love Lucentio.
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,
 :And let me be a slave, t' achieve that maid
 :Whose sudden sight hath thralled my wounded eye.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Here comes the rogue.--Sirrah, where have you
 :
 :been?
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :Where have I been? Nay, how now, where are you?
S:Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?
 :
 :Or you stolen his? Or both? Pray, what's the news?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Sirrah, come hither. 'Tis no time to jest,
 :And therefore frame your manners to the time.
S:Your fellow, Tranio here, to save my life,
 :
S:Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
 :
S:And I for my escape have put on his;
 :
 :For in a quarrel since I came ashore
 :
S:I killed a man and fear I was descried.
 :
 :Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
 :
 :While I make way from hence to save my life.
 :
 :You understand me?
 :
S:BIONDELLO  Ay, sir. [Aside.] Ne'er a whit.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
S:And not a jot of "Tranio" in your mouth.
 :
 :Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :The better for him. Would I were so too.
 :
 :TRANIO
S:So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
 :
 :That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest
 :
 :daughter.
 :
 :But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I
 :advise
 :You use your manners discreetly in all kind of
 :companies.
 :When I am alone, why then I am Tranio;
 :But in all places else, your master Lucentio.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Tranio, let's go. One thing more rests, that
 :
 :thyself execute, to make one among these wooers. If
 :
 :thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both
 :good and weighty.	[They exit.]
 :[The Presenters above speak.]
S:
 :
 :FIRST SERVINGMAN
 :
 :My lord, you nod. You do not mind the play.
 :
 :
 :SLY  Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely.
 :Comes there any more of it?
 :
 :PAGE, [as Lady]  My lord, 'tis but begun.
 :
S:
 :SLY  'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.
 :
 :Would 'twere done.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
S:[Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Verona, for a while I take my leave
S:To see my friends in Padua, but of all
 :
 :My best beloved and approved friend,
 :
 :Hortensio. And I trow this is his house.
 :
 :Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
 :
 :GRUMIO  Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there
 :any man has rebused your Worship?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
S:
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir,
 :
 :that I should knock you here, sir?
 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
 :
 :And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
S:
 :
S:GRUMIO
 :
S:My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
 :
 :you first,
 :
 :And then I know after who comes by the worst.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Will it not be?
 :Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it.
S:I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
 :
 :[He wrings him by the ears. Grumio falls.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Help, mistress, help! My master is mad.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Now knock when I bid you, sirrah
 :villain.
 :
 :[Enter Hortensio.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO  How now, what's the matter? My old
 :
S:friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio? How
 :
 :do you all at Verona?
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
 :Con tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.
 :
 :HORTENSIO  Alia nostra casa ben venuto, molto
 :honorato signor mio Petruchio.--Rise, Grumio,
S:
 :rise. We will compound this quarrel.	[Grumio rises.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in
 :
S:Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave
 :
 :his service--look you, sir: he bid me knock him
 :
 :and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a
 :
 :servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for
 :aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?
 :Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first,
 :Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :A senseless villain, good Hortensio.
 :
 :I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
 :
S:And could not get him for my heart to do it.
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  Knock at the gate? O, heavens, spake you not
 :
 :these words plain: "Sirrah, knock me here, rap me
 :
 :here, knock me well, and knock me soundly"? And
 :come you now with "knocking at the gate"?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Sirrah, begone, or talk not, I advise you.
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio's pledge.
 :
 :Why, this' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
S:Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
 :
 :And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
 :
 :Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Such wind as scatters young men through the world
 :To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
 :Where small experience grows. But in a few,
 :Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
S:
 :Antonio, my father, is deceased,
 :
 :And I have thrust myself into this maze,
 :
 :Happily to wive and thrive, as best I may.
 :
 :Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
 :And so am come abroad to see the world.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
 :
 :And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favored wife?
 :
 :Thou 'dst thank me but a little for my counsel--
 :
 :And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
 :And very rich. But thou 'rt too much my friend,
 :And I'll not wish thee to her.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
S:
 :Few words suffice. And therefore, if thou know
 :
 :One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife
 :
 :(As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),
 :
S:Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
 :
 :As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
 :
 :As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
 :
 :She moves me not, or not removes at least
 :Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
 :As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
 :I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
 :If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO, [to Hortensio]  Nay, look you, sir, he tells you
 :
 :flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough
 :
 :and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an
 :
 :old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she
 :have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses. Why,
 :nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:
 :Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in,
 :
 :I will continue that I broached in jest.
 :
 :I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
 :
S:With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
 :
 :Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.
 :
S:Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
 :
S:Is that she is intolerable curst,
 :
 :And shrewd, and froward, so beyond all measure
 :
 :That, were my state far worser than it is,
 :
 :I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Hortensio, peace. Thou know'st not gold's effect.
 :Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
 :For I will board her, though she chide as loud
S:
 :As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :Her father is Baptista Minola,
 :An affable and courteous gentleman.
 :Her name is Katherina Minola,
 :Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :I know her father, though I know not her,
 :
 :And he knew my deceased father well.
 :
 :I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,
S:And therefore let me be thus bold with you
 :
S:To give you over at this first encounter--
 :
 :Unless you will accompany me thither.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO, [to Hortensio]  I pray you, sir, let him go while
 :the humor lasts. O' my word, an she knew him as
 :well as I do, she would think scolding would do little
 :good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
 :score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; an he begin
 :once, he'll rail in his rope tricks. I'll tell you what,
S:
 :sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a
 :
 :figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that
 :
 :she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
 :
 :You know him not, sir.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Tarry, Petruchio. I must go with thee,
 :For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
S:
 :He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
 :
 :His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
 :
S:And her withholds from me and other more,
 :
 :Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
 :
 :Supposing it a thing impossible,
 :
 :For those defects I have before rehearsed,
S:That ever Katherina will be wooed.
 :
 :Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
 :
S:That none shall have access unto Bianca
 :
 :Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  "Katherine the curst,"
 :A title for a maid, of all titles the worst.
 :
S:HORTENSIO
 :
 :Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
 :
 :And offer me disguised in sober robes
 :
 :To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
S:Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,
 :
 :That so I may, by this device at least,
 :
 :Have leave and leisure to make love to her
 :
 :And unsuspected court her by herself.
 :
S:GRUMIO  Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old
 :
 :folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Gremio and Lucentio, disguised as Cambio, a
 :
 :schoolmaster.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love.
 :
 :Petruchio, stand by awhile.
 :[Petruchio, Hortensio, and Grumio stand aside.]
 :
 :GRUMIO, [aside]
 :A proper stripling, and an amorous.
 :
S:
 :GREMIO, [to Lucentio]
 :
 :O, very well, I have perused the note.
 :
 :Hark you, sir, I'll have them very fairly bound,
 :
S:All books of love. See that at any hand,
 :
 :And see you read no other lectures to her.
 :
 :You understand me. Over and beside
 :
S:Signior Baptista's liberality,
 :
 :I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too.
 :
 :And let me have them very well perfumed,
 :
 :For she is sweeter than perfume itself
S:To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :
 :Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
 :As for my patron, stand you so assured,
S:As firmly as yourself were still in place,
 :
 :Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
 :
 :Than you--unless you were a scholar, sir.
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :O this learning, what a thing it is!
 :
 :GRUMIO, [aside]
S:O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [aside]  Peace, sirrah.
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO, [aside]
 :
 :Grumio, mum.	[Coming forward.]
 :
 :God save you, Signior Gremio.
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
 :Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
 :I promised to enquire carefully
S:About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,
 :
 :And by good fortune I have lighted well
 :
 :On this young man, for learning and behavior
 :
 :Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
 :And other books--good ones, I warrant you.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :'Tis well. And I have met a gentleman
 :Hath promised me to help me to another,
S:
 :A fine musician to instruct our mistress.
 :
 :So shall I no whit be behind in duty
 :
 :To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
 :
S:
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
S:Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO, [aside]  And that his bags shall prove.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
 :
 :Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
 :
 :I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
 :
 :[Presenting Petruchio.]
 :Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
S:Upon agreement from us to his liking,
 :
 :Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,
 :
S:Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  So said, so done, is well.
 :
 :Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:I know she is an irksome, brawling scold.
 :
 :If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :No? Sayst me so, friend? What countryman?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
S:My father dead, my fortune lives for me,
 :
 :And I do hope good days and long to see.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Oh, sir, such a life with such a wife were strange.
 :But if you have a stomach, to 't, i' God's name!
 :You shall have me assisting you in all.
 :But will you woo this wildcat?
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO  Will I live?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :
S:Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Why came I hither but to that intent?
S:Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
 :
 :Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
 :
 :Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,
 :
 :Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
 :Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
 :And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
 :Have I not in a pitched battle heard
 :Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?
S:And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
 :
 :That gives not half so great a blow to hear
 :
 :As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
 :
 :Tush, tush, fear boys with bugs!
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  For he fears none.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Hortensio, hark.
 :This gentleman is happily arrived,
 :My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
S:I promised we would be contributors
 :
 :And bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
S:And so we will, provided that he win her.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :
 :I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Tranio, disguised as Lucentio, and Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
 :
 :Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
 :
 :To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  He that has the two fair daughters--is 't
 :he you mean?
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Even he, Biondello.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Perhaps him and her, sir. What have you to do?
S:
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
 :
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [aside]
 :
 :Well begun, Tranio.
 :
 :HORTENSIO  Sir, a word ere you go.
S:Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :An if I be, sir, is it any offense?
S:
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :No, if without more words you will get you hence.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Why sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
S:For me, as for you?
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  But so is not she.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :For what reason, I beseech you?
 :
 :GREMIO
 :For this reason, if you'll know:
S:
 :That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,
 :Do me this right: hear me with patience.
S:
 :Baptista is a noble gentleman
 :
 :To whom my father is not all unknown,
 :
 :And were his daughter fairer than she is,
 :
 :She may more suitors have, and me for one.
 :Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers.
 :Then well one more may fair Bianca have.
 :And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,
 :Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
S:
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :
 :Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [to Tranio]
 :Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
S:
 :Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,
 :The one as famous for a scolding tongue
S:As is the other for beauteous modesty.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
S:Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,
 :And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [to Tranio]
 :Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
 :The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
S:
 :Her father keeps from all access of suitors
 :
 :And will not promise her to any man
 :
 :Until the elder sister first be wed.
 :
 :The younger then is free, and not before.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :If it be so, sir, that you are the man
 :Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest,
S:
 :And if you break the ice and do this feat,
 :
S:Achieve the elder, set the younger free
 :
 :For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
 :
 :Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive.
 :And since you do profess to be a suitor,
 :You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
 :To whom we all rest generally beholding.
S:
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
 :
 :Please you we may contrive this afternoon
 :And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
 :And do as adversaries do in law,
S:Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO and BIONDELLO
 :
 :O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:The motion's good indeed, and be it so.--
 :
 :Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

S:Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Katherine and Bianca with her hands tied.]
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :BIANCA
 :
S:Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
 :
 :To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.
 :
 :That I disdain. But for these other goods--
 :
 :Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
 :Yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,
 :Or what you will command me will I do,
 :So well I know my duty to my elders.
 :
 :KATHERINE
S:
 :Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
 :
 :Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
 :I never yet beheld that special face
 :Which I could fancy more than any other.
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Minion, thou liest. Is 't not Hortensio?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :If you affect him, sister, here I swear
S:I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :O, then belike you fancy riches more.
 :You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
 :
S:BIANCA
 :
 :Is it for him you do envy me so?
 :
 :Nay, then, you jest, and now I well perceive
 :
 :You have but jested with me all this while.
 :I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
 :[Katherine strikes her.]
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Baptista.]
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:Why, how now, dame, whence grows this
 :
 :insolence?--
 :
 :Bianca, stand aside.--Poor girl, she weeps!
 :
 :[He unties her hands.]
 :[To Bianca.] Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
 :[To Katherine.] For shame, thou hilding of a devilish
 :spirit!
 :Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong
 :thee?
S:
 :When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged!
 :
S:[She flies after Bianca.]
 :
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA
 :
 :What, in my sight?--Bianca, get thee in.
 :
 :[Bianca exits.]
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
 :She is your treasure, she must have a husband,
 :I must dance barefoot on her wedding day
 :And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell.
S:
 :Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep
 :
 :Till I can find occasion of revenge.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
 :
 :But who comes here?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Gremio; Lucentio disguised as Cambio
S:in the habit of a mean man; Petruchio with
 :
 :Hortensio disguised as Litio; and Tranio disguised
 :
 :as Lucentio, with his boy, Biondello bearing a lute
 :
S:and books.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.
 :
S:BAPTISTA  Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.--God
 :
 :save you, gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter
 :Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.
 :
S:
 :
S:GREMIO, [to Petruchio]
 :
 :You are too blunt. Go to it orderly.
 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :You wrong me, Signior Gremio. Give me leave.--
 :
S:I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
 :
S:That hearing of her beauty and her wit,
 :
 :Her affability and bashful modesty,
 :
 :Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
 :
 :Am bold to show myself a forward guest
 :Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
 :Of that report which I so oft have heard,
 :And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
S:I do present you with a man of mine,
 :
 :[Presenting Hortensio, disguised as Litio]
 :
 :Cunning in music and the mathematics,
 :
 :To instruct her fully in those sciences,
S:Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
 :
 :Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.
 :
 :His name is Litio, born in Mantua.
 :
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :You're welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.
 :
 :But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
 :She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:I see you do not mean to part with her,
 :
 :Or else you like not of my company.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA
 :
 :Mistake me not. I speak but as I find.
 :
 :Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
 :
 :A man well known throughout all Italy.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA
 :
 :I know him well. You are welcome for his sake.
 :
S:
 :
S:GREMIO
 :
 :Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray
 :
 :Let us that are poor petitioners speak too!
 :
 :Bacare, you are marvelous forward.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be
 :doing.
 :
S:
 :GREMIO
 :
 :I doubt it not, sir. But you will curse your wooing.
 :
 :[To Baptista.] Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful,
 :
 :I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
S:that have been more kindly beholding to you than
 :
S:any, freely give unto you this young scholar [presenting
 :
 :Lucentio, disguised as Cambio] that hath
 :
 :been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek,
 :
S:Latin, and other languages as the other in music and
 :
 :mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept his
 :
 :service.
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA  A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.--Welcome,
 :
 :good Cambio. [To Tranio as Lucentio.] But,
 :
 :gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I
 :
 :be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
 :That being a stranger in this city here
 :Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
S:
 :Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
 :
 :Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
 :
 :In the preferment of the eldest sister.
 :
S:This liberty is all that I request,
 :
 :That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
 :
 :I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
 :
 :And free access and favor as the rest.
 :And toward the education of your daughters
 :I here bestow a simple instrument
 :And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
 :[Biondello comes forward with the gifts.]
S:If you accept them, then their worth is great.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
S:Lucentio is your name. Of whence, I pray?
 :
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :A mighty man of Pisa. By report
 :I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
 :[To Hortensio as Litio.] Take you the lute,
S:[To Lucentio as Cambio.] and you the set of books.
 :
 :You shall go see your pupils presently.
 :
 :Holla, within!
 :
 :
S:[Enter a Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
 :
 :To my daughters, and tell them both
 :These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
 :[Servant exits with Hortensio and Lucentio.]
S:We will go walk a little in the orchard,
 :
 :And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
 :
 :And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
S:And every day I cannot come to woo.
 :
 :You knew my father well, and in him me,
 :
 :Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
 :
 :Which I have bettered rather than decreased.
 :Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
 :What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :After my death, the one half of my lands,
S:
 :And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
 :Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
 :In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
 :Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
 :That covenants may be kept on either hand.
S:
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,
 :
 :That is, her love, for that is all in all.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Why, that is nothing. For I tell you, father,
S:I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
 :
S:And where two raging fires meet together,
 :
 :They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
 :
 :Though little fire grows great with little wind,
 :
 :Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
 :So I to her and so she yields to me,
 :For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.
S:
 :But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
 :
S:
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
 :
 :That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Hortensio as Litio with his head broke.]
 :
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
S:How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
 :
 :For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
 :
S:HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
 :
 :I think she'll sooner prove a soldier!
 :
 :Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
S:Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.
 :
 :I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
 :
 :And bowed her hand to teach her fingering,
 :
 :When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
 :" 'Frets' call you these?" quoth she. "I'll fume with
 :them!"
 :And with that word she struck me on the head,
 :And through the instrument my pate made way,
 :And there I stood amazed for a while,
S:
 :As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
 :
S:While she did call me "rascal fiddler,"
 :
 :And "twangling Jack," with twenty such vile terms,
 :
 :As had she studied to misuse me so.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
 :I love her ten times more than ere I did.
 :O, how I long to have some chat with her!
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA, [to Hortensio as Litio]
 :
S:Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited.
 :
 :Proceed in practice with my younger daughter.
 :
 :She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.--
 :
 :Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
 :Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :I pray you do. I'll attend her here--
 :
 :[All but Petruchio exit.]
 :And woo her with some spirit when she comes!
 :Say that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain
 :She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
 :Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
 :As morning roses newly washed with dew.
S:
 :Say she be mute and will not speak a word,
 :
 :Then I'll commend her volubility
 :
 :And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
 :
 :If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks
 :As though she bid me stay by her a week.
 :If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
S:When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
 :
 :But here she comes--and now, Petruchio, speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Katherine.]
 :
 :Good morrow, Kate, for that's your name, I hear.
 :
 :KATHERINE
S:Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.
 :
 :They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate,
 :And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst.
 :But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
 :Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate
 :(For dainties are all Kates)--and therefore, Kate,
S:
 :Take this of me, Kate of my consolation:
 :
 :Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
 :
 :Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded
 :
S:(Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs),
 :
 :Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :"Moved," in good time! Let him that moved you
 :hither
 :Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
S:You were a movable.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Why, what's a movable?
 :
S:KATHERINE  A joint stool.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Women are made to bear, and so are you.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
S:No such jade as you, if me you mean.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee,
 :For knowing thee to be but young and light--
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Too light for such a swain as you to catch,
 :And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :"Should be"--should buzz!
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  Well ta'en, and like a
 :buzzard.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :O slow-winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Come, come, you wasp! I' faith, you are too angry.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :My remedy is then to pluck it out.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
 :
S:In his tail.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  In his tongue.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Whose tongue?
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Yours, if you talk of tales, and so farewell.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  What, with my tongue in your tail?
 :
 :Nay, come again, good Kate. I am a gentleman--
 :
 :
S:KATHERINE  That I'll try.	[She strikes him.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.
 :
 :KATHERINE  So may you lose your arms.
 :If you strike me, you are no gentleman,
 :And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books.
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  What is your crest? A coxcomb?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE
 :
S:No cock of mine. You crow too like a craven.
 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Nay, come, Kate, come. You must not look so sour.
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :It is my fashion when I see a crab.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.
S:
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  There is, there is.
 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
S:Then show it me.
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE  Had I a glass, I would.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  What, you mean my face?
 :
 :KATHERINE  Well aimed of such a young one.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
S:
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Yet you are withered.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  'Tis with cares.
S:
 :
S:KATHERINE  I care not.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Nay, hear you, Kate--in sooth, you 'scape not so.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :I chafe you if I tarry. Let me go.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle.
S:'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
 :
 :And now I find report a very liar.
 :
S:For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing
 :
 :courteous,
 :
 :But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
 :
 :Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
 :Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,
 :Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.
 :But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
 :With gentle conference, soft, and affable.
S:Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
 :
 :O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel twig
 :
 :Is straight, and slender, and as brown in hue
 :
 :As hazelnuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
S:O, let me see thee walk! Thou dost not halt.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Did ever Dian so become a grove
 :As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
 :O, be thou Dian and let her be Kate,
S:
 :And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Where did you study all this goodly speech?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :It is extempore, from my mother wit.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :A witty mother, witless else her son.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Am I not wise?
 :
 :KATHERINE  Yes, keep you warm.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
 :
 :And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
 :
 :Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
 :
 :That you shall be my wife, your dowry 'greed on,
 :And, will you, nill you, I will marry you.
S:Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,
 :
 :For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
 :
 :Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
 :
 :Thou must be married to no man but me.
 :For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
 :And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
S:Conformable as other household Kates.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Baptista, Gremio, and Tranio as Lucentio.]
 :
 :
S:Here comes your father. Never make denial.
 :
 :I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my
 :daughter?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  How but well, sir? How but well?
S:It were impossible I should speed amiss.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :Why, how now, daughter Katherine? In your
 :dumps?
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
S:You have showed a tender fatherly regard,
 :
 :To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
 :
 :A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
 :
 :That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
 :
 :That talked of her have talked amiss of her.
 :If she be curst, it is for policy,
 :For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
 :She is not hot, but temperate as the morn.
 :For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
 :And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
S:
 :And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
 :
 :That upon Sunday is the wedding day.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
 :
 :GREMIO  Hark, Petruchio, she says she'll see thee
S:hanged first.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Is this your speeding? Nay,
 :
 :then, goodnight our part.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself.
 :
 :If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
 :'Tis bargained 'twixt us twain, being alone,
 :That she shall still be curst in company.
 :I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
 :How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate!
 :She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
S:
 :She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
 :
 :That in a twink she won me to her love.
 :
 :O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see
 :
 :How tame, when men and women are alone,
 :A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.--
 :Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice
 :To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day.--
 :Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.
S:
 :I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :I know not what to say, but give me your hands.
 :God send you joy, Petruchio. 'Tis a match.
 :
 :GREMIO and TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Amen, say we. We will be witnesses.
S:
 :
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
 :
 :I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace.
 :
 :We will have rings, and things, and fine array,
 :And kiss me, Kate. We will be married o' Sunday.
S:[Petruchio and Katherine exit
 :
 :through different doors.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part
 :And venture madly on a desperate mart.
S:
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.
 :
 :'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :The gain I seek, is quiet in the match.
 :
S:
S:GREMIO
 :
 :No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
 :
 :But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.
 :
 :Now is the day we long have looked for.
S:I am your neighbor and was suitor first.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :And I am one that love Bianca more
 :Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
 :
S:
 :
 :GREMIO  But thine doth fry!
 :
 :Skipper, stand back. 'Tis age that nourisheth.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Content you, gentlemen. I will compound this strife.
S:
 :'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
 :
 :That can assure my daughter greatest dower
 :
 :Shall have my Bianca's love.
 :
 :Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
S:
 :
S:GREMIO
 :
 :First, as you know, my house within the city
 :
 :Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
 :
 :Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
 :My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
 :In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns,
 :In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
 :Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
 :Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl,
S:
 :Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
 :
 :Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
 :
S:To house or housekeeping. Then, at my farm
 :
 :I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
 :
 :Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
 :
 :And all things answerable to this portion.
 :Myself am struck in years, I must confess,
 :And if I die tomorrow this is hers,
S:If whilst I live she will be only mine.
 :
 :
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :That "only" came well in. [To Baptista.] Sir, list to
 :
 :me:
 :
 :I am my father's heir and only son.
 :If I may have your daughter to my wife,
 :I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
 :Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
 :Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,
 :Besides two thousand ducats by the year
S:
 :Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.--
 :
 :What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio?
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Two thousand ducats by the year of land?
 :[Aside.] My land amounts not to so much in all.--
 :That she shall have, besides an argosy
S:That now is lying in Marcellus' road.
 :
 :[To Tranio.] What, have I choked you with an argosy?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
 :
 :Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses
 :
 :And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
 :
 :And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Nay, I have offered all. I have no more,
 :And she can have no more than all I have.
 :[To Baptista.] If you like me, she shall have me and
S:
 :mine.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:Why, then, the maid is mine from all the world,
 :
 :By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :I must confess your offer is the best,
 :And, let your father make her the assurance,
 :She is your own; else, you must pardon me.
 :If you should die before him, where's her dower?
 :
S:
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :That's but a cavil. He is old, I young.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :And may not young men die as well as old?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved:
S:
 :On Sunday next, you know
 :
 :My daughter Katherine is to be married.
 :
 :[To Tranio as Lucentio.] Now, on the Sunday
 :
 :following, shall Bianca
 :Be bride to you, if you make this assurance.
 :If not, to Signior Gremio.
 :And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
 :
S:
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Adieu, good neighbor.	[Baptista exits.]
 :
 :Now I fear thee not.
 :
S:Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
 :
 :To give thee all and in his waning age
 :
 :Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
 :
 :An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
S:[Gremio exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!--
 :Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
 :'Tis in my head to do my master good.
S:I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
 :
 :Must get a father, called "supposed Vincentio"--
 :
 :And that's a wonder. Fathers commonly
 :
 :Do get their children. But in this case of wooing,
 :A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
 :[He exits.]

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Lucentio as Cambio, Hortensio as Litio, and
 :Bianca.]
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :Fiddler, forbear. You grow too forward, sir.
S:
 :Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
 :
 :Her sister Katherine welcomed you withal?
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]  But, wrangling pedant, this is
 :The patroness of heavenly harmony.
 :Then give me leave to have prerogative,
 :And when in music we have spent an hour,
 :Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :
 :Preposterous ass, that never read so far
 :
 :To know the cause why music was ordained.
 :Was it not to refresh the mind of man
 :After his studies or his usual pain?
 :Then give me leave to read philosophy,
 :And, while I pause, serve in your harmony.
S:
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
 :
 :Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
 :To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
S:I am no breeching scholar in the schools.
 :
 :I'll not be tied to hours, nor 'pointed times,
 :
 :But learn my lessons as I please myself.
 :
 :And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down.
 :[To Hortensio.] Take you your instrument, play you
 :the whiles;
 :His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
S:
 :You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [aside]
 :
 :That will be never. [To Hortensio.] Tune your
 :instrument.	[Hortensio steps aside to tune his lute.]
 :
 :BIANCA  Where left we last?
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]  Here, madam:
 :
S:[Showing her a book.]
 :
 :Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
 :
 :Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.
 :
 :
 :BIANCA  Conster them.
 :
S:LUCENTIO  Hic ibat, as I told you before, Simois, I am
 :
 :Lucentio, hic est, son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
 :
 :Sigeia tellus, disguised thus to get your love, Hic
 :
 :steterat, and that "Lucentio" that comes a-wooing,
 :Priami, is my man Tranio, regia, bearing my port,
 :celsa senis, that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]  Madam, my instrument's in
 :
 :tune.
 :
 :
 :BIANCA  Let's hear. [He plays.] Oh fie, the treble jars!
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]  Spit in the hole, man, and tune
 :again.	[Hortensio tunes his lute again.]
 :
S:
 :BIANCA  Now let me see if I can conster it. Hic ibat
 :
S:Simois, I know you not; hic est Sigeia tellus, I trust
 :
 :you not; Hic steterat Priami, take heed he hear us
 :
S:not; regia, presume not; celsa senis, despair not.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
 :
 :Madam, 'tis now in tune.	[He plays again.]
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]  All but the bass.
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
 :
 :The bass is right. 'Tis the base knave that jars.
 :
 :[Aside.] How fiery and forward our pedant is.
 :Now for my life the knave doth court my love!
 :Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
 :
 :BIANCA, [to Lucentio]
 :In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :Mistrust it not, for sure Aeacides
 :
 :Was Ajax, called so from his grandfather.
 :
 :BIANCA
 :I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
 :I should be arguing still upon that doubt.
S:
 :But let it rest.--Now, Litio, to you.
 :
 :Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
 :
 :That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio, to Lucentio]
 :You may go walk, and give me leave awhile.
 :My lessons make no music in three parts.
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :
 :Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait
 :
 :[Aside.] And watch withal, for, but I be deceived,
S:Our fine musician groweth amorous.
 :
 :[He steps aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [as Litio]
S:Madam, before you touch the instrument,
 :
 :To learn the order of my fingering
 :
 :I must begin with rudiments of art,
 :
 :To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
S:More pleasant, pithy, and effectual
 :
 :Than hath been taught by any of my trade.
 :
S:And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
 :
 :
 :
S:BIANCA
 :
 :Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
S:[Giving her a paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA [reads]
 :
S:"Gamut I am, the ground of all accord:
 :
 :A re, to plead Hortensio's passion;
 :
S:B mi, Bianca, take him for thy lord,
 :
 :C fa ut, that loves with all affection;
 :
 :D sol re, one clef, two notes have I;
 :
 :E la mi, show pity or I die."
 :Call you this "gamut"? Tut, I like it not.
 :Old fashions please me best. I am not so nice
 :To change true rules for odd inventions.
 :
 :[Enter a Servant.]
S:
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :SERVANT
 :
 :Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
S:And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
 :
 :You know tomorrow is the wedding day.
 :
 :
 :
S:BIANCA
 :
 :Farewell, sweet masters both. I must be gone.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
 :[Bianca, the Servant, and Lucentio exit.]
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :But I have cause to pry into this pedant.
S:
 :Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
 :
S:Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
 :
 :To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale,
 :
 :Seize thee that list! If once I find thee ranging,
 :
 :Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

 :Scene 2
 :=======
S:[Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio as Lucentio, Katherine,
 :
 :Bianca, Lucentio as Cambio, and others, Attendants.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA, [to Tranio]
 :
 :Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
 :
S:That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
 :
 :And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
 :
 :What will be said? What mockery will it be,
 :
 :To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
 :To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?
 :What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :No shame but mine. I must, forsooth, be forced
 :
 :To give my hand, opposed against my heart,
 :Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
 :Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure.
 :I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
 :Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior,
 :And, to be noted for a merry man,
S:
 :He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
 :
 :Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns,
 :
 :Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.
 :
 :Now must the world point at poor Katherine
 :And say "Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
S:If it would please him come and marry her."
 :
 :
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
 :
 :Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
 :
 :Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
 :Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
 :Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
 :
 :KATHERINE
S:Would Katherine had never seen him, though!
 :
 :[She exits weeping.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Go, girl. I cannot blame thee now to weep,
S:For such an injury would vex a very saint,
 :
S:Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Master, master, news! And such old
 :news as you never heard of!
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Is it new and old too? How may that be?
 :
S:
 :BIONDELLO  Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's
 :
 :coming?
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Is he come?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Why, no, sir.
 :
S:BAPTISTA
 :
 :What then?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  He is coming.
 :
 :BAPTISTA  When will he be here?
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :When he stands where I am, and sees you there.
S:
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  But say, what to thine old news?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and
 :an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned,
 :a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one
 :buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en
S:out of the town armory, with a broken hilt, and
 :
 :chapeless; with two broken points; his horse
 :
S:hipped, with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no
 :
 :kindred, besides possessed with the glanders and
 :
S:like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass,
 :
 :infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,
 :
 :sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure
 :
 :of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn
 :with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,
 :near-legged before, and with a half-checked
 :bit and a headstall of sheep's leather,
 :which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling,
 :hath been often burst, and now repaired with
S:
 :knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman's
 :
 :crupper of velour, which hath two letters for her
 :
 :name fairly set down in studs, and here and there
 :
 :pieced with packthread.
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Who comes with him?
 :
S:BIONDELLO  Oh, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisone
S:d
 :
 :like the horse: with a linen stock on one leg
 :
 :and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with
 :
 :a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humor of
 :forty fancies pricked in 't for a feather. A monster,
 :a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
 :footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:
 :'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,
 :
 :Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-appareled.
 :
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA
 :
 :I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Why, sir, he comes not.
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Didst thou not say he comes?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Who? That Petruchio came?
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Ay, that Petruchio came!
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  No, sir, I say his horse comes with him on
 :his back.
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Why, that's all one.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :Nay, by Saint Jamy.
S:I hold you a penny,
 :
 :A horse and a man
 :
S:Is more than one,
 :
 :And yet not many.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Petruchio and Grumio.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
 :
 :BAPTISTA  You are welcome, sir.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  And yet I come not well.
 :
S:
 :BAPTISTA  And yet you halt not.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Not so well appareled as I wish
 :
 :you were.
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Were it better I should rush in thus--
 :
 :But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
 :
 :How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown.
 :And wherefore gaze this goodly company
 :As if they saw some wondrous monument,
 :Some comet or unusual prodigy?
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:
 :Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.
 :
S:First were we sad, fearing you would not come,
 :
 :Now sadder that you come so unprovided.
 :
 :Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
 :
 :An eyesore to our solemn festival.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :And tell us what occasion of import
 :Hath all so long detained you from your wife
S:And sent you hither so unlike yourself.
 :
S:
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear.
 :
 :Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
 :
 :Though in some part enforced to digress,
 :Which at more leisure I will so excuse
 :As you shall well be satisfied with all.
 :But where is Kate? I stay too long from her.
 :The morning wears. 'Tis time we were at church.
 :
S:
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:See not your bride in these unreverent robes.
 :
 :Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:Not I, believe me. Thus I'll visit her.
 :
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Good sooth, even thus. Therefore, ha' done with
 :words.
 :To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
 :Could I repair what she will wear in me,
S:
 :As I can change these poor accoutrements,
 :
 :'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
 :
 :But what a fool am I to chat with you
 :
 :When I should bid good morrow to my bride
 :And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
 :[Petruchio exits, with Grumio.]
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
 :
 :We will persuade him, be it possible,
 :
 :To put on better ere he go to church.
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :I'll after him, and see the event of this.
 :[All except Tranio and Lucentio exit.]
 :
 :TRANIO
S:
 :But, sir, to love concerneth us to add
 :
S:Her father's liking, which to bring to pass,
 :
 :As I before imparted to your Worship,
 :
 :I am to get a man (whate'er he be
 :
 :It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn),
 :And he shall be "Vincentio of Pisa,"
 :And make assurance here in Padua
 :Of greater sums than I have promised.
 :So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
 :And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
 :
 :Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
 :'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,
S:Which, once performed, let all the world say no,
 :
 :I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :That by degrees we mean to look into,
 :And watch our vantage in this business.
 :We'll overreach the graybeard, Gremio,
 :The narrow prying father, Minola,
 :The quaint musician, amorous Litio,
S:
 :All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Gremio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :As willingly as e'er I came from school.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
 :
S:
 :GREMIO
 :
 :A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
 :
 :A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
 :
S:GREMIO
 :
S:Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.
 :I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
 :Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
 :"Ay, by gog's wouns!" quoth he, and swore so loud
 :That, all amazed, the priest let fall the book,
 :And as he stooped again to take it up,
S:
 :This mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff
 :
S:That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
 :
 :"Now, take them up," quoth he, "if any list."
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :What said the wench when he rose again?
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and swore
 :As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
S:
 :But after many ceremonies done,
 :
S:He calls for wine. "A health!" quoth he, as if
 :
 :He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
 :
 :After a storm; quaffed off the muscatel
 :
 :And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
 :Having no other reason
 :But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,
 :And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking.
 :This done, he took the bride about the neck
 :And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack
S:
 :That at the parting all the church did echo.
 :
S:And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame,
 :
 :And after me I know the rout is coming.
 :
S:Such a mad marriage never was before!	[Music plays.]
 :
 :Hark, hark, I hear the minstrels play.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Bianca, Hortensio, Baptista,

 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
 :
 :I know you think to dine with me today
 :And have prepared great store of wedding cheer,
 :But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
 :And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:
 :Is 't possible you will away tonight?
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :I must away today, before night come.
 :Make it no wonder. If you knew my business,
 :You would entreat me rather go than stay.
 :And, honest company, I thank you all,
 :That have beheld me give away myself
S:
 :To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
 :
S:Dine with my father, drink a health to me,
 :
 :For I must hence, and farewell to you all.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
 :
 :
 :
S:PETRUCHIO  It may not be.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Let me entreat you.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  It cannot be.
 :
 :KATHERINE  Let me entreat you.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:

 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE  Are you content to stay?
 :
 :
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :I am content you shall entreat me stay,
 :
 :But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
S:Now, if you love me, stay.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Grumio, my horse.
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the
 :horses.
 :
 :KATHERINE  Nay, then,
 :Do what thou canst, I will not go today,
S:
 :No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.
 :
 :The door is open, sir. There lies your way.
 :
 :You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.
 :
 :For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
 :'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
 :That take it on you at the first so roundly.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :O Kate, content thee. Prithee, be not angry.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
S:I will be angry. What hast thou to do?--
 :
S:Father, be quiet. He shall stay my leisure.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
 :I see a woman may be made a fool
 :If she had not a spirit to resist.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.--
 :
 :Obey the bride, you that attend on her.
 :Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
 :Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
 :Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
 :But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
S:
S:Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
 :
 :I will be master of what is mine own.
 :
S:She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
 :
 :My household stuff, my field, my barn,
 :
 :My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything.
 :
 :And here she stands, touch her whoever dare.
 :I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
S:That stops my way in Padua.--Grumio,
 :
 :Draw forth thy weapon. We are beset with thieves.
 :
 :Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man!--
 :
 :Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee,
 :Kate.
 :I'll buckler thee against a million.
 :[Petruchio and Katherine exit, with Grumio.]
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :Nay, let them go. A couple of quiet ones!
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
 :

 :Of all mad matches never was the like.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]
 :
 :Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
S:That being mad herself, she's madly mated.

 :Neighbors and friends, though bride and
 :bridegroom wants
 :For to supply the places at the table,
S:
 :You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
 :
 :[To Tranio.] Lucentio, you shall supply the

 :bridegroom's place,
 :
 :And let Bianca take her sister's room.
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]

 :Scene 1
 :=======
 :[Enter Grumio.]
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO  Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters,
 :
 :and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was
 :
 :ever man so 'rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am
 :
 :sent before to make a fire, and they are coming
S:after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and
 :
 :soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
 :
S:tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
 :
 :belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I
 :
S:with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering
 :
S:the weather, a taller man than I will take
 :
 :cold.--Holla, ho, Curtis!
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Curtis.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Who is that calls so coldly?
 :
 :GRUMIO  A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst
S:slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater
 :
S:a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis!
 :
S:
 :
 :CURTIS  Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire! Cast
S:on no water.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But
 :thou know'st winter tames man, woman, and
 :beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new
 :mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.
 :
S:
 :CURTIS  Away, you three-inch fool, I am no beast!
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a
 :
S:foot, and so long am I, at the least. But wilt thou
 :
 :make a fire? Or shall I complain on thee to our
 :
 :mistress, whose hand (she being now at hand) thou
 :
 :shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in
 :thy hot office?
 :
 :CURTIS  I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the
 :world?
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO  A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine,
 :
 :and therefore fire! Do thy duty, and have thy duty,
 :
 :for my master and mistress are almost frozen to
 :
 :death.
 :
 :CURTIS  There's fire ready. And therefore, good Grumio,
 :the news!
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO  Why, "Jack boy, ho boy!" and as much news
 :
 :as wilt thou.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Come, you are so full of cony-catching.
 :
 :GRUMIO  Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme
S:cold. Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house
 :
S:trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen
 :
 :in their new fustian, their white stockings,
 :
 :and every officer his wedding garment on? Be
 :
 :the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the
S:carpets laid, and everything in order?
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  All ready. And therefore, I pray thee, news.
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  First, know my horse is tired, my master and
 :mistress fallen out.
 :
 :CURTIS  How?
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO  Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby
 :
S:hangs a tale.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Let's ha' t, good Grumio.
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO  Lend thine ear.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Here.
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  There!	[He slaps Curtis on the ear.]
 :
 :CURTIS  This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
 :
 :GRUMIO  And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale. And
S:
 :this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech
 :
 :list'ning. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
 :
 :foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress--
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Both of one horse?
 :
 :GRUMIO  What's that to thee?
 :
S:
 :CURTIS  Why, a horse.
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed
 :
 :me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell,
 :
 :and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard
S:in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he
 :
 :left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
 :
 :because her horse stumbled, how she waded
 :
 :through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore,
 :how she prayed that never prayed before, how I
S:cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was
 :
 :burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of
 :
 :worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion,
 :
 :and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.
 :
 :CURTIS  By this reck'ning, he is more shrew than she.
 :
 :GRUMIO  Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all
 :shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of
S:
S:this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Phillip,
 :
 :Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads
 :
 :be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and
 :
 :their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy
 :with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair
 :of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands.
 :Are they all ready?
 :
 :CURTIS  They are.
S:
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO  Call them forth.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS, [calling out]  Do you hear, ho? You must meet
 :
 :my master to countenance my mistress.
S:
 :
S:GRUMIO  Why, she hath a face of her own.
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  Who knows not that?
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
 :countenance her.
 :
 :CURTIS  I call them forth to credit her.
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO  Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter four or five Servingmen.]
 :
 :
 :
 :NATHANIEL  Welcome home, Grumio.
S:
 :
 :PHILLIP  How now, Grumio?
 :
 :
 :
 :JOSEPH  What, Grumio!
 :
 :NICHOLAS  Fellow Grumio!
S:
 :
 :NATHANIEL  How now, old lad?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Welcome, you!--How now, you?--What,
 :you!--Fellow, you!--And thus much for greeting.
 :Now, my spruce companions, is all ready and all
 :things neat?
 :
 :NATHANIEL  All things is ready. How near is our
S:
 :master?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  E'en at hand, alighted by this. And therefore
 :
S:be not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Petruchio and Katherine.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
S:To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?
 :
 :Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Phillip?
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL THE SERVANTS  Here! Here, sir, here, sir!
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :"Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir!"
 :You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms.
 :What? No attendance? No regard? No duty?
S:
 :Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
 :
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO
 :
 :Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :You peasant swain, you whoreson malt-horse
 :drudge!
S:Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
 :
 :And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
 :And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel.
 :There was no link to color Peter's hat,
 :And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing.
 :There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory.
S:
 :The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.
 :
 :Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in!
 :[The Servants exit.]
 :[Sings.]	Where is the life that late I led?
 :Where are those--
S:
 :Sit down, Kate, and welcome.
 :
S:[They sit at a table.]
 :
 :Soud, soud, soud, soud!
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Servants with supper.]
S:
 :
 :Why, when, I say?--Nay, good sweet Kate, be
 :
S:merry.--
 :
 :Off with my boots, you rogues, you villains! When?
 :
S:[Sings.]	It was the friar of orders gray,
 :
 :As he forth walked on his way--
 :
 :
 :
 :[Servant begins to remove Petruchio's boots.]
S:
 :
 :Out, you rogue! You pluck my foot awry.
 :
 :Take that!	[He hits the Servant.]
 :
 :And mend the plucking of the other.--
 :Be merry, Kate.--Some water here! What ho!
 :
 :[Enter one with water.]
 :
 :Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence
S:
 :And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither.
 :
 :[A Servant exits.]
 :
 :One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted
 :
 :with.--
 :Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?--
 :Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.--
S:You whoreson villain, will you let it fall?
 :
 :[He hits the Servant.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Patience, I pray you, 'twas a fault unwilling.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :A whoreson beetle-headed flap-eared knave!--
 :Come, Kate, sit down. I know you have a stomach.
S:
S:Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?--
 :
 :What's this? Mutton?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST SERVANT  Ay.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Who brought it?
 :
 :PETER  I.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO  'Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.
 :
 :What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
 :
 :How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser
 :
 :And serve it thus to me that love it not?
 :There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!
 :[He throws the food and dishes at them.]
 :You heedless joltheads and unmannered slaves!
 :What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
S:
 :[The Servants exit.]
 :
S:
 :
S:KATHERINE
 :
 :I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.
 :
 :The meat was well, if you were so contented.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
 :
 :And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
 :
 :For it engenders choler, planteth anger,
 :
 :And better 'twere that both of us did fast
S:(Since of ourselves, ourselves are choleric)
 :
 :Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
 :
 :Be patient. Tomorrow 't shall be mended,
 :
 :And for this night we'll fast for company.
 :Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
 :[They exit.]
 :
 :[Enter Servants severally.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :NATHANIEL  Peter, didst ever see the like?
 :
 :
 :PETER  He kills her in her own humor.
 :
 :[Enter Curtis.]
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  Where is he?
 :
 :
 :
 :CURTIS  In her chamber,
 :Making a sermon of continency to her,
 :And rails and swears and rates, that she (poor soul)
 :Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
 :And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
S:Away, away, for he is coming hither!
 :
 :[The Servants exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Petruchio.]
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
S:And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
 :
 :My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,
 :
 :And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged,
 :
 :For then she never looks upon her lure.
 :Another way I have to man my haggard,
 :To make her come and know her keeper's call.
S:That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
 :
 :That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
 :
 :She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.
 :
 :Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.
 :As with the meat, some undeserved fault
 :I'll find about the making of the bed,
 :And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
 :This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.
S:Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
 :
 :That all is done in reverend care of her.
 :
S:And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night,
 :
 :And, if she chance to nod, I'll rail and brawl,
 :
 :And with the clamor keep her still awake.
 :
 :This is a way to kill a wife with kindness.
 :And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor.
 :He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
 :Now let him speak; 'tis charity to shew.
 :[He exits.]

 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Is 't possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca
 :Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
S:

S:

S:Now mistress, profit you in what you read?
 :

 :
 :What, master, read you? First resolve me that.
S:
 :
S:LUCENTIO, [as Cambio]

S:Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
 :
 :You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca
 :
 :Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :O despiteful love, unconstant womankind!
 :I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:
 :Mistake no more. I am not Litio,
 :
 :Nor a musician as I seem to be,
 :
 :But one that scorn to live in this disguise
 :
 :For such a one as leaves a gentleman
 :And makes a god of such a cullion.
 :Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:
 :Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
 :
 :Of your entire affection to Bianca,
 :
 :And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
 :
S:I will with you, if you be so contented,
 :
 :Forswear Bianca and her love forever.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :See how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
 :Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
 :Never to woo her more, but do forswear her
 :As one unworthy all the former favors
S:That I have fondly flattered her withal.
 :
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
 :
 :Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.
 :Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him!
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
 :For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
S:
 :I will be married to a wealthy widow
 :
 :Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
 :
 :As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
 :
 :And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
 :Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
 :Shall win my love, and so I take my leave,
S:In resolution as I swore before.
 :
 :[Hortensio exits;]
 :
 :[Bianca and Lucentio come forward.]
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
 :As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
S:Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
 :
 :And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
 :
 :
 :
S:BIANCA
 :
S:Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :Mistress, we have.
 :
S:LUCENTIO  Then we are rid of Litio.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now
 :That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.
 :
 :BIANCA  God give him joy.
 :
 :TRANIO
S:
 :Ay, and he'll tame her.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA  He says so, Tranio?
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.
 :
 :BIANCA
S:
 :The taming school? What, is there such a place?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,
 :That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long
 :To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
 :
S:[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :O master, master, I have watched so long
 :That I am dog-weary, but at last I spied
 :An ancient angel coming down the hill
 :Will serve the turn.
 :
S:
S:TRANIO  What is he, Biondello?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :
 :Master, a marcantant, or a pedant,
 :I know not what, but formal in apparel,
 :In gait and countenance surely like a father.
 :
 :LUCENTIO  And what of him, Tranio?
 :
S:
 :TRANIO
 :
 :If he be credulous, and trust my tale,
 :
 :I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio
 :
 :And give assurance to Baptista Minola
 :As if he were the right Vincentio.
 :Take in your love, and then let me alone.

 :
 :Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,
 :But then up farther, and as far as Rome,
 :And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
S:
 :
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :What countryman, I pray?
 :
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT  Of Mantua.
S:

 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]

 :Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!
 :
 :And come to Padua, careless of your life?
S:
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :
 :My life, sir? How, I pray? For that goes hard.
 :
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :'Tis death for anyone in Mantua
 :
 :To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
 :Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the Duke,
 :For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
 :Hath published and proclaimed it openly.
 :'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
 :You might have heard it else proclaimed about.
S:
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :
 :Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,
 :
 :For I have bills for money by exchange
 :From Florence, and must here deliver them.
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
 :
 :This will I do, and this I will advise you.
 :First tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
S:
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :
S:Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
 :
 :Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Among them know you one Vincentio?
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :I know him not, but I have heard of him:
S:A merchant of incomparable wealth.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,
 :In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
 :
 :BIONDELLO, [aside]  As much as an apple doth an
 :oyster, and all one.
 :
S:
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:To save your life in this extremity,
 :
 :This favor will I do you for his sake
 :
 :(And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
 :
 :That you are like to Sir Vincentio):
 :His name and credit shall you undertake,
S:And in my house you shall be friendly lodged.
 :
 :Look that you take upon you as you should.
 :
 :You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
 :
 :Till you have done your business in the city.
 :If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
 :
 :MERCHANT
S:O sir, I do, and will repute you ever
 :
 :The patron of my life and liberty.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Then go with me, to make the matter good.
 :This, by the way, I let you understand:
 :My father is here looked for every day
 :To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
S:'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
 :
 :In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
 :
 :Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

 :Scene 3
 :=======
 :[Enter Katherine and Grumio.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO
 :
 :No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
S:What, did he marry me to famish me?
 :
 :Beggars that come unto my father's door
 :
 :Upon entreaty have a present alms.
 :
 :If not, elsewhere they meet with charity.
 :But I, who never knew how to entreat,
 :Nor never needed that I should entreat,
 :Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
 :With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed.
 :And that which spites me more than all these wants,
S:
 :He does it under name of perfect love,
 :
 :As who should say, if I should sleep or eat
 :
S:'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
 :
 :I prithee, go, and get me some repast,
 :
 :I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO  What say you to a neat's foot?
 :
 :
 :
S:KATHERINE
 :
 :'Tis passing good. I prithee let me have it.
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :
 :I fear it is too choleric a meat.
 :
S:How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled?
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :I like it well. Good Grumio, fetch it me.
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO
 :
 :I cannot tell. I fear 'tis choleric.
 :
 :What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
 :
 :
S:KATHERINE
 :
 :A dish that I do love to feed upon.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO
 :
 :Nay then, I will not. You shall have the mustard
 :
 :Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
S:Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO
 :
 :Why then, the mustard without the beef.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
S:[She beats him.]
 :
 :That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
 :
 :Sorrow on thee, and all the pack of you
 :
S:That triumph thus upon my misery.
 :
 :Go, get thee gone, I say.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Petruchio and Hortensio with meat.]
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
 :
S:
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :Mistress, what cheer?
 :
S:
 :
S:KATHERINE  Faith, as cold as can be.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Pluck up thy spirits. Look cheerfully upon me.
 :Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
 :To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee.
 :I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
 :What, not a word? Nay then, thou lov'st it not,
S:And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
 :
 :Here, take away this dish.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  I pray you, let it stand.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :The poorest service is repaid with thanks,
 :And so shall mine before you touch the meat.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE  I thank you, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Signior Petruchio, fie, you are to blame.
 :Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [aside to Hortensio]
S:Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.--
 :
 :Much good do it unto thy gentle heart.
 :
 :Kate, eat apace.
 :
 :[Katherine and Hortensio prepare to eat.]
 :And now, my honey love,
 :Will we return unto thy father's house
 :And revel it as bravely as the best,
 :With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
S:With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
 :
 :With scarves and fans and double change of brav'ry,
 :
 :With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
 :
 :What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure
 :To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
 :
S:[Enter Tailor.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.
 :
 :Lay forth the gown.
 :
 :[Enter Haberdasher.]
 :
 :What news with you, sir?
 :
S:
 :HABERDASHER
 :
S:Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Why, this was molded on a porringer!
 :A velvet dish! Fie, fie, 'tis lewd and filthy.
S:Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell,
 :
S:A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
 :
S:Away with it! Come, let me have a bigger.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :I'll have no bigger. This doth fit the time,
 :And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
 :And not till then.
S:
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO, [aside]  That will not be in haste.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
S:Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,
 :
 :And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
 :
 :Your betters have endured me say my mind,
 :
 :And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
S:My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
 :
 :Or else my heart, concealing it, will break,
 :
 :And, rather than it shall, I will be free
 :
 :Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Why, thou sayst true. It is a paltry cap,
 :A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.
 :I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
S:
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Love me, or love me not, I like the cap,
 :
 :And it I will have, or I will have none.
 :[Exit Haberdasher.]
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see 't.
 :
 :O mercy God, what masking-stuff is here?
 :
 :What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
 :
 :What, up and down carved like an apple tart?
 :Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
 :Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
 :Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
 :
S:HORTENSIO, [aside]
 :
 :I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
 :
S:
 :
 :TAILOR
 :
 :You bid me make it orderly and well,
 :
 :According to the fashion and the time.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Marry, and did. But if you be remembered,
 :I did not bid you mar it to the time.
 :Go, hop me over every kennel home,
S:
 :For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
 :
 :I'll none of it. Hence, make your best of it.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :I never saw a better-fashioned gown,
 :More quaint, more pleasing, nor more
 :commendable.
 :Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
S:Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR
 :
S:She says your Worship means to make a puppet of
 :
 :her.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
S:thou thimble,
 :
 :Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
 :
 :Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket, thou!
 :
 :Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
 :Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
 :Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
 :As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st.
S:I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR
 :
 :Your Worship is deceived. The gown is made
 :Just as my master had direction.
 :Grumio gave order how it should be done.
 :
 :GRUMIO  I gave him no order. I gave him the stuff.
 :
S:
 :TAILOR
 :
 :But how did you desire it should be made?
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
 :
 :TAILOR
 :But did you not request to have it cut?
 :
S:
 :GRUMIO  Thou hast faced many things.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR  I have.
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Face not me. Thou hast braved many men;
 :brave not me. I will neither be faced nor braved. I
 :say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown,
 :but I did not bid him cut it to pieces. Ergo, thou
S:
 :liest.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR  Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
 :
 :[He shows a paper.]
 :
S:PETRUCHIO  Read it.
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  The note lies in 's throat, if he say I said so.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR [reads]  "Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown--"
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  Master, if ever I said "loose-bodied gown,"
 :
 :sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with
 :
 :a bottom of brown thread. I said "a gown."
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Proceed.
S:
 :
S:TAILOR [reads]  "With a small-compassed cape--"
 :
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  I confess the cape.
 :
 :
 :
 :TAILOR [reads]  "With a trunk sleeve--"
 :
 :GRUMIO  I confess two sleeves.
 :
 :TAILOR [reads]  "The sleeves curiously cut."
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Ay, there's the villainy.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  Error i' th' bill, sir, error i' th' bill! I command
 :ed
 :the sleeves should be cut out and sewed
 :up again, and that I'll prove upon thee, though thy
 :little finger be armed in a thimble.
 :
S:
 :TAILOR  This is true that I say. An I had thee in place
 :
 :where, thou shouldst know it.
 :
 :
 :
 :GRUMIO  I am for thee straight. Take thou the bill, give
 :me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
 :
 :HORTENSIO  God-a-mercy, Grumio, then he shall have
 :no odds.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
 :
 :
S:GRUMIO  You are i' th' right, sir, 'tis for my mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
 :
 :GRUMIO  Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress'
 :gown for thy master's use!
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
S:
S:
 :
 :GRUMIO  O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think
 :
 :for. Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
 :
 :O, fie, fie, fie!
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [aside to Hortensio]
 :
 :Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
 :
 :[To Tailor.] Go, take it hence. Begone, and say no
S:more.
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [aside to Tailor]
 :
 :Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow.
S:Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
 :
 :Away, I say. Commend me to thy master.
 :
 :[Tailor exits.]
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Well, come, my Kate, we will unto your father's,
 :Even in these honest mean habiliments.
 :Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,
 :For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich,
S:
 :And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
 :
S:So honor peereth in the meanest habit.
 :
 :What, is the jay more precious than the lark
 :
 :Because his feathers are more beautiful?
 :
 :Or is the adder better than the eel
 :Because his painted skin contents the eye?
 :O no, good Kate. Neither art thou the worse
S:For this poor furniture and mean array.
 :
 :If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me,
 :
 :And therefore frolic! We will hence forthwith
 :
 :To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
S:[To Grumio.] Go, call my men, and let us straight to
 :
 :him,
 :
 :And bring our horses unto Long-lane end.
 :
 :There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
 :Let's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
 :And well we may come there by dinner time.
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
S:
 :And 'twill be supper time ere you come there.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
 :Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
S:You are still crossing it.--Sirs, let 't alone.
 :
 :I will not go today, and, ere I do,
 :
 :It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO, [aside]
 :Why, so, this gallant will command the sun!
S:[They exit.]

S:[Enter Tranio as Lucentio, and the Merchant, booted,

 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :Sir, this is the house. Please it you that I call?
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :Ay, what else? And but I be deceived,
S:
 :Signior Baptista may remember me,
 :
 :Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
 :
 :Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :'Tis well. And hold your own in any case
S:With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
 :
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT
 :
 :I warrant you.
 :
S:[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :But, sir, here comes your boy.
 :
 :'Twere good he were schooled.
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Fear you not him.--Sirrah Biondello,
 :
 :Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
 :Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Tut, fear not me.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:
 :But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :
 :I told him that your father was at Venice,
 :And that you looked for him this day in Padua.
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
S:Thou 'rt a tall fellow. Hold thee that to drink.
 :
 :[He gives him money.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Baptista and Lucentio as Cambio.]
 :
 :Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
 :[Merchant stands bareheaded.]
S:
 :
S:TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Signior Baptista, you are happily met.--
 :
 :Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
 :
 :I pray you stand good father to me now.
 :Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Soft, son.--
 :Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua
S:To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
 :
 :Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
 :
 :Of love between your daughter and himself.
 :
 :And, for the good report I hear of you,
S:And for the love he beareth to your daughter
 :
 :And she to him, to stay him not too long,
 :
S:I am content, in a good father's care,
 :
 :To have him matched. And if you please to like
 :
S:No worse than I, upon some agreement
 :
 :Me shall you find ready and willing
 :
 :With one consent to have her so bestowed,
 :
 :For curious I cannot be with you,
S:Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
 :Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
 :Right true it is your son Lucentio here
S:Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
 :
 :Or both dissemble deeply their affections.
 :
S:And therefore, if you say no more than this,
 :
 :That like a father you will deal with him
 :
 :And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
 :
 :The match is made, and all is done.
 :Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
 :We be affied and such assurance ta'en
S:
 :As shall with either part's agreement stand?
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
S:Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
 :
 :Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
 :
 :Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
 :
 :And happily we might be interrupted.
S:
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
 :
 :Then at my lodging, an it like you.
 :
 :There doth my father lie, and there this night
 :We'll pass the business privately and well.
 :Send for your daughter by your servant here.
S:[He indicates Lucentio, and winks at him.]
 :
 :My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
 :
 :The worst is this: that at so slender warning
 :
 :You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :It likes me well.--Cambio, hie you home,
 :And bid Bianca make her ready straight.
 :And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
S:
 :Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
 :
 :And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
 :
 :[Lucentio exits.]
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]
S:
 :Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.--
 :
S:Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
 :
 :Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.
 :
 :Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.
 :
 :
S:BAPTISTA  I follow you.
 :
 :[All but Biondello exit.]
 :
 :

S:[Enter Lucentio.]
 :
 :

 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Cambio.
 :
S:LUCENTIO  What sayst thou, Biondello?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  You saw my master wink and laugh upon
 :
 :you?
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Biondello, what of that?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Faith, nothing; but 'has left me here behind
S:to expound the meaning or moral of his signs
 :
 :and tokens.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO  I pray thee, moralize them.
 :
S:
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with
 :
 :the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
 :
 :
S:LUCENTIO  And what of him?
 :
 :
 :
S:BIONDELLO  His daughter is to be brought by you to the
 :
 :supper.
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO  And then?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at
 :your command at all hours.
 :
 :LUCENTIO  And what of all this?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  I cannot tell, except they are busied
S:
 :about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance
 :
 :of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To th'
 :
 :church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
 :
 :honest witnesses.
 :If this be not that you look for, I have no more to
 :say,
 :But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Hear'st thou, Biondello?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in
 :an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley
 :to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so adieu,
S:sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
 :
 :Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against
 :
 :you come with your appendix.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :I may, and will, if she be so contented.
 :She will be pleased. Then wherefore should I
 :doubt?
 :Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her.
S:
 :It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her.

 :
 :Come on, i' God's name, once more toward our

 :
 :Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

 :The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
 :
S:

 :Happier the man whom favorable stars
 :Allots thee for his lovely bedfellow.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Why, how now, Kate? I hope thou art not mad!
S:
 :This is a man--old, wrinkled, faded, withered--
 :
 :And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes
 :That have been so bedazzled with the sun
 :That everything I look on seemeth green.
S:Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
 :
 :Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
 :Which way thou travelest. If along with us,
 :We shall be joyful of thy company.
 :
 :VINCENTIO
S:
 :Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress,
 :
 :That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
 :
 :My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
 :
S:And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
 :
 :A son of mine which long I have not seen.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :What is his name?
 :
S:VINCENTIO  Lucentio, gentle sir.
 :
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Happily met, the happier for thy son.
 :
 :And now by law as well as reverend age,
 :I may entitle thee my loving father.
S:The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
 :
 :Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
 :
 :Nor be not grieved. She is of good esteem,
 :
 :Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
 :Beside, so qualified as may beseem
 :The spouse of any noble gentleman.
S:Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
 :
 :And wander we to see thy honest son,
 :
 :Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO
 :But is this true, or is it else your pleasure,
S:Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest
 :
 :Upon the company you overtake?
 :
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :I do assure thee, father, so it is.
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Come, go along and see the truth hereof,
 :
 :For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
 :
 :[All but Hortensio exit.]
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart!
 :
 :Have to my widow, and if she be froward,
 :
 :Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
 :
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 1
 :
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Biondello, Lucentio as himself, and Bianca.
 :
S:Gremio is out before and stands to the side.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:BIONDELLO  Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is
 :
S:ready.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  I fly, Biondello. But they may chance to
 :
 :need thee at home. Therefore leave us.
S:[Lucentio exits with Bianca.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Nay, faith, I'll see the church a' your back,
 :
 :and then come back to my master's as soon as I
 :can.	[He exits.]
 :
 :GREMIO  I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
 :
 :[Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Vincentio, Grumio, with
S:
 :Attendants.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Sir, here's the door. This is Lucentio's house.
S:My father's bears more toward the marketplace.
 :
 :Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO
 :You shall not choose but drink before you go.
 :I think I shall command your welcome here,
S:And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.
 :
 :[He knocks.]
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO, [coming forward]
 :They're busy within. You were best knock louder.
 :[Merchant looks out of the window.]
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  What's he that knocks as
 :he would beat down the gate?
S:
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  He's within, sir, but not to
 :be spoken withal.
S:
 :
 :VINCENTIO  What if a man bring him a hundred pound
 :
 :or two to make merry withal?
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Keep your hundred
 :pounds to yourself. He shall need none so long as I
S:live.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [to Vincentio]  Nay, I told you your son was
 :
 :well beloved in Padua.--Do you hear, sir? To leave
 :frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior
 :Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is
 :here at the door to speak with him.
 :
S:MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Thou liest. His father is
 :
 :come from Padua and here looking out at the
 :
 :window.
 :
 :
S:VINCENTIO  Art thou his father?
 :
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Ay, sir, so his mother says,
 :
 :if I may believe her.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO, [to Vincentio]  Why, how now, gentleman!
 :
S:Why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another
 :
 :man's name.
 :
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Lay hands on the villain. I
 :believe he means to cosen somebody in this city
S:under my countenance.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO, [aside]  I have seen them in the church
 :together. God send 'em good shipping! But who is
 :here? Mine old master Vincentio! Now we are
 :undone and brought to nothing.
 :
S:
 :VINCENTIO, [to Biondello]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
 :
 :
 :
S:BIONDELLO  I hope I may choose, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Come hither, you rogue! What, have you
 :
 :forgot me?
 :
S:BIONDELLO  Forgot you? No, sir. I could not forget you,
 :
 :for I never saw you before in all my life.
 :
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO  What, you notorious villain, didst thou
 :never see thy master's father, Vincentio?
 :
 :BIONDELLO  What, my old worshipful old master? Yes,
 :marry, sir. See where he looks out of the window.
 :
S:
 :VINCENTIO  Is 't so indeed?	[He beats Biondello.]
 :
S:
 :
 :BIONDELLO  Help, help, help! Here's a madman will
 :
 :murder me.	[Biondello exits.]
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Help, son! Help, Signior
 :Baptista!	[He exits from window.]
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the
 :end of this controversy.	[They move aside.]
S:
 :
 :
S:[Enter Merchant with Servants, and Baptista and
 :
 :Tranio disguised as Lucentio.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Sir, what are you that offer to
 :beat my servant?
 :
 :VINCENTIO  What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir! O
 :immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a
S:
 :velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I
 :
 :am undone, I am undone! While I play the good
 :
 :husband at home, my son and my servant spend all
 :
S:at the university.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  How now, what's the matter?
 :
S:
 :
S:BAPTISTA  What, is the man lunatic?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Sir, you seem a sober ancient
 :
 :gentleman by your habit, but your words show you
S:a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear
 :
 :pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able
 :
 :to maintain it.
 :
 :
S:VINCENTIO  Thy father! O villain, he is a sailmaker in
 :
 :Bergamo.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA  You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir! Pray, what
 :do you think is his name?
 :
 :VINCENTIO  His name? As if I knew not his name! I have
 :brought him up ever since he was three years old,
 :and his name is Tranio.
S:
 :
 :
 :MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Away, away, mad ass! His
 :
 :name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir
 :
 :to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Lucentio? O, he hath murdered his master!
S:Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke's name.
 :
S:O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is
 :
 :my son Lucentio?
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Call forth an officer.
 :
 :[Enter an Officer.]
 :
S:Carry this mad knave to the jail.--Father Baptista, I
 :
 :charge you see that he be forthcoming.
 :
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Carry me to the jail?
 :
 :GREMIO  Stay, officer. He shall not go to prison.
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Talk not, Signior Gremio. I say he shall go to
 :prison.
S:
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catche
 :d
 :
 :in this business. I dare swear this is the
 :right Vincentio.
S:
 :
S:MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Swear, if thou dar'st.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Nay, I dare not swear it.
 :
 :
 :TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Then thou wert best say that I
S:am not Lucentio.
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA  Away with the dotard, to the jail with him.
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Thus strangers may be haled and abused.--
 :O monstrous villain!
 :
S:
S:[Enter Biondello, Lucentio and Bianca.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO  O, we are spoiled, and yonder he is! Deny
 :him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.
 :[Biondello, Tranio, and Merchant
 :exit as fast as may be.]
 :
S:LUCENTIO
 :
S:Pardon, sweet father.	[Lucentio and Bianca kneel.]
 :
 :
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Lives my sweet son?
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Pardon, dear father.
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA  How hast thou offended?
 :
S:Where is Lucentio?
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Here's Lucentio,
 :
 :Right son to the right Vincentio,
 :
 :That have by marriage made thy daughter mine
 :While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
 :
 :GREMIO
 :Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
 :
S:
 :VINCENTIO
 :
 :Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
 :
 :That faced and braved me in this matter so?
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
S:
 :
 :BIANCA
 :
 :Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
 :
 :
S:LUCENTIO
 :
 :Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
 :
 :Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
 :
 :While he did bear my countenance in the town,
S:And happily I have arrived at the last
 :
 :Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
 :
 :What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.
 :
 :Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
S:
 :
 :VINCENTIO  I'll slit the villain's nose that would have
 :
 :sent me to the jail!
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA  But do you hear, sir, have you married my
 :daughter without asking my goodwill?
 :
 :VINCENTIO  Fear not, Baptista, we will content you. Go
 :to! But I will in to be revenged for this villainy.
S:
S:[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :BAPTISTA  And I to sound the depth of this knavery.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Look not pale, Bianca. Thy father will not
 :frown.	[They exit.]
 :
 :GREMIO
 :My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest,
S:
 :Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.
 :
S:[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  Husband, let's follow to see the end of
 :
 :this ado.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE  What, in the midst of the street?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  What, art thou ashamed of me?
 :
 :KATHERINE  No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Why, then, let's home again. [To Grumio.] Come,
 :
 :sirrah, let's away.
 :
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Nay, I will give thee a kiss.	[She kisses him.]
 :
 :Now pray thee, love, stay.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate.
 :Better once than never, for never too late.

 :Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Merchant,
 :Lucentio, and Bianca; Hortensio and the Widow,
S:Petruchio and Katherine; Tranio, Biondello, and
 :
 :Grumio, with Servingmen bringing in a banquet.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,
 :And time it is when raging war is done
 :To smile at 'scapes and perils overblown.
 :My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
 :While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine.
S:Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
 :
 :And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
 :
 :Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
 :
 :My banquet is to close our stomachs up
 :After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down,
 :For now we sit to chat as well as eat.	[They sit.]
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
S:
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :For both our sakes I would that word were true.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow!
S:
 :
 :
 :WIDOW
 :
 :Then never trust me if I be afeard.
 :
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
 :
 :I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
 :
 :
 :WIDOW
S:He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Roundly replied.
 :
S:KATHERINE  Mistress, how mean you that?
 :
S:
 :
 :WIDOW  Thus I conceive by him.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Conceives by me? How likes Hortensio that?
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :"He that is giddy thinks the world turns round"--
 :I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
 :
 :WIDOW
S:
 :Your husband being troubled with a shrew
 :
 :Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe.
 :
 :And now you know my meaning.
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :A very mean meaning.
 :
S:WIDOW  Right, I mean you.
 :
 :
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  To her, Kate!
 :
 :HORTENSIO  To her, widow!
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
 :
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO  That's my office.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Spoke like an officer! Ha' to thee, lad.
 :[He drinks to Hortensio.]
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
 :
 :
 :
 :GREMIO
 :
 :Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
 :Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
 :
S:
 :VINCENTIO
 :
 :Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Ay, but not frighted me. Therefore I'll sleep again.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Nay, that you shall not. Since you have begun,
S:
 :Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
 :
 :
 :
 :BIANCA
 :
 :Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
S:And then pursue me as you draw your bow.--
 :
 :You are welcome all.	[Bianca, Katherine, and the Widow exit.
 :]
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
S:This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.--
 :
 :Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.
 :
 :
 :
 :TRANIO
 :O, sir, Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound,
 :Which runs himself and catches for his master.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :A good swift simile, but something currish.
S:
S:
 :
 :TRANIO
 :
 :'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.
 :
 :'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :Confess, confess! Hath he not hit you here?
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :He has a little galled me, I confess.
 :
 :And as the jest did glance away from me,
 :
 :'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
 :I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Well, I say no. And therefore, for assurance,
 :
 :Let's each one send unto his wife,
 :
 :And he whose wife is most obedient
 :To come at first when he doth send for her
 :Shall win the wager which we will propose.
 :
S:HORTENSIO
 :
 :Content, what's the wager?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  Twenty crowns.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Twenty crowns?
 :I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
 :But twenty times so much upon my wife.
S:
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :A hundred, then.
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO  Content.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  A match! 'Tis done.
 :
 :
S:HORTENSIO  Who shall begin?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO  That will I.
 :
 :Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
 :
 :BIONDELLO  I go.	[He exits.]
 :
 :BAPTISTA
S:Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
 :
 :
 :
S:LUCENTIO
 :
 :I'll have no halves. I'll bear it all myself.
 :
 :[Enter Biondello.]
 :
 :
 :How now, what news?
 :
S:BIONDELLO  Sir, my mistress sends you
 :
 :word
 :
 :That she is busy, and she cannot come.
 :
 :
S:PETRUCHIO
 :
 :How? "She's busy, and she cannot come"?
 :
 :Is that an answer?
 :
 :
 :GREMIO  Ay, and a kind one, too.
S:Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  I hope better.
 :
 :
 :HORTENSIO
S:Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
 :
 :To come to me forthwith.	[Biondello exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  O ho, entreat her!
 :Nay, then, she must needs come.
 :
 :HORTENSIO  I am afraid, sir,
 :Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Biondello.]
 :
S:
 :
S:Now, where's my wife?
 :
 :
 :
 :BIONDELLO
 :
 :She says you have some goodly jest in hand.
 :She will not come. She bids you come to her.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Worse and worse. She will not come!
 :O vile, intolerable, not to be endured!--
 :Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,
S:
S:Say I command her come to me.	[Grumio exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :I know her answer.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  What?
 :
 :HORTENSIO  She will not.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:
 :The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Katherine.]
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :Now by my holidam, here comes Katherina!
 :
S:
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Go fetch them hither. If they deny to come,
 :
 :Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
 :Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
 :[Katherine exits.]
 :
 :LUCENTIO
S:
S:Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
 :
S:
 :
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
 :An awful rule, and right supremacy,
S:And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.
 :
 :
 :
 :BAPTISTA
 :
 :Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
 :The wager thou hast won, and I will add
 :Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,
 :Another dowry to another daughter,
 :For she is changed as she had never been.
 :
S:
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
 :
 :And show more sign of her obedience,
 :
 :Her new-built virtue and obedience.
 :
 :[Enter Katherine, Bianca, and Widow.]
 :
 :See where she comes, and brings your froward
S:
 :wives
 :
S:As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.--
 :
 :Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not.
 :
S:Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
 :
 :[She obeys.]
 :
 :
 :
 :WIDOW
 :Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
 :Till I be brought to such a silly pass.
 :
 :BIANCA
 :Fie, what a foolish duty call you this?
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :
 :I would your duty were as foolish too.
 :
 :The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
 :Hath cost me a hundred crowns since suppertime.
 :
 :BIANCA
 :The more fool you for laying on my duty.
S:
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
 :Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong
 :
 :women
 :What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
 :
 :WIDOW
 :Come, come, you're mocking. We will have no
S:
 :telling.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :
S:Come on, I say, and first begin with her.
 :
 :
 :
 :WIDOW  She shall not.
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
 :I say she shall.--And first begin with her.
S:
 :
 :KATHERINE
 :
 :Fie, fie! Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow,
 :
 :And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
 :To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
 :It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
 :Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
 :And in no sense is meet or amiable.
 :A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
S:
 :Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,
 :
 :And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
 :
 :Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
 :
 :Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
 :Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,
S:And for thy maintenance commits his body
 :
 :To painful labor both by sea and land,
 :
 :To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
 :
 :Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,
S:And craves no other tribute at thy hands
 :
 :But love, fair looks, and true obedience--
 :
 :Too little payment for so great a debt.
 :
 :Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
 :Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
 :And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
 :And not obedient to his honest will,
 :What is she but a foul contending rebel
 :And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
S:
 :I am ashamed that women are so simple
 :
 :To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
 :
S:Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway
 :
S:When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
 :
 :Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
 :
 :Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
 :
 :But that our soft conditions and our hearts
S:Should well agree with our external parts?
 :
 :Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
 :
 :My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
 :
 :My heart as great, my reason haply more,
 :To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
S:But now I see our lances are but straws,
 :
 :Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
 :
 :That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
 :
S:Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
 :
 :And place your hands below your husband's foot;
 :
 :In token of which duty, if he please,
 :
 :My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
 :
 :PETRUCHIO
S:Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
 :
 :[They kiss.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha 't.
 :
 :VINCENTIO
 :'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 :
S:
 :LUCENTIO
 :
S:But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
 :
 :
 :
 :PETRUCHIO  Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
 :
 :We three are married, but you two are sped.
 :[To Lucentio.] 'Twas I won the wager, though you
 :hit the white,
 :And being a winner, God give you good night.
 :[Petruchio and Katherine exit.]
 :
S:
 :HORTENSIO
 :
 :Now, go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrow.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCENTIO
 :'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
 :[They exit.]
