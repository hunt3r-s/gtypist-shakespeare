 :Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Demetrius and Philo.]
 :
 :
 :PHILO
 :Nay, but this dotage of our general's
 :O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
S:
 :That o'er the files and musters of the war
 :
S:Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
 :
 :The office and devotion of their view
 :
S:Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
 :
 :Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
 :
 :The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper
 :
 :And is become the bellows and the fan
 :To cool a gypsy's lust.
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter Antony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train,
 :with Eunuchs fanning her.]
 :
S:
 :Look where they come.
 :
 :Take but good note, and you shall see in him
 :
 :The triple pillar of the world transformed
 :
 :Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new
S:
 :Earth.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  News, my good lord, from Rome.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Grates me, the sum.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Nay, hear them, Antony.
 :Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows
S:If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
 :
 :His powerful mandate to you: "Do this, or this;
 :
 :Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that.
 :
 :Perform 't, or else we damn thee."
 :
 :ANTONY  How, my love?
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Perchance? Nay, and most like.
 :You must not stay here longer; your dismission
S:
 :Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony.
 :
 :Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's, I would say--
 :
 :both?
 :
S:Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
 :
S:Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
 :
 :Is Caesar's homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
 :
 :When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
 :Of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space.
 :Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike
 :Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
S:
 :Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
 :
 :And such a twain can do 't, in which I bind,
 :
 :On pain of punishment, the world to weet
 :
 :We stand up peerless.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Excellent falsehood!
 :Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
 :I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
S:
 :Will be himself.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  But stirred by Cleopatra.
 :
 :Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
 :Let's not confound the time with conference harsh.
 :There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
S:Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Hear the ambassadors.
 :
 :ANTONY  Fie, wrangling queen,
S:Whom everything becomes--to chide, to laugh,
 :
 :To weep; whose every passion fully strives
 :
 :To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
 :
 :No messenger but thine, and all alone
S:Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note
 :
 :The qualities of people. Come, my queen,
 :
S:Last night you did desire it. [To the Messenger.]
 :
 :Speak not to us.
 :
 :[Antony and Cleopatra exit with the Train.]
 :
 :
 :DEMETRIUS
 :Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
 :
 :PHILO
 :Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony
S:
 :He comes too short of that great property
 :
 :Which still should go with Antony.
 :
 :
 :
S:DEMETRIUS  I am full sorry
 :
 :That he approves the common liar who
 :
 :Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
 :
S:Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!

 :=======
 :[Enter Enobarbus, Lamprius, a Soothsayer, Rannius,
 :Lucillius, Charmian, Iras, Mardian the Eunuch, Alexas,
 :and Servants.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything
 :
 :Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the
 :
 :soothsayer that you praised so to th' Queen? O, that
 :I knew this husband which you say must charge
 :his horns with garlands!
 :
S:ALEXAS  Soothsayer!
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER  Your will?
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN
S:Is this the man?--Is 't you, sir, that know things?
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :In nature's infinite book of secrecy
 :A little I can read.
 :
 :ALEXAS, [to Charmian]  Show him your hand.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS, [to Servants]
S:
 :Bring in the banquet quickly, wine enough
 :
 :Cleopatra's health to drink.
 :
 :
 :
S:CHARMIAN, [giving her hand to the Soothsayer]  Good sir,
 :
 :give me good fortune.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER  I make not, but foresee.
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Pray then, foresee me one.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  He means in flesh.
 :
S:IRAS  No, you shall paint when you are old.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Wrinkles forbid!
 :
 :
 :ALEXAS  Vex not his prescience. Be attentive.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Hush.
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
S:
S:You shall be more beloving than beloved.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
 :
S:
 :
 :ALEXAS  Nay, hear him.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me
 :be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow
 :them all. Let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod
S:of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me
 :
 :with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my
 :
S:mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
 :You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
 :Than that which is to approach.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Then belike my children shall have no
S:names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches must
 :
 :I have?
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER
S:If every of your wishes had a womb,
 :
 :And fertile every wish, a million.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
 :
 :ALEXAS  You think none but your sheets are privy to
 :your wishes.
 :
S:CHARMIAN, [to Soothsayer]  Nay, come. Tell Iras hers.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXAS  We'll know all our fortunes.
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight,
 :shall be--drunk to bed.
S:
 :
 :IRAS, [giving her hand to the Soothsayer]  There's a palm
 :
 :presages chastity, if nothing else.
 :
 :
S:CHARMIAN  E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth
 :
 :famine.
 :
 :
 :
 :IRAS  Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostica
 :tion,
S:I cannot scratch mine ear.--Prithee
 :
 :tell her but a workaday fortune.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER  Your fortunes are alike.
S:
 :
 :IRAS  But how, but how? Give me particulars.
 :
 :
 :
 :SOOTHSAYER  I have said.
 :
 :IRAS  Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Well, if you were but an inch of fortune
S:better than I, where would you choose it?
 :
 :
 :
 :IRAS  Not in my husband's nose.
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Our worser thoughts heavens mend. Alexas--
 :come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a
S:woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee, and
 :
 :let her die, too, and give him a worse, and let worse
 :
 :follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing
 :
S:to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold. Good Isis, hear me
 :
 :this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more
 :
 :weight, good Isis, I beseech thee!
 :
 :
 :IRAS  Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the
 :people. For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome
 :man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to
 :behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear
 :Isis, keep decorum and fortune him accordingly.
S:
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXAS  Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
S:cuckold, they would make themselves whores but
 :
 :they'd do 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Hush, here comes Antony.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Not he. The Queen.
 :
 :[Enter Cleopatra.]
 :
S:
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Saw you my lord?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  No, lady.
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  Was he not here?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  No, madam.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden
 :A Roman thought hath struck him.--Enobarbus!
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Madam?
S:
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Seek him and bring him hither.--Where's Alexas?
 :
S:
 :
 :ALEXAS
 :
 :Here at your service. My lord approaches.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Antony with a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :We will not look upon him. Go with us.
 :
 :[All but Antony and the Messenger exit.]
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
 :
 :ANTONY  Against my brother Lucius?
 :
S:
S:MESSENGER  Ay.
 :
 :But soon that war had end, and the time's state
 :
 :Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst
 :
 :Caesar,
 :Whose better issue in the war from Italy
 :Upon the first encounter drave them.
 :
 :ANTONY  Well, what worst?
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :The nature of bad news infects the teller.
 :
 :
S:ANTONY
 :
S:When it concerns the fool or coward. On.
 :
 :Things that are past are done, with me. 'Tis thus:
 :
 :Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
 :
 :I hear him as he flattered.
 :
 :MESSENGER  Labienus--
 :This is stiff news--hath with his Parthian force
 :Extended Asia: from Euphrates
 :His conquering banner shook, from Syria
S:
 :To Lydia and to Ionia,
 :
 :Whilst--
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  "Antony," thou wouldst say?
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER  O, my lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue.
 :Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome;
 :Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
 :With such full license as both truth and malice
 :Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
S:
 :When our quick winds lie still, and our ills told us
 :
 :Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  At your noble pleasure.	[Messenger exits.]
 :
S:[Enter another Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :From Sicyon how the news? Speak there.
 :
 :SECOND MESSENGER
 :The man from Sicyon--
 :
S:
 :ANTONY  Is there such an one?
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND MESSENGER
 :
 :He stays upon your will.
 :
S:ANTONY  Let him appear.
 :
 :[Second Messenger exits.]
 :
S:These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
 :
 :Or lose myself in dotage.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter another Messenger with a letter.]
 :
S:What are you?
 :
 :
 :
 :THIRD MESSENGER
 :
 :Fulvia thy wife is dead.
 :
 :ANTONY  Where died she?
 :
S:THIRD MESSENGER  In Sicyon.
 :
 :Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
 :
 :Importeth thee to know, this bears.
 :
 :[He hands Antony the letter.]
 :
 :ANTONY  Forbear me.
 :[Third Messenger exits.]
 :There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
 :What our contempts doth often hurl from us,
S:
S:We wish it ours again. The present pleasure,
 :
 :By revolution lowering, does become
 :
 :The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone.
 :
 :The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
 :I must from this enchanting queen break off.
 :Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
S:My idleness doth hatch.--How now, Enobarbus!
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Enobarbus.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  What's your pleasure, sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  I must with haste from hence.
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  Why then we kill all our women. We see
 :
 :how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer
 :
 :our departure, death's the word.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  I must be gone.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Under a compelling occasion, let women
 :die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing,
 :though between them and a great cause, they
S:
 :should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching
 :
 :but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen
 :
 :her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do
 :
S:think there is mettle in death which commits some
 :
 :loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in
 :
 :dying.
 :
 :
S:ANTONY  She is cunning past man's thought.
 :
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of
 :
 :nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot
 :
 :call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are
 :
 :greater storms and tempests than almanacs can
 :report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
 :makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
S:
 :
 :ANTONY  Would I had never seen her!
 :
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful
 :
 :piece of work, which not to have been blest
 :
 :withal would have discredited your travel.
 :
 :ANTONY  Fulvia is dead.
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Sir?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Fulvia is dead.
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Fulvia?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Dead.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
 :When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a
 :man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the
 :Earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are
S:
 :worn out, there are members to make new. If there
 :
S:were no more women but Fulvia, then had you
 :
 :indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief
 :
 :is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings
 :
 :forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an
 :onion that should water this sorrow.
S:
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :The business she hath broached in the state
 :
 :Cannot endure my absence.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  And the business you have broached here
 :cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra's,
 :which wholly depends on your abode.
 :
S:
S:ANTONY
 :
 :No more light answers. Let our officers
 :
S:Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
 :
 :The cause of our expedience to the Queen
 :
 :And get her leave to part. For not alone
 :
 :The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
S:Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too
 :
S:Of many our contriving friends in Rome
 :
 :Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
 :
S:Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands
 :
 :The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,
 :
 :Whose love is never linked to the deserver
 :
 :Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
 :Pompey the Great and all his dignities
 :Upon his son, who--high in name and power,
 :Higher than both in blood and life--stands up
 :For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
 :The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is
S:
 :breeding
 :
 :Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
 :
 :And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
 :
S:To such whose place is under us, requires
 :
 :Our quick remove from hence.
 :
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  I shall do 't.

 :
S:
 :CLEOPATRA  What should I do I do not?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN
 :
S:In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Thou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him.
 :
 :CHARMIAN
 :Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear.
 :In time we hate that which we often fear.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Antony.]
 :
 :
 :
 :But here comes Antony.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  I am sick and sullen.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose--
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.
 :It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
S:
 :Will not sustain it.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Now, my dearest queen--
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
S:Pray you stand farther from me.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  What's the matter?
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :I know by that same eye there's some good news.
 :
 :What, says the married woman you may go?
 :Would she had never given you leave to come.
 :Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here.
 :I have no power upon you. Hers you are.
 :
 :ANTONY
S:
 :The gods best know--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  O, never was there queen
 :
 :So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first
 :I saw the treasons planted.
 :
S:ANTONY  Cleopatra--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Why should I think you can be mine, and true--
 :Though you in swearing shake the throned gods--
S:Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
 :
 :To be entangled with those mouth-made vows
 :
 :Which break themselves in swearing!
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Most sweet
S:queen--
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Nay, pray you seek no color for your going,
 :
 :But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,
 :
 :Then was the time for words. No going then!
S:Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
 :
 :Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor
 :
 :But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
 :
 :Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
S:Art turned the greatest liar.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  How now, lady?
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
 :
 :There were a heart in Egypt.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Hear me, queen:
 :The strong necessity of time commands
 :Our services awhile, but my full heart
 :Remains in use with you. Our Italy
 :Shines o'er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
S:
 :Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
 :
 :Equality of two domestic powers
 :
 :Breed scrupulous faction; the hated grown to
 :
 :strength
 :Are newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,
 :Rich in his father's honor, creeps apace
 :Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
 :Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
S:
 :And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
 :
 :By any desperate change. My more particular,
 :
 :And that which most with you should safe my going,
 :
 :Is Fulvia's death.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
 :It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  She's dead, my queen.	[He shows her papers.]
 :
 :Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
 :
 :The garboils she awaked; at the last, best,
 :See when and where she died.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  O, most false love!
 :Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
S:
S:With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
 :
S:In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
 :The purposes I bear, which are or cease
 :As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
 :That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
S:Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
 :
 :As thou affects.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
 :But let it be; I am quickly ill and well;
 :So Antony loves.
 :
S:ANTONY  My precious queen, forbear,
 :
 :And give true evidence to his love, which stands
 :
 :An honorable trial.
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  So Fulvia told me.
 :
 :I prithee turn aside and weep for her,
 :
 :Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
 :
 :Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
S:Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
 :
 :Like perfect honor.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  You'll heat my blood. No more!
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
 :
 :ANTONY
S:
 :Now by my sword--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  And target. Still he mends.
 :
 :But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
S:How this Herculean Roman does become
 :
 :The carriage of his chafe.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTONY  I'll leave you, lady.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Courteous lord, one word.
 :
 :Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it;
 :Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
 :That you know well. Something it is I would--
 :O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
 :And I am all forgotten.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY  But that your Royalty
 :
 :Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
 :
 :For idleness itself.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  'Tis sweating labor
 :To bear such idleness so near the heart
 :As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,
 :Since my becomings kill me when they do not
S:
 :Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence;
 :
 :Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
 :
 :And all the gods go with you. Upon your sword
 :
 :Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
 :Be strewed before your feet.
 :
 :ANTONY  Let us go. Come.
S:Our separation so abides and flies
 :
 :That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
 :
 :And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
 :
 :Away!
 :[They exit.]

 :Scene 4
 :=======
 :[Enter Octavius Caesar, reading a letter,
S:
 :Lepidus, and their Train.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
 :It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
S:Our great competitor. From Alexandria
 :
 :This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
 :
 :The lamps of night in revel, is not more manlike
 :
 :Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
 :More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
 :Vouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall
 :find there
 :A man who is th' abstract of all faults
 :That all men follow.
S:
 :
 :
S:LEPIDUS  I must not think there are
 :
 :Evils enough to darken all his goodness.
 :
 :His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
 :
 :More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary
 :Rather than purchased, what he cannot change
S:Than what he chooses.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
 :Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
 :To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
S:And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
 :
 :To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
 :
 :With knaves that smells of sweat. Say this becomes
 :
S:him--
 :
 :As his composure must be rare indeed
 :
 :Whom these things cannot blemish--yet must
 :
 :Antony
 :No way excuse his foils when we do bear
 :So great weight in his lightness. If he filled
 :His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
 :Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
 :Call on him for 't. But to confound such time
S:
 :That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
 :
 :As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid
 :
 :As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
 :
 :Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
 :And so rebel to judgment.
 :
 :[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Here's more news.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
S:Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
 :
 :Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
 :
 :How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
 :
 :And it appears he is beloved of those
 :That only have feared Caesar. To the ports
 :The discontents repair, and men's reports
 :Give him much wronged.
 :
 :CAESAR  I should have known no less.
S:
 :It hath been taught us from the primal state
 :
S:That he which is was wished until he were,
 :
 :And the ebbed man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
 :
 :Comes feared by being lacked. This common body,
 :
 :Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
 :Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide
 :To rot itself with motion.
 :
 :[Enter a Second Messenger.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:SECOND MESSENGER  Caesar, I bring thee word
 :
 :Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
 :
 :Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and
 :
 :wound
S:With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
 :
 :They make in Italy--the borders maritime
 :
 :Lack blood to think on 't--and flush youth revolt.
 :
 :No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
 :Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more
 :Than could his war resisted.
 :
 :CAESAR  Antony,
 :Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
S:
 :Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
 :
 :Hirsius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
 :
 :Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
 :
 :Though daintily brought up, with patience more
 :Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
 :The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
S:Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did
 :
S:deign
 :
 :The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.
 :
 :Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
 :
 :The barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps
S:It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
 :
 :Which some did die to look on. And all this--
 :
S:It wounds thine honor that I speak it now--
 :
 :Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
 :
 :So much as lanked not.
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  'Tis pity of him.
 :
 :CAESAR  Let his shames quickly
S:Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
 :
 :Did show ourselves i' th' field, and to that end
 :
 :Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
 :
 :Thrives in our idleness.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Tomorrow, Caesar,
 :I shall be furnished to inform you rightly
S:Both what by sea and land I can be able
 :
 :To front this present time.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Till which encounter,
 :It is my business too. Farewell.
 :
 :LEPIDUS
 :Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
S:Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
 :
 :To let me be partaker.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Doubt not, sir. I knew it for my bond.

 :=======
 :[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Charmian!
 :
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Madam?
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Why, madam?
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :That I might sleep out this great gap of time
 :
S:My Antony is away.
 :
 :
 :
S:CHARMIAN  You think of him too much.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :O, 'tis treason!
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Madam, I trust not so.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
S:Thou, eunuch Mardian!
 :
 :
 :
 :MARDIAN  What's your Highness' pleasure?
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure
 :In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
 :That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts
 :May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
S:
 :
 :
 :MARDIAN  Yes, gracious madam.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Indeed?
 :
 :
 :
S:MARDIAN
 :
 :Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
 :
 :But what indeed is honest to be done.
 :
 :Yet have I fierce affections, and think
 :What Venus did with Mars.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  O, Charmian,
 :Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
 :Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
S:
 :O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
 :
S:Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou
 :
 :mov'st?
 :
 :The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm
 :
 :And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
 :Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile?"
 :For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
 :With most delicious poison. Think on me
 :That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
 :And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
S:
 :When thou wast here above the ground, I was
 :
 :A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey
 :
 :Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
 :
 :There would he anchor his aspect, and die
 :With looking on his life.
 :
 :[Enter Alexas from Antony.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXAS  Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
 :Yet coming from him, that great med'cine hath
 :With his tinct gilded thee.
 :How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
S:
 :
 :
S:ALEXAS  Last thing he did, dear queen,
 :
 :He kissed--the last of many doubled kisses--
 :
 :This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Mine ear must pluck it thence.
 :
 :ALEXAS  "Good friend," quoth
 :he,
S:
 :"Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
 :
 :This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
 :
 :To mend the petty present, I will piece
 :
 :Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
 :Say thou, shall call her mistress." So he nodded
S:And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
 :
 :Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke
 :
 :Was beastly dumbed by him.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  What, was he sad, or merry?
 :
 :ALEXAS
 :Like to the time o' th' year between th' extremes
 :Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :O, well-divided disposition!--Note him,
 :
S:Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man! But note
 :
 :him:
 :
 :He was not sad, for he would shine on those
 :
 :That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
S:Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay
 :
 :In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
 :
 :O, heavenly mingle!--Be'st thou sad or merry,
 :
 :The violence of either thee becomes,
 :So does it no man's else.--Met'st thou my posts?
 :
 :ALEXAS
 :Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
 :Why do you send so thick?
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Who's born that day
 :
 :When I forget to send to Antony
 :
 :Shall die a beggar.--Ink and paper, Charmian.--
S:Welcome, my good Alexas.--Did I, Charmian,
 :
 :Ever love Caesar so?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  O, that brave Caesar!
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Be choked with such another emphasis!
 :Say "the brave Antony."
 :
S:
 :CHARMIAN  The valiant Caesar!
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
 :If thou with Caesar paragon again
 :My man of men.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  By your most gracious pardon,
S:
S:I sing but after you.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  My salad days,
 :
 :When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
S:To say as I said then. But come, away,
 :
 :Get me ink and paper.
 :
 :He shall have every day a several greeting,
 :
 :Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

S:

 :If the great gods be just, they shall assist

S:
 :The people love me, and the sea is mine;
 :
 :My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
 :
 :Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
 :
S:In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
 :
 :No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
 :
S:He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
 :

 :
 :Nor either cares for him.
 :

 :Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
S:

 :
 :Where have you this? 'Tis false.
 :

 :
S:POMPEY
 :
 :He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
 :
 :Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
 :
 :Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!
S:Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
 :
 :Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts;
 :
 :Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
 :
 :Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
S:That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor
 :
 :Even till a Lethe'd dullness--

S:[Enter Varrius.]

 :This is most certain that I shall deliver:
 :Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
 :Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
 :A space for farther travel.
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  I could have given less matter
 :
 :A better ear.--Menas, I did not think
 :
 :This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm
S:For such a petty war. His soldiership
 :
 :Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
 :
S:The higher our opinion, that our stirring
 :
S:Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
 :
 :The ne'er lust-wearied Antony.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS  I cannot hope
 :Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
 :His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
 :His brother warred upon him, although I think
 :Not moved by Antony.
 :
S:
S:POMPEY  I know not, Menas,
 :
 :How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
 :
 :Were 't not that we stand up against them all,
 :
 :'Twere pregnant they should square between

 :For they have entertained cause enough
 :To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
 :May cement their divisions and bind up
S:The petty difference, we yet not know.

S:Be 't as our gods will have 't. It only stands

 :
 :LEPIDUS, [to Caesar and Antony]  Noble friends,
 :That which combined us was most great, and let not
 :A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
S:
 :May it be gently heard. When we debate

 :Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
 :
 :Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,

 :The rather for I earnestly beseech,
 :Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
S:Nor curstness grow to th' matter.

S:CAESAR  I must be laughed at

 :If or for nothing or a little, I
 :
 :Should say myself offended, and with you
 :
 :Chiefly i' th' world; more laughed at, that I should
 :Once name you derogately when to sound your

S:It not concerned me.

 :
S:My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was 't to you?
 :
S:
 :

 :
 :No more than my residing here at Rome

 :Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt
 :Might be my question.
 :
 :ANTONY  How intend you, practiced?
S:
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
S:You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
 :
 :By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
 :
 :Made wars upon me, and their contestation
 :
 :Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
 :
 :ANTONY
 :You do mistake your business. My brother never
 :Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
 :And have my learning from some true reports
S:
 :That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
 :
 :Discredit my authority with yours,
 :
 :And make the wars alike against my stomach,
 :
 :Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
 :Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
S:As matter whole you have to make it with,
 :
 :It must not be with this.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  You praise yourself
 :By laying defects of judgment to me; but
 :You patched up your excuses.
 :
 :ANTONY  Not so, not so.
 :I know you could not lack--I am certain on 't--
S:
 :Very necessity of this thought, that I,
 :
 :Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
 :
 :Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
 :
 :Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
 :I would you had her spirit in such another.
 :The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
 :You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
 :
S:
S:ENOBARBUS  Would we had all such wives, that the men
 :
 :might go to wars with the women!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTONY
 :
 :So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
 :
 :Made out of her impatience--which not wanted
 :
 :Shrewdness of policy too--I grieving grant
 :Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
 :But say I could not help it.
 :
 :CAESAR  I wrote to you
S:When rioting in Alexandria; you
 :
 :Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
 :
 :Did gibe my missive out of audience.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Sir,
 :He fell upon me ere admitted, then;
 :Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
 :Of what I was i' th' morning. But next day
 :I told him of myself, which was as much
S:
 :As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow
 :
 :Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
 :
 :Out of our question wipe him.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  You have broken
 :The article of your oath, which you shall never
 :Have tongue to charge me with.
S:
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Soft, Caesar!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  No, Lepidus, let him speak.
 :The honor is sacred which he talks on now,
 :Supposing that I lacked it.--But on, Caesar:
 :The article of my oath?
 :
 :CAESAR
S:
 :To lend me arms and aid when I required them,
 :
 :The which you both denied.
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTONY  Neglected, rather;
 :
 :And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
 :
 :From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may
 :
 :I'll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty
S:Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
 :
S:Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia,
 :
 :To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,
 :
 :For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
 :
 :So far ask pardon as befits mine honor
 :To stoop in such a case.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  'Tis noble spoken.
 :
 :MAECENAS
S:
 :If it might please you to enforce no further
 :
 :The griefs between you, to forget them quite
 :
 :Were to remember that the present need
 :
 :Speaks to atone you.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Or, if you borrow one another's love for
S:
 :the instant, you may, when you hear no more words
 :
 :of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to
 :
 :wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  That truth should be silent I had almost
S:
 :forgot.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  Go to, then. Your considerate stone.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :I do not much dislike the matter, but
 :
 :The manner of his speech; for 't cannot be
S:We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
 :
 :So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
 :
 :What hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to
 :
 :edge
 :O' th' world I would pursue it.
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Give me leave, Caesar.
 :
 :CAESAR  Speak, Agrippa.
S:
 :
 :
S:AGRIPPA
 :
 :Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
 :
 :Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony
 :
 :Is now a widower.
S:
 :
 :CAESAR  Say not so, Agrippa.
 :
 :If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
 :
 :Were well deserved of rashness.
 :
 :ANTONY
S:I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
 :
 :Agrippa further speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA
 :To hold you in perpetual amity,
 :To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
S:With an unslipping knot, take Antony
 :
 :Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims
 :
 :No worse a husband than the best of men;
 :
 :Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
 :That which none else can utter. By this marriage
 :All little jealousies, which now seem great,
S:And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
 :
 :Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
 :
 :Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both
 :
 :Would each to other and all loves to both
 :Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
 :For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
 :By duty ruminated.
 :
S:ANTONY  Will Caesar speak?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Not till he hears how Antony is touched
 :With what is spoke already.
 :
 :ANTONY  What power is in Agrippa,
 :If I would say "Agrippa, be it so,"
 :To make this good?
S:
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  The power of Caesar, and
 :
 :His power unto Octavia.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  May I never
 :To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
 :Dream of impediment. Let me have thy hand.
 :Further this act of grace; and from this hour
S:
 :The heart of brothers govern in our loves
 :
 :And sway our great designs.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  There's my hand.
 :[They clasp hands.]
 :A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
 :Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
 :To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
S:
 :Fly off our loves again.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Happily, amen!
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,
 :For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
 :Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
S:
 :Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
 :
 :At heel of that, defy him.
 :
S:
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Time calls upon 's.
 :
 :Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
 :
 :Or else he seeks out us.
 :
S:ANTONY  Where lies he?
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  About the Mount Misena.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  What is his strength by land?
 :
S:CAESAR  Great and increasing;
 :
 :But by sea he is an absolute master.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  So is the fame.
 :Would we had spoke together. Haste we for it.
 :Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
 :The business we have talked of.
 :
 :CAESAR  With most gladness,
S:
 :And do invite you to my sister's view,
 :
 :Whither straight I'll lead you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.
S:
 :
 :LEPIDUS
 :
 :Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.
 :
 :[Flourish. All but Enobarbus, Agrippa, and
 :Maecenas exit.]
 :
 :MAECENAS, [to Enobarbus]  Welcome from Egypt, sir.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Half the heart of Caesar, worthy
S:
 :Maecenas!--My honorable friend Agrippa!
 :
S:
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Good Enobarbus!
 :
 :
 :
 :MAECENAS  We have cause to be glad that matters are so
 :well digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance
 :and made the night light with drinking.
 :
S:
 :MAECENAS  Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast,
 :
 :and but twelve persons there. Is this true?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had
 :much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily
 :deserved noting.
S:
 :
 :MAECENAS  She's a most triumphant lady, if report be
 :
 :square to her.
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  When she first met Mark Antony, she
S:pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  There she appeared indeed, or my reporter
 :
 :devised well for her.
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  I will tell you.
 :
 :The barge she sat in like a burnished throne
 :
 :Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,
 :
 :Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
 :The winds were lovesick with them. The oars were
S:silver,
 :
 :Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
 :
 :The water which they beat to follow faster,
 :
 :As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
 :It beggared all description: she did lie
 :In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold, of tissue--
 :O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
 :The fancy outwork nature. On each side her
S:Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
 :
 :With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem
 :
 :To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
 :
 :And what they undid did.
S:
 :
 :AGRIPPA  O, rare for Antony!
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
 :Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
 :So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
 :And made their bends adornings. At the helm
 :A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
 :Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
S:
 :That yarely frame the office. From the barge
 :
 :A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
 :
S:Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
 :
 :Her people out upon her; and Antony,
 :
 :Enthroned i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
 :
 :Whistling to th' air, which but for vacancy
 :Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
 :And made a gap in nature.
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Rare Egyptian!
 :
S:
 :ENOBARBUS
 :
 :Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
 :
 :Invited her to supper. She replied
 :
 :It should be better he became her guest,
S:Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
 :
 :Whom ne'er the word of "No" woman heard speak,
 :
 :Being barbered ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
 :
 :And for his ordinary pays his heart
S:For what his eyes eat only.
 :
 :
 :
S:AGRIPPA  Royal wench!
 :
 :She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;
 :
 :He ploughed her, and she cropped.
 :
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  I saw her once
 :
 :Hop forty paces through the public street,
 :
S:And having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,
 :
 :That she did make defect perfection,
 :
 :And breathless pour breath forth.
 :
 :
S:MAECENAS
 :
 :Now Antony must leave her utterly.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Never. He will not.
S:Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
 :
 :Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
 :
 :The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
 :
 :Where most she satisfies. For vilest things
 :Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
 :Bless her when she is riggish.
 :
 :MAECENAS
 :If beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle
S:
S:The heart of Antony, Octavia is
 :
 :A blessed lottery to him.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Let us go.
 :Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
 :Whilst you abide here.
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  Humbly, sir, I thank you.

S:ANTONY
 :
S:The world and my great office will sometimes
 :
 :Divide me from your bosom.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIA  All which time
 :Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers

S:Good night, sir.
 :
 :

 :Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
S:

S:nor you thither.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONY  If you can, your reason?

S:SOOTHSAYER  I see it in my motion, have it not in my

 :
 :Caesar's or mine?
 :
S:
 :
S:SOOTHSAYER  Caesar's.
 :
 :Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
 :
 :Thy daemon--that thy spirit which keeps thee--is
 :
 :Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
 :Where Caesar's is not. But near him, thy angel
 :Becomes afeard, as being o'erpowered. Therefore
 :Make space enough between you.
 :
 :ANTONY  Speak this no more.
S:
 :

 :SOOTHSAYER
 :
 :To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
 :
 :If thou dost play with him at any game,
S:Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
 :
 :He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy luster thickens
 :
 :When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
 :
 :Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
S:But he away, 'tis noble.
 :

 :ANTONY  Get thee gone.

S:Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
 :
 :[Soothsayer exits.]
 :
 :He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
 :
 :He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him,
 :And in our sports my better cunning faints
 :Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
 :His cocks do win the battle still of mine
 :When it is all to naught, and his quails ever
 :Beat mine, inhooped, at odds. I will to Egypt.
S:
S:And though I make this marriage for my peace,

S:

S:CHARMIAN
 :
 :My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.

S:As well a woman with an eunuch played
 :
 :As with a woman.--Come, you'll play with me, sir?
 :
 :
 :

 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :And when good will is showed, though 't come too

 :The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
S:
 :Give me mine angle; we'll to th' river. There,
 :
 :My music playing far off, I will betray
 :
 :Tawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce
 :
 :Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up
 :I'll think them every one an Antony
 :And say "Aha! You're caught."
 :
 :CHARMIAN  'Twas merry when
S:
 :You wagered on your angling; when your diver
 :
 :Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
 :
 :With fervency drew up.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  That time?--O, times!--
S:I laughed him out of patience; and that night
 :
 :I laughed him into patience; and next morn,
 :
S:Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
 :
 :Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst

S:[Enter a Messenger.]
 :
 :
 :
 :O, from Italy!
 :
 :Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
 :That long time have been barren.
 :
 :MESSENGER  Madam, madam--
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Antonio's dead! If thou say so, villain,
 :
 :Thou kill'st thy mistress. But well and free,
 :
 :If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
 :My bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings
 :Have lipped and trembled kissing.
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER  First, madam, he is well.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Why, there's more gold. But sirrah, mark, we use
 :To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
 :The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
 :Down thy ill-uttering throat.
 :
S:
 :MESSENGER  Good madam, hear me.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Well, go to, I will.
 :
 :But there's no goodness in thy face--if Antony
 :
 :Be free and healthful, so tart a favor
S:To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
 :
 :Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes,
 :
 :Not like a formal man.
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  Will 't please you hear me?
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
 :Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
S:
 :Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him,
 :
 :I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail
 :
 :Rich pearls upon thee.
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  Madam, he's well.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Well said.
 :
S:
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :And friends with Caesar.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Th' art an honest man.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Make thee a fortune from me.
 :
S:
 :MESSENGER  But yet, madam--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :I do not like "But yet." It does allay
 :The good precedence. Fie upon "But yet."
 :"But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth
S:Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
 :
 :Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
 :
 :The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar,
 :
 :In state of health, thou say'st, and, thou say'st, free.
 :
 :MESSENGER
S:Free, madam, no. I made no such report.
 :
 :He's bound unto Octavia.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  For what good turn?
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :For the best turn i' th' bed.

 :
 :CLEOPATRA  What say you?	[Strikes him.]
 :Hence, horrible villain, or I'll spurn thine eyes
S:
 :Like balls before me! I'll unhair thy head!
 :
 :[She hales him up and down.]
 :
 :Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in
 :
S:brine,
 :
 :Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  Gracious madam,
 :I that do bring the news made not the match.
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee
 :
 :And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
 :
 :Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
 :And I will boot thee with what gift beside
 :Thy modesty can beg.
 :
 :MESSENGER  He's married, madam.
 :
S:

 :
 :Rogue, thou hast lived too long.	[Draw a knife.]
 :
 :

 :MESSENGER  Nay then, I'll run.
 :What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :CHARMIAN
S:
 :Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.
 :
 :The man is innocent.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
 :Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures
S:Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
 :
S:Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN
 :
 :He is afeard to come.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  I will not hurt him.
S:These hands do lack nobility that they strike
 :
 :A meaner than myself, since I myself
 :
 :Have given myself the cause.
 :
 :
 :[Enter the Messenger again.]
 :
 :Come hither, sir.
 :Though it be honest, it is never good
 :To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
S:
 :An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
 :
 :Themselves when they be felt.
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  I have done my duty.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Is he married?
 :I cannot hate thee worser than I do
 :If thou again say "yes."
S:
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER  He's married, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :Should I lie, madam?
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  O, I would thou didst,
 :
 :So half my Egypt were submerged and made
 :
 :A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence.
 :Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
S:Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
 :
 :
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :I crave your Highness' pardon.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  He is married?
S:
 :
 :MESSENGER
 :
 :Take no offense that I would not offend you.
 :
 :To punish me for what you make me do
 :Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
 :
 :That art not what th' art sure of! Get thee hence.
 :The merchandise which thou hast brought from
 :Rome
 :Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
S:And be undone by 'em!	[Messenger exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Good your Highness,
 :
 :patience.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Many times, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :I am paid for 't now. Lead me from hence;
 :I faint. O, Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.--
 :Go to the fellow, good Alexas. Bid him
 :Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
 :Her inclination; let him not leave out
S:
 :The color of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
 :
 :[Alexas exits.]
 :
S:Let him forever go--let him not, Charmian.
 :
 :Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
 :
 :The other way 's a Mars. [(To Mardian.)] Bid you

 :Bring me word how tall she is.--Pity me,
 :Charmian,
S:But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

 :Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
 :Wherefore my father should revengers want,
S:
 :Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
 :
 :Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
 :
 :There saw you laboring for him. What was 't
 :
 :That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what
 :Made the all-honored, honest, Roman Brutus,
 :With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous
 :freedom,
 :To drench the Capitol, but that they would
S:
 :Have one man but a man? And that is it
 :
S:Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
 :
 :The angered ocean foams, with which I meant
 :
 :To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
 :
 :Cast on my noble father.
 :
 :CAESAR  Take your time.
 :
 :ANTONY
S:Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.
 :
 :We'll speak with thee at sea. At land thou know'st
 :
 :How much we do o'ercount thee.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  At land indeed
 :Thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house;
 :But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
 :Remain in 't as thou mayst.
 :
S:
 :LEPIDUS  Be pleased to tell us--
 :
 :For this is from the present--how you take
 :
 :The offers we have sent you.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  There's the point.
 :
 :ANTONY
S:Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
 :
 :What it is worth embraced.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  And what may follow
 :To try a larger fortune.
 :
 :POMPEY  You have made me offer
 :Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
 :Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
S:
 :Measures of wheat to Rome. This 'greed upon,
 :
 :To part with unhacked edges and bear back
 :
 :Our targes undinted.
 :
 :
 :ALL  That's our offer.
 :
 :POMPEY  Know then
 :I came before you here a man prepared
S:
 :To take this offer. But Mark Antony
 :
 :Put me to some impatience.--Though I lose
 :
 :The praise of it by telling, you must know
 :
 :When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
 :Your mother came to Sicily and did find
 :Her welcome friendly.
 :
 :ANTONY  I have heard it, Pompey,
S:
 :And am well studied for a liberal thanks,
 :
 :Which I do owe you.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Let me have your hand.
 :
 :[They clasp hands.]
 :
 :I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
S:The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
 :
 :That called me timelier than my purpose hither,
 :
 :For I have gained by 't.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR, [to Pompey]  Since I saw you last,
 :
S:There's a change upon you.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Well, I know not
 :
 :What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,
 :But in my bosom shall she never come
 :To make my heart her vassal.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Well met here.
 :
S:
 :POMPEY
 :
S:I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
 :
 :I crave our composition may be written
 :
 :And sealed between us.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  That's the next to do.
 :
 :POMPEY
 :We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
 :Draw lots who shall begin.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  That will I, Pompey.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY
 :
 :No, Antony, take the lot. But, first or last,
 :
 :Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have
 :
 :The fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
 :Grew fat with feasting there.
 :
 :ANTONY  You have heard much.
 :
 :POMPEY  I have fair meanings, sir.
S:
 :
 :
S:ANTONY  And fair words to them.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Then so much have I heard.
 :
 :And I have heard Apollodorus carried--
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
S:No more of that. He did so.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  What, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
 :
 :A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
 :
 :POMPEY
S:I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Well,
 :
 :And well am like to do, for I perceive
S:Four feasts are toward.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Let me shake thy hand.
 :
 :I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight
S:When I have envied thy behavior.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Sir,
 :
 :I never loved you much, but I ha' praised you
S:When you have well deserved ten times as much
 :
 :As I have said you did.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Enjoy thy plainness;
 :It nothing ill becomes thee.--
 :Aboard my galley I invite you all.
 :Will you lead, lords?
 :
 :ALL  Show 's the way, sir.
S:
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Come.
 :
 :[They exit, except for Enobarbus and Menas.]
 :
S:
 :
 :MENAS, [aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
 :
 :made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  At sea, I think.
 :
 :MENAS  We have, sir.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  You have done well by water.
S:
 :
 :
S:MENAS  And you by land.
 :
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  I will praise any man that will praise me,
 :
 :though it cannot be denied what I have done by
 :
 :land.
 :
 :
 :MENAS  Nor what I have done by water.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Yes, something you can deny for your own
 :safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
S:
 :
 :MENAS  And you by land.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  There I deny my land service. But give me
S:your hand, Menas. [They clasp hands.] If our eyes
 :
 :had authority, here they might take two thieves
 :
 :kissing.
 :
 :
 :MENAS  All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their
 :hands are.
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  But there is never a fair woman has a true
 :
 :face.
 :
 :
 :MENAS  No slander. They steal hearts.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  We came hither to fight with you.
 :
 :MENAS  For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a
S:
 :drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his
 :
 :fortune.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  If he do, sure he cannot weep 't back
 :again.
 :
 :MENAS  You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
 :here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
S:
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
 :
 :
 :
S:MENAS  True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  But she is now the wife of Marcus
 :
S:Antonius.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS  Pray you, sir?
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  'Tis true.
 :
 :MENAS  Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  If I were bound to divine of this unity, I
 :
 :would not prophesy so.
 :
 :
 :MENAS  I think the policy of that purpose made more in
 :the marriage than the love of the parties.
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  I think so, too. But you shall find the band
 :
 :that seems to tie their friendship together will be
 :
 :the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy,
 :
 :cold, and still conversation.
 :
 :MENAS  Who would not have his wife so?
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Not he that himself is not so, which is
 :Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again.
S:
 :Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in
 :
 :Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the
 :
S:strength of their amity shall prove the immediate
 :
 :author of their variance. Antony will use his affection
 :
 :where it is. He married but his occasion here.
 :
 :
 :MENAS  And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
 :I have a health for you.
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats
 :
 :in Egypt.
 :
 :
S:MENAS  Come, let's away.
 :
 :[They exit.]

 :Scene 7
 :=======
 :[Music plays. Enter two or three Servants
 :with a banquet.]
 :
 :
S:
 :FIRST SERVANT  Here they'll be, man. Some o' their
 :
 :plants are ill-rooted already. The least wind i' th'
 :
 :world will blow them down.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND SERVANT  Lepidus is high-colored.
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST SERVANT  They have made him drink alms-drink.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND SERVANT  As they pinch one another by the
 :
 :disposition, he cries out "No more," reconciles
 :
 :them to his entreaty and himself to th' drink.
 :
S:FIRST SERVANT  But it raises the greater war between
 :
 :him and his discretion.
 :
S:
 :
 :SECOND SERVANT  Why, this it is to have a name in great
 :
 :men's fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will
 :
 :do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
 :
S:FIRST SERVANT  To be called into a huge sphere, and not
 :
 :to be seen to move in 't, are the holes where eyes
 :
 :should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
 :
 :
S:[A sennet sounded. Enter Caesar, Antony, Pompey,
 :
 :Lepidus, Agrippa, Maecenas, Enobarbus, Menas, with
 :
 :other Captains and a Boy.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th' Nile
 :By certain scales i' th' Pyramid; they know
 :By th' height, the lowness, or the mean if dearth
S:
 :Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells,
 :
 :The more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman
 :
 :Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
 :
 :And shortly comes to harvest.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  You've strange serpents there?
S:
 :
 :ANTONY  Ay, Lepidus.
 :
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your
 :mud by the operation of your sun; so is your
S:crocodile.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  They are so.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY
S:Sit, and some wine. A health to Lepidus!
 :
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er
 :
 :out.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS, [aside]  Not till you have slept. I fear me
 :you'll be in till then.
 :
 :LEPIDUS  Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
S:
 :pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction
 :
 :I have heard that.
 :
S:
 :
 :MENAS, [aside to Pompey]
 :
 :Pompey, a word.
 :
 :
S:POMPEY, [aside to Menas]  Say in mine ear what is 't.
 :
 :
 :
S:MENAS [(whispers in 's ear)]
 :
 :Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,
 :
S:And hear me speak a word.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY, [aside to Menas]
 :
 :Forbear me till anon.--This wine for Lepidus!
S:
 :
 :LEPIDUS  What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad a
 :s
 :it hath breadth. It is just so high as it is, and moves
 :with it own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth
 :it, and the elements once out of it, it
 :transmigrates.
S:
 :
 :
 :LEPIDUS  What color is it of?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Of it own color too.
S:
 :
 :LEPIDUS  'Tis a strange serpent.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  'Tis so, and the tears of it are wet.
 :
 :CAESAR, [aside to Antony]  Will this description satisfy
S:him?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  With the health that Pompey gives him, else he
 :
 :is a very epicure.
 :
 :POMPEY, [aside to Menas]
S:Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? Away!
 :
 :Do as I bid you.--Where's this cup I called for?
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS, [aside to Pompey]
 :If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,
 :Rise from thy stool.
 :
 :POMPEY  I think th' art mad!
S:[He rises, and they walk aside.]
 :
 :The matter?
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS
S:I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY
 :
 :Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else
 :to say?--
 :Be jolly, lords.
 :
 :ANTONY  These quicksands, Lepidus,
 :Keep off them, for you sink.
S:
 :
 :
 :MENAS, [aside to Pompey]
 :
S:Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
 :
S:
 :
 :POMPEY  What sayst thou?
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS
 :Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
 :
 :POMPEY  How should that be?
 :
 :MENAS  But entertain it,
S:
 :And though thou think me poor, I am the man
 :
 :Will give thee all the world.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Hast thou drunk well?
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS
 :
 :No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
 :Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove.
 :Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
S:Is thine, if thou wilt ha 't.
 :
 :
 :
S:POMPEY  Show me which way.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS
 :
 :These three world-sharers, these competitors,
S:Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable,
 :
 :And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
 :
 :All there is thine.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Ah, this thou shouldst have done
 :And not have spoke on 't! In me 'tis villainy;
 :In thee 't had been good service. Thou must know
 :'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor;
 :Mine honor, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
S:
S:Hath so betrayed thine act. Being done unknown,
 :
 :I should have found it afterwards well done,
 :
 :But must condemn it now. Desist and drink.
 :
S:
 :
 :MENAS, [aside]  For this
 :
 :I'll never follow thy palled fortunes more.
 :
 :Who seeks and will not take when once 'tis offered
 :Shall never find it more.
 :
 :POMPEY  This health to Lepidus!
S:
 :
 :ANTONY, [to Servant]
 :
 :Bear him ashore.--I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
S:Here's to thee, Menas.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS  Enobarbus, welcome.
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Fill till the cup be hid.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS, [pointing to the Servant carrying Lepidus]
 :There's a strong fellow, Menas.
 :
S:
 :MENAS  Why?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  He bears
 :
 :The third part of the world, man. Seest not?
 :
 :MENAS
 :The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
 :That it might go on wheels.
S:
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Drink thou. Increase the reels.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS  Come.
 :
 :POMPEY
 :This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
 :
 :Here's to Caesar.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  I could well forbear 't.
 :It's monstrous labor when I wash my brain
 :And it grows fouler.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY  Be a child o' th' time.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Possess it, I'll make answer.
 :
 :But I had rather fast from all, four days,
 :Than drink so much in one.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS, [to Antony]  Ha, my brave emperor,
 :Shall we dance now the Egyptian bacchanals
S:
 :And celebrate our drink?
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  Let's ha 't, good soldier.
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Come, let's all take hands
 :Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our
 :sense
 :In soft and delicate Lethe.
S:
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS  All take hands.
 :
 :Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
 :
 :The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing.
 :
 :The holding every man shall beat as loud
 :As his strong sides can volley.
 :
S:[Music plays. Enobarbus places them hand in hand.]
 :
 :
 :
 :The Song.
 :
 :
 :BOY	Come, thou monarch of the vine,
 :Plumpy Bacchus, with pink eyne.
 :In thy vats our cares be drowned.
 :With thy grapes our hairs be crowned.
S:
 :
 :ALL	Cup us till the world go round,
 :
S:Cup us till the world go round.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
S:What would you more?--Pompey, goodnight.--
 :
 :Good brother,
 :
 :Let me request you off. Our graver business
 :
 :Frowns at this levity.--Gentle lords, let's part.
 :You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
 :Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
 :Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
 :Anticked us all. What needs more words?
 :Goodnight.
S:
 :Good Antony, your hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY  I'll try you on the shore.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONY  And shall, sir. Give 's your hand.
 :
 :
 :
 :POMPEY
 :O, Antony, you have my father's house.
 :But what? We are friends! Come down into the boat.
 :
S:ENOBARBUS
 :
 :Take heed you fall not.
 :
S:[All but Menas and Enobarbus exit.]
 :
 :Menas, I'll not on shore.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENAS
 :No, to my cabin. These drums, these trumpets,
 :flutes! What!
S:Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
 :
 :To these great fellows. Sound and be hanged. Sound
 :
 :out!	[Sound a flourish, with drums.]
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Hoo, says 'a! There's my cap!
 :[He throws his cap in the air.]
 :
 :MENAS  Hoo! Noble captain, come.

S:VENTIDIUS
 :
 :Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now

 :Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
 :Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,

 :Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
S:
 :The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,
 :
S:Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
 :
 :The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
 :
S:Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
 :
 :Put garlands on thy head.
 :
 :
 :
 :VENTIDIUS  O, Silius, Silius,
 :I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
 :May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:
 :Better to leave undone than by our deed
 :Acquire too high a fame when him we serve 's away.
 :Caesar and Antony have ever won
S:
 :More in their officer than person. Sossius,
 :
 :One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
 :
 :For quick accumulation of renown,
 :
 :Which he achieved by th' minute, lost his favor.
 :Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
 :Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
 :The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
S:Than gain which darkens him.
 :
 :I could do more to do Antonius good,
 :
 :But 'twould offend him. And in his offense
 :
 :Should my performance perish.

 :[Enter Agrippa at one door, Enobarbus at another.]
 :
 :
S:AGRIPPA  What, are the brothers parted?
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
 :
 :They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.
 :The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
 :To part from Rome. Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,
S:Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
 :
 :With the greensickness.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  'Tis a noble Lepidus.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
S:A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA
 :
 :Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
S:Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA
 :
 :What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
 :

S:Spake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil!
 :

 :O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
S:Would you praise Caesar, say "Caesar." Go no
 :
 :further.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA
S:Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
 :
 :
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
 :
 :But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony.
 :Hoo, hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets,
 :cannot
 :Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number--hoo!--
 :His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
S:Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Both he loves.

 :They are his shards and he their beetle.

S:

 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :You take from me a great part of myself.
 :
S:Use me well in 't.--Sister, prove such a wife
 :
 :As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bond
 :
 :Shall pass on thy approof.--Most noble Antony,
 :
 :Let not the piece of virtue which is set
S:Betwixt us, as the cement of our love
 :
 :To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
 :
 :The fortress of it. For better might we
 :
 :Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
 :This be not cherished.
 :
S:ANTONY  Make me not offended
 :
 :In your distrust.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  I have said.
 :
S:ANTONY  You shall not find,
 :
 :Though you be therein curious, the least cause
 :
 :For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
 :
 :And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.
 :We will here part.
S:

 :
S:Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
 :
S:The elements be kind to thee and make
 :
 :Thy spirits all of comfort. Fare thee well.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIA  My noble brother.	[She weeps.]
 :
 :ANTONY
 :The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
 :And these the showers to bring it on.--Be cheerful.
 :
S:
 :OCTAVIA, [to Caesar]
 :
 :Sir, look well to my husband's house, and--
 :
 :

 :What, Octavia?

S:

 :What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
 :If e'er thou looked'st on majesty.
 :
 :MESSENGER  She creeps.
 :Her motion and her station are as one.

S:
 :A statue than a breather.

S:

 :Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is 't long or round?

 :For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.

 :As low as she would wish it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA, [giving money]  There's gold for thee.

 :Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.

S:

 :
S:This creature's no such thing.

S:
 :

 :Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that--
 :That were excusable, that and thousands more
 :Of semblable import--but he hath waged
 :New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will and read it
S:
 :To public ear;
 :

 :
S:He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;

 :
 :OCTAVIA  O, my good lord,
 :Believe not all, or if you must believe,
S:Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
 :
 :If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
 :
 :Praying for both parts.
 :
 :The good gods will mock me presently
 :When I shall pray "O, bless my lord and husband!"

S:"O, bless my brother!" Husband win, win brother

 :Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
S:Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honor,
 :
 :I lose myself; better I were not yours
 :
 :Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,

 :Yourself shall go between 's. The meantime, lady,

 :
 :OCTAVIA  Thanks to my lord.
S:
 :The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,

 :

S:When it appears to you where this begins,

S:
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
 :
S:In Alexandria. Here's the manner of 't:
 :
 :I' th' marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,
 :
S:Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
 :
 :Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat
 :
S:Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
 :
 :And all the unlawful issue that their lust
 :
 :Since then hath made between them. Unto her
 :
 :He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
 :Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
 :Absolute queen.
 :
 :MAECENAS  This in the public eye?
 :
S:
 :CAESAR
 :
 :I' th' common showplace where they exercise.
 :
 :His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings.
 :
 :Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
 :He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned
S:Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
 :
 :In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
 :
S:That day appeared, and oft before gave audience,
 :
 :As 'tis reported, so.
 :
 :
 :
 :MAECENAS  Let Rome be thus informed.
 :
 :AGRIPPA
 :Who, queasy with his insolence already,
 :Will their good thoughts call from him.
 :
S:
 :CAESAR
 :
 :The people knows it and have now received
 :
 :His accusations.
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Who does he accuse?
 :
 :CAESAR
 :Caesar, and that, having in Sicily
S:
 :Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him
 :
 :His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
 :
 :Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets
 :
S:That Lepidus of the triumvirate
 :
 :Should be deposed and, being, that we detain
 :
S:All his revenue.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGRIPPA  Sir, this should be answered.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
S:'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
 :
S:I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
 :
 :That he his high authority abused
 :
 :And did deserve his change. For what I have
 :
 :conquered,
 :I grant him part; but then in his Armenia
 :And other of his conquered kingdoms I
 :Demand the like.
 :
 :MAECENAS  He'll never yield to that.
S:

S:CAESAR

S:
 :
 :OCTAVIA
 :
 :You have not called me so, nor have you cause.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR
 :
 :Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
 :
 :Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
 :Should have an army for an usher and
 :The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
 :Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
S:Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
 :
S:Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
 :
 :Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
 :
 :Raised by your populous troops. But you are come
 :
 :A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
S:The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
 :
 :Is often left unloved. We should have met you
 :
 :By sea and land, supplying every stage
 :
 :With an augmented greeting.
 :
 :OCTAVIA  Good my lord,
 :To come thus was I not constrained, but did it
 :On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
S:Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
 :
 :My grieved ear withal, whereon I begged
 :
 :His pardon for return.
 :
 :
S:CAESAR  Which soon he granted,
 :
S:Being an abstract 'tween his lust and him.
 :
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIA
 :
S:Do not say so, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
S:CAESAR  I have eyes upon him,
 :
 :And his affairs come to me on the wind.
 :
 :Where is he now?
 :
 :
 :OCTAVIA  My lord, in Athens.
 :
 :CAESAR
 :No, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra
 :Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
S:
 :Up to a whore, who now are levying
 :
 :The kings o' th' Earth for war. He hath assembled
 :
 :Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus
 :
S:Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
 :

 :
 :King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;

 :With a more larger list of scepters.
 :
 :OCTAVIA  Ay me, most wretched,
S:
 :That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
 :
 :That does afflict each other!
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Welcome hither.
 :Your letters did withhold our breaking forth
 :Till we perceived both how you were wrong led
 :And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart.
 :Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
S:
 :O'er your content these strong necessities,
 :
S:But let determined things to destiny
 :
 :Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome,
 :
 :Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
 :
 :Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
 :To do you justice, makes his ministers
 :Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
 :And ever welcome to us.
 :
S:AGRIPPA  Welcome, lady.
 :
 :
 :
 :MAECENAS  Welcome, dear madam.
 :
 :Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
 :Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
 :In his abominations, turns you off
 :And gives his potent regiment to a trull
 :That noises it against us.
 :
S:
 :OCTAVIA, [to Caesar]  Is it so, sir?
 :
 :

 :
 :Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you

 :Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off,
 :And so should you.
S:
S:
 :
 :ENOBARBUS  Your ships are not well manned,

 :
S:ENOBARBUS  How appears the fight?
 :
 :
 :
 :SCARUS
 :
 :On our side, like the tokened pestilence,
 :Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,
 :Whom leprosy o'ertake, i' th' midst o' th' fight,
 :When vantage like a pair of twins appeared
S:Both as the same--or, rather, ours the elder--
 :
S:The breeze upon her like a cow in June,
 :
 :Hoists sails and flies.
 :
 :

 :ENOBARBUS  That I beheld.
S:Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
 :

 :
 :
S:SCARUS  She once being loofed,
 :
S:The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
 :
 :Claps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard,
 :
 :Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
 :
 :I never saw an action of such shame.
 :Experience, manhood, honor ne'er before
 :Did violate so itself.

 :ENOBARBUS  Alack, alack.

S:CANIDIUS
 :
 :Our fortune on the sea is out of breath
 :

 :
 :Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
 :O, he has given example for our flight
 :Most grossly by his own.

S:Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon 't.
 :
S:It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.

S:I am so lated in the world that I

S:I have myself resolved upon a course
 :
 :Which has no need of you. Begone.
 :
 :My treasure's in the harbor; take it. O,
 :
 :I followed that I blush to look upon!
 :My very hairs do mutiny, for the white
 :Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
 :For fear and doting. Friends, begone. You shall
 :Have letters from me to some friends that will
 :Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
S:
 :Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint
 :
S:Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
 :
 :Which leaves itself. To the seaside straightway!
 :
S:I will possess you of that ship and treasure.

 :Leave me, I pray, a little--pray you, now,

S:Nay, do so--for indeed I have lost command.

 :Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
S:His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck

 :Command me.
S:

S:CLEOPATRA  O, my pardon!
 :

 :
 :ANTONY  Now I must
 :
 :To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
 :And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
 :With half the bulk o' th' world played as I pleased,
 :Making and marring fortunes. You did know
 :How much you were my conqueror, and that
 :My sword, made weak by my affection, would
S:
 :Obey it on all cause.

S:CAESAR  Be 't so. Declare thine office.

 :
 :AMBASSADOR
 :
 :Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
 :Requires to live in Egypt, which not granted,

S:ENOBARBUS, [aside]

S:Unstate his happiness and be staged to th' show
 :
 :Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
 :
 :A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
 :
 :Do draw the inward quality after them
 :To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
S:Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
 :

 :So haply are they friends to Antony.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS
 :He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
 :Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
S:
 :Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know

 :Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
 :

 :THIDIAS  So.--

S:
 :CLEOPATRA  Go on; right royal.

 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  O!
S:
 :
 :THIDIAS
 :
 :The scars upon your honor therefore he
 :
 :Does pity as constrained blemishes,
 :Not as deserved.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  He is a god and knows
 :
 :What is most right. Mine honor was not yielded,
 :
 :But conquered merely.
 :
 :ENOBARBUS, [aside]  To be sure of that,
S:I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
 :
 :That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
 :
 :Thy dearest quit thee.	[Enobarbus exits.]
 :
 :
 :THIDIAS  Shall I say to Caesar
S:What you require of him? For he partly begs
 :
 :To be desired to give. It much would please him
 :
S:That of his fortunes you should make a staff
 :
 :To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
 :
 :To hear from me you had left Antony
 :
 :And put yourself under his shroud,
 :The universal landlord.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  What's your name?
 :
 :THIDIAS
S:
 :My name is Thidias.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Most kind messenger,
 :
S:Say to great Caesar this in deputation:
 :
 :I kiss his conqu'ring hand. Tell him I am prompt
 :
 :To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
 :
 :Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear
S:The doom of Egypt.
 :

 :
 :THIDIAS  'Tis your noblest course.
 :
 :Wisdom and fortune combating together,
 :If that the former dare but what it can,
 :No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
 :My duty on your hand.
 :[She gives him her hand to kiss.]
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Your Caesar's father oft,
 :
 :When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
 :
 :Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place
 :As it rained kisses.

 :
 :Approach there!--Ah, you kite!--Now, gods and

 :Ha!

 :By one that looks on feeders?

 :But when we in our viciousness grow hard--

S:CLEOPATRA  O, is 't come to this?

 :I found you as a morsel cold upon
S:Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
 :
 :Of Gneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
 :
 :Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have
 :
 :Luxuriously picked out. For I am sure,
S:Though you can guess what temperance should be,
 :
 :You know not what it is.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Wherefore is this?
 :
 :ANTONY
 :To let a fellow that will take rewards
 :And say "God quit you!" be familiar with
 :My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
S:
 :And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
 :
S:Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
 :
 :The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
 :
 :And to proclaim it civilly were like

 :A haltered neck which does the hangman thank
S:For being yare about him.

 :
 :If that thy father live, let him repent
 :
S:Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry

 :
 :Thou hast been whipped for following him.
 :
 :Henceforth
 :The white hand of a lady fever thee;
 :Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar.
 :Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou say
 :He makes me angry with him; for he seems
 :Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
S:
 :Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,
 :
 :And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't,
 :
 :When my good stars that were my former guides
 :
S:Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
 :
 :Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
 :
 :My speech and what is done, tell him he has
 :
 :Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
 :He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
 :As he shall like to quit me. Urge it thou.
S:Hence with thy stripes, begone!	[Thidias exits.]

 :
 :And poison it in the source, and the first stone
 :Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
 :Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,
S:Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
 :
 :Together with my brave Egyptians all,
 :
 :By the discandying of this pelleted storm
 :
 :Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
 :Have buried them for prey!
 :
S:ANTONY  I am satisfied.
 :
 :Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
 :
 :I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
 :

 :lady?
 :
 :If from the field I shall return once more
 :To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
 :I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
 :There's hope in 't yet.
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  That's my brave lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
S:I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed,
 :
 :And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
 :
 :Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
 :
 :Of me for jests. But now I'll set my teeth
 :And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
 :Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
 :All my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more.
S:Let's mock the midnight bell.
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  It is my birthday.
 :
 :I had thought t' have held it poor. But since my lord
 :
 :Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
 :
 :

 :
S:

 :
 :Do so; we'll speak to them, and tonight I'll force
 :
 :The wine peep through their scars.--Come on, my
 :
 :queen,
 :There's sap in 't yet. The next time I do fight
 :I'll make Death love me, for I will contend
 :Even with his pestilent scythe.
 :[All but Enobarbus exit.]
S:
 :
 :
S:ENOBARBUS
 :
 :Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
 :
 :Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
 :
 :The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still

 :Scene 14
 :========
 :[Enter Antony and Eros.]
 :
 :
S:
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
 :
 :
 :
 :EROS  Ay, noble lord.
S:
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish,
 :
 :A vapor sometime like a bear or lion,
 :A towered citadel, a pendent rock,
 :A forked mountain, or blue promontory
 :With trees upon 't that nod unto the world
 :And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these
 :signs.
S:
 :They are black vesper's pageants.
 :
S:
 :
 :EROS  Ay, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :That which is now a horse, even with a thought
 :The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
 :As water is in water.
 :
 :EROS  It does, my lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
 :
S:Even such a body. Here I am Antony,
 :
 :Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
 :
 :I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,
 :
 :Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine--
 :Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto 't
 :A million more, now lost--she, Eros, has
 :Packed cards with Caesar and false-played my glory
 :Unto an enemy's triumph.
S:Nay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left us
 :
 :Ourselves to end ourselves.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Mardian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :O, thy vile lady!
 :
 :She has robbed me of my sword.
 :
 :MARDIAN  No, Antony,
 :My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled
 :With thine entirely.
 :
S:
 :ANTONY  Hence, saucy eunuch! Peace!
 :
 :She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.
 :
S:
 :
 :MARDIAN
 :
 :Death of one person can be paid but once,
 :
 :And that she has discharged. What thou wouldst do
S:Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
 :
S:Was "Antony, most noble Antony."
 :
 :Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
 :
 :The name of Antony; it was divided
 :
 :Between her heart and lips. She rendered life
 :Thy name so buried in her.
 :
 :ANTONY  Dead, then?
 :
 :MARDIAN  Dead.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
S:Unarm, Eros. The long day's task is done,
 :
 :And we must sleep.--That thou depart'st hence safe
 :
 :Does pay thy labor richly. Go.	[Mardian exits.]
 :
 :Off, pluck off!
 :[Eros begins to remove Antony's armor.]
 :The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
S:The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
 :
 :Heart, once be stronger than thy continent;
 :
 :Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace!
 :
 :No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go.
 :You have been nobly borne.--From me awhile.
 :[Eros exits.]
 :I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
 :Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
 :All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
S:
 :Lie down and stray no farther. Now all labor
 :
S:Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
 :
 :Itself with strength. Seal, then, and all is done.--
 :
 :Eros!--I come, my queen.--Eros!--Stay for me.
 :
 :Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
S:And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
 :
 :Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
 :
 :And all the haunt be ours.--Come, Eros, Eros!
 :
 :
 :[Enter Eros.]
 :
 :
 :EROS
 :What would my lord?
S:
 :
 :
S:ANTONY  Since Cleopatra died
 :
 :I have lived in such dishonor that the gods
 :
 :Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
 :
 :Quartered the world and o'er green Neptune's back
 :With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
S:The courage of a woman--less noble mind
 :
 :Than she which, by her death, our Caesar tells
 :
 :"I am conqueror of myself." Thou art sworn, Eros,
 :
S:That when the exigent should come, which now
 :
 :Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
 :
S:Th' inevitable prosecution of
 :
 :Disgrace and horror, that on my command
 :
 :Thou then wouldst kill me. Do 't. The time is come.
 :
 :Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
 :Put color in thy cheek.
S:
 :
 :EROS  The gods withhold me!
 :
 :Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
 :
S:Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Eros,
 :
 :Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see
S:Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down
 :
 :His corrigible neck, his face subdued
 :
 :To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat
 :
S:Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
 :
 :His baseness that ensued?
 :
 :
 :
 :EROS  I would not see 't.
 :
S:ANTONY
 :
 :Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured.
 :
 :Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
 :
 :Most useful for thy country.
 :
 :EROS  O, sir, pardon me!
 :
 :ANTONY
 :When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
S:
 :To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
 :
 :Or thy precedent services are all
 :
 :But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
 :
S:
 :
 :EROS
 :
 :Turn from me then that noble countenance
 :
 :Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
 :
 :ANTONY  Lo thee!	[He turns away.]
 :
 :EROS
 :My sword is drawn.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Then let it do at once
 :
S:The thing why thou hast drawn it.
 :
 :
 :
 :EROS  My dear master,
 :
 :My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
 :Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
 :
 :ANTONY  'Tis said, man, and farewell.
S:
 :
 :EROS
 :
 :Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Now, Eros.
 :
 :EROS
 :Why, there, then.	[Stabs himself.]
 :Thus I do escape the sorrow
S:
 :Of Antony's death.	[Dies.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Thrice nobler than myself,
 :
 :Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
 :I should and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
S:Have by their brave instruction got upon me
 :
 :A nobleness in record. But I will be
 :
 :A bridegroom in my death and run into 't
 :
 :As to a lover's bed. Come then, and, Eros,
S:Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
 :
 :I learned of thee. [He stabs himself.] How, not dead?
 :
 :Not dead?
 :
 :The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
 :
 :[Enter a company of the Guard, one of them named
 :Dercetus.]
 :
 :
S:

S:Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
 :
 :Sufficing strokes for death.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Most absolute lord,
 :My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
 :
 :ANTONY
 :When did she send thee?
 :
S:
 :DIOMEDES  Now, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONY  Where is she?
 :
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
S:Locked in her monument. She had a prophesying
 :
S:fear
 :
 :Of what hath come to pass. For when she saw--
 :
 :Which never shall be found--you did suspect
 :
 :She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
 :Would not be purged, she sent you word she was
S:dead;
 :
 :But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
 :
 :Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come,
 :
 :I dread, too late.
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
 :
S:DIOMEDES
 :
 :What ho! The Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
 :
 :Come, your lord calls.
 :
 :
 :[Enter four or five of the Guard of Antony.]
 :
 :
 :ANTONY
 :Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.
S:
 :'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :
 :Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
 :All your true followers out.
S:
 :
 :ALL  Most heavy day!
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONY
 :
 :Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
 :
 :To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
 :Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
 :Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
 :I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,
 :And have my thanks for all.

S:Our strength is all gone into heaviness;

 :DERCETUS  I am called Dercetus.

S:

 :A greater crack. The round world
 :Should have shook lions into civil streets
 :And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
 :Is not a single doom; in the name lay
 :A moiety of the world.
 :
S:
 :DERCETUS  He is dead, Caesar,
 :
 :Not by a public minister of justice,
 :
 :Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand
 :
 :Which writ his honor in the acts it did
 :Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
 :Splitted the heart. This is his sword.
S:I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained
 :
 :With his most noble blood.

S:Our most persisted deeds.

S:AGRIPPA  A rarer spirit never

 :When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
 :He needs must see himself.
S:
 :
 :CAESAR  O Antony,
 :
 :I have followed thee to this, but we do lance
 :
 :Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
S:Have shown to thee such a declining day
 :
 :Or look on thine. We could not stall together
 :
S:In the whole world. But yet let me lament
 :
 :With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
 :
 :That thou my brother, my competitor
 :
 :In top of all design, my mate in empire,
 :Friend and companion in the front of war,
 :The arm of mine own body, and the heart
 :Where mine his thoughts did kindle--that our stars
 :Unreconciliable should divide
 :Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--

S:

 :
 :Confined in all she has, her monument,

 :The quality of her passion shall require,
 :Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
 :She do defeat us, for her life in Rome
 :Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
S:And with your speediest bring us what she says

 :Scene 2
 :
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, and Iras.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :My desolation does begin to make
 :
 :A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
 :
 :Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
S:A minister of her will. And it is great
 :
 :To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
 :
 :Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
 :
 :Which sleeps and never palates more the dung,
 :The beggar's nurse, and Caesar's.
 :
 :[Enter Proculeius.]
 :
S:
 :
 :PROCULEIUS
 :
S:Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,
 :
 :And bids thee study on what fair demands
 :
 :Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  What's thy name?
 :
 :PROCULEIUS
 :My name is Proculeius.
 :
S:
 :CLEOPATRA  Antony
 :
S:Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but
 :
 :I do not greatly care to be deceived
 :
 :That have no use for trusting. If your master
 :
 :Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
 :That majesty, to keep decorum, must
 :No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
 :To give me conquered Egypt for my son,
 :He gives me so much of mine own as I
S:Will kneel to him with thanks.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  Be of good cheer.
 :
 :You're fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
S:Make your full reference freely to my lord,
 :
 :Who is so full of grace that it flows over
 :
 :On all that need. Let me report to him
 :
S:Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
 :
 :A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
 :
 :Where he for grace is kneeled to.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Pray you tell him
 :I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
 :The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
 :A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
S:Look him i' th' face.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  This I'll report, dear lady.
 :
 :Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
 :Of him that caused it.
 :
 :[Gallus and Soldiers enter and seize Cleopatra.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :GALLUS
 :
 :You see how easily she may be surprised.
 :Guard her till Caesar come.
 :
 :IRAS  Royal queen!
 :
 :CHARMIAN
S:
 :O, Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen!
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA, [drawing a dagger]
 :
 :Quick, quick, good hands!
 :
 :PROCULEIUS, [seizing the dagger]  Hold, worthy lady, hold!
 :Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
 :Relieved, but not betrayed.
S:
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  What, of death, too,
 :
 :That rids our dogs of languish?
 :
S:
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  Cleopatra,
 :
S:Do not abuse my master's bounty by
 :
 :Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
 :
 :His nobleness well acted, which your death
 :
 :Will never let come forth.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Where art thou, Death?
 :Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
 :Worth many babes and beggars.
S:
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  O, temperance, lady!
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
S:Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir.
 :
 :If idle talk will once be necessary--
 :
 :I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
 :
 :Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
 :Will not wait pinioned at your master's court,
 :Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
 :Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
 :And show me to the shouting varletry
S:Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
 :
 :Be gentle grave unto me; rather on Nilus' mud
 :
 :Lay me stark naked, and let the waterflies
 :
 :Blow me into abhorring; rather make
 :My country's high pyramides my gibbet
 :And hang me up in chains!
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  You do extend
 :These thoughts of horror further than you shall
S:
 :Find cause in Caesar.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Dolabella.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Proculeius,
 :
 :What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
 :And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
 :I'll take her to my guard.
S:
 :
 :PROCULEIUS  So, Dolabella,
 :
 :It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
 :
S:[To Cleopatra.] To Caesar I will speak what you
 :
 :shall please,
 :
 :If you'll employ me to him.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Say I would die.
 :[Proculeius, Gallus, and Soldiers exit.]
 :
S:DOLABELLA
 :
 :Most noble empress, you have heard of me.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :I cannot tell.
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Assuredly you know me.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
S:
 :No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
 :
 :You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
 :
 :Is 't not your trick?
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  I understand not, madam.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.
S:
 :O, such another sleep, that I might see
 :
 :But such another man.
 :
 :
 :
S:DOLABELLA  If it might please you--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck
 :A sun and moon, which kept their course and
 :lighted
 :The little O, the Earth.
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Most sovereign creature--
S:
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :His legs bestrid the ocean, his reared arm
 :
 :Crested the world. His voice was propertied
 :
 :As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
 :But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
 :He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
 :There was no winter in 't; an autumn 'twas
 :That grew the more by reaping. His delights
 :Were dolphin-like; they showed his back above
S:
 :The element they lived in. In his livery
 :
 :Walked crowns and crownets; realms and islands
 :
 :were
 :
 :As plates dropped from his pocket.
 :
S:DOLABELLA  Cleopatra--
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Think you there was, or might be, such a man
 :
S:As this I dreamt of?
 :
 :
 :
S:DOLABELLA  Gentle madam, no.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :You lie up to the hearing of the gods!
 :But if there be nor ever were one such,
 :It's past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff
S:To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t' imagine
 :
 :An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
 :
 :Condemning shadows quite.
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Hear me, good madam.
 :Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
 :As answering to the weight. Would I might never
 :O'ertake pursued success but I do feel,
 :By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
S:
 :My very heart at root.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  I thank you, sir.
 :
 :Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
 :
S:DOLABELLA
 :
 :I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Nay, pray you, sir.
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Though he be honorable--
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  He'll lead me, then, in triumph.
S:
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Madam, he will. I know 't.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Flourish. Enter Caesar, Proculeius, Gallus, Maecenas,
 :and others of his train.]
 :
 :
 :ALL  Make way there! Caesar!
S:
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Which is the Queen of Egypt?
 :
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  It is the Emperor, madam.
S:[Cleopatra kneels.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Arise. You shall not kneel.
 :
 :I pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt.
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  Sir, the gods
 :
 :Will have it thus. My master and my lord
 :
S:I must obey.	[She stands.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Take to you no hard thoughts.
 :
 :The record of what injuries you did us,
 :Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
 :As things but done by chance.
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Sole sir o' th' world,
 :I cannot project mine own cause so well
S:
 :To make it clear, but do confess I have
 :
 :Been laden with like frailties which before
 :
 :Have often shamed our sex.
 :
S:
 :
 :CAESAR  Cleopatra, know
 :
 :We will extenuate rather than enforce.
 :
 :If you apply yourself to our intents,
 :Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
 :A benefit in this change; but if you seek
S:To lay on me a cruelty by taking
 :
 :Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
 :
 :Of my good purposes, and put your children
 :
 :To that destruction which I'll guard them from
S:If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :And may through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
 :Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
 :Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
 :[She holds out a paper.]
 :
S:CAESAR
 :
 :You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels
 :I am possessed of. 'Tis exactly valued,
 :Not petty things admitted.--Where's Seleucus?
 :
 :[Enter Seleucus.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SELEUCUS  Here, madam.
 :
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,
 :
 :Upon his peril, that I have reserved
 :To myself nothing.--Speak the truth, Seleucus.
 :
 :SELEUCUS
 :Madam, I had rather seel my lips
S:Than to my peril speak that which is not.
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  What have I kept back?
 :
 :
 :
S:SELEUCUS
 :
 :Enough to purchase what you have made known.
 :
 :
 :
 :CAESAR
 :Nay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve
 :Your wisdom in the deed.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  See, Caesar, O, behold
 :
 :How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours,
 :
S:And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
 :
 :The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
 :
 :Even make me wild.--O slave, of no more trust
 :
S:Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? Thou
 :
 :shalt
 :
 :Go back, I warrant thee! But I'll catch thine eyes
 :
 :Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
S:O rarely base!
 :
 :
 :
S:CAESAR  Good queen, let us entreat you--
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
 :That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
 :Doing the honor of thy lordliness
 :To one so meek, that mine own servant should
 :Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
 :Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
S:
 :That I some lady trifles have reserved,
 :
 :Immoment toys, things of such dignity
 :
 :As we greet modern friends withal, and say
 :
S:Some nobler token I have kept apart
 :
 :For Livia and Octavia, to induce
 :
S:Their mediation, must I be unfolded
 :
S:With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
 :
 :Beneath the fall I have. [To Seleucus.] Prithee, go
 :
 :hence,
 :
 :Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
 :Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
 :Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
 :
 :CAESAR  Forbear, Seleucus.
 :[Seleucus exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
S:Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
 :
S:For things that others do; and when we fall,
 :
 :We answer others' merits in our name--
 :
 :Are therefore to be pitied.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Cleopatra,
 :Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
 :Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be 't yours!
 :Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe
 :Caesar's no merchant to make prize with you
S:
 :Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be
 :
 :cheered.
 :
 :Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear
 :
 :queen,
 :For we intend so to dispose you as
 :Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
 :Our care and pity is so much upon you
 :That we remain your friend. And so adieu.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :My master and my lord!
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Not so. Adieu.
 :[Flourish. Caesar and his train exit.]
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
 :
 :Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian.
S:[She whispers to Charmian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :IRAS
 :
 :Finish, good lady. The bright day is done,
S:And we are for the dark.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA, [to Charmian]  Hie thee again.
 :
 :I have spoke already, and it is provided.
 :Go put it to the haste.
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Madam, I will.
 :
S:[Enter Dolabella.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA
S:Where's the Queen?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Behold, sir.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Dolabella.
 :
S:DOLABELLA
 :
 :Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
 :
 :Which my love makes religion to obey,
 :
 :I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
S:Intends his journey, and within three days
 :
 :You with your children will he send before.
 :
 :Make your best use of this. I have performed
 :
 :Your pleasure and my promise.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Dolabella,
 :
 :I shall remain your debtor.
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  I your servant.
 :Adieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Farewell, and thanks.	[He exits.]
 :
 :Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
S:Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
 :
 :In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves
 :
 :With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall
 :
 :Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,
S:Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded
 :
 :And forced to drink their vapor.
 :
 :
 :
 :IRAS  The gods forbid!
 :
S:CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
 :
S:Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
 :
 :Ballad us out o' tune. The quick comedians
 :
 :Extemporally will stage us and present
 :
 :Our Alexandrian revels. Antony
 :Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
 :Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
 :I' th' posture of a whore.
 :
 :IRAS  O the good gods!
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Nay, that's certain.
 :
 :
 :
S:IRAS
 :
 :I'll never see 't! For I am sure mine nails
 :
 :Are stronger than mine eyes.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Why, that's the way
 :To fool their preparation and to conquer
 :Their most absurd intents.
 :
S:[Enter Charmian.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Now, Charmian!
 :
 :Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch
 :My best attires. I am again for Cydnus
 :To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.--
 :Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed,
 :And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee
 :leave
S:
S:To play till Doomsday.--Bring our crown and all.
 :
 :[Iras exits. A noise within.]
 :
 :Wherefore's this noise?
 :
 :
 :[Enter a Guardsman.]
 :
 :
 :GUARDSMAN  Here is a rural fellow
S:That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
 :
 :He brings you figs.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :Let him come in.	[Guardsman exits.]
 :What poor an instrument
 :May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
 :My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
S:Of woman in me. Now from head to foot
 :
 :I am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon
 :
 :No planet is of mine.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Guardsman and Countryman, with a basket.]
 :
 :
 :GUARDSMAN  This is the man.
 :
S:
 :CLEOPATRA  Avoid, and leave him.	[Guardsman exits.]
 :
 :Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
 :
 :That kills and pains not?
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  Truly I have him, but I would not be
 :the party that should desire you to touch him, for
 :his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do
 :seldom or never recover.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Remember'st thou any that have died on 't?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  Very many, men and women too. I
 :heard of one of them no longer than yesterday--a
 :very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a
 :woman should not do but in the way of honesty--
 :how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt.
S:
 :Truly, she makes a very good report o' th' worm.
 :
 :But he that will believe all that they say shall never
 :
 :be saved by half that they do. But this is most
 :
 :falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  Get thee hence. Farewell.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  I wish you all joy of the worm.
 :
 :[He sets down the basket.]
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Farewell.
S:
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  You must think this, look you, that the
 :
 :worm will do his kind.
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Ay, ay, farewell.
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  Look you, the worm is not to be trusted
 :but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there
S:is no goodness in the worm.
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you,
 :for it is not worth the feeding.
S:
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Will it eat me?
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  You must not think I am so simple but
 :I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I
 :know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil
 :dress her not. But truly these same whoreson devils
 :do the gods great harm in their women, for in every
 :ten that they make, the devils mar five.
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  Well, get thee gone. Farewell.
 :
 :
 :
 :COUNTRYMAN  Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th'
 :worm.	[He exits.]
 :
 :[Enter Iras bearing Cleopatra's royal regalia.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I have
 :
 :Immortal longings in me. Now no more
 :The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
S:[Charmian and Iras begin to dress her.]
 :
 :Yare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear
 :
 :Antony call. I see him rouse himself
 :
 :To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
 :The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
 :To excuse their after wrath.--Husband, I come!
 :Now to that name my courage prove my title.
 :I am fire and air; my other elements
S:I give to baser life.--So, have you done?
 :
 :Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
 :
 :Farewell, kind Charmian.--Iras, long farewell.
 :
 :[She kisses them. Iras falls and dies.]
 :Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
 :If thou and nature can so gently part,
 :The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
 :Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
 :If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
S:
 :It is not worth leave-taking.
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN
 :
 :Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
 :The gods themselves do weep!
 :
 :CLEOPATRA  This proves me base.
 :If she first meet the curled Antony,
S:
 :He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
 :
 :Which is my heaven to have.--Come, thou mortal
 :
 :wretch,	[She places an asp on her breast.]
 :
S:With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
 :
 :Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
 :
S:Be angry and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
 :
 :That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
 :
 :Unpolicied!
 :
S:
 :
 :CHARMIAN  O eastern star!
 :
 :
 :
S:CLEOPATRA  Peace, peace!
 :
 :Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
 :
 :That sucks the nurse asleep?
 :
 :
S:CHARMIAN  O, break! O, break!
 :
 :
 :
 :CLEOPATRA
 :
 :As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle--
 :O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
 :[She places an asp on her arm.]
 :What should I stay--	[Dies.]
 :
S:CHARMIAN  In this wild world? So, fare thee well.
 :
 :Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies
 :
 :A lass unparalleled. Downy windows, close,
 :
 :[She closes Cleopatra's eyes.]
 :And golden Phoebus, never be beheld
 :Of eyes again so royal. Your crown's awry.
 :I'll mend it, and then play--
 :
 :[Enter the Guard rustling in.]
S:
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :
 :Where's the Queen?
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Speak softly. Wake her not.
S:
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :
 :Caesar hath sent--
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN  Too slow a messenger.
S:[She takes out an asp.]
 :
 :O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :Approach, ho! All's not well. Caesar's beguiled.
 :
 :SECOND GUARD
 :There's Dolabella sent from Caesar. Call him.
 :[A Guardsman exits.]
S:
 :
 :
S:FIRST GUARD
 :
 :What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?
 :
 :
 :
 :CHARMIAN
 :It is well done, and fitting for a princess
 :Descended of so many royal kings.
 :Ah, soldier!	[Charmian dies.]
 :
 :[Enter Dolabella.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA
 :
 :How goes it here?
 :
 :SECOND GUARD  All dead.
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Caesar, thy thoughts
S:
 :Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
 :
S:To see performed the dreaded act which thou
 :
 :So sought'st to hinder.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Caesar and all his train, marching.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ALL  A way there, a way for Caesar!
 :
 :
S:DOLABELLA
 :
 :O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
 :
 :That you did fear is done.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Bravest at the last,
 :She leveled at our purposes and, being royal,
 :Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
 :I do not see them bleed.
 :
S:
 :DOLABELLA  Who was last with them?
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :
 :A simple countryman that brought her figs.
 :This was his basket.
 :
 :CAESAR  Poisoned, then.
 :
S:
 :FIRST GUARD  O Caesar,
 :
 :This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.
 :
 :I found her trimming up the diadem
 :
 :On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
 :And on the sudden dropped.
 :
 :CAESAR  O, noble weakness!
 :If they had swallowed poison, 'twould appear
S:
 :By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
 :
 :As she would catch another Antony
 :
 :In her strong toil of grace.
 :
 :
 :DOLABELLA  Here on her breast
 :There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
 :The like is on her arm.
S:
 :
 :FIRST GUARD
 :
S:This is an aspic's trail, and these fig leaves
 :
 :Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
 :
 :Upon the caves of Nile.
 :
 :
 :CAESAR  Most probable
 :That so she died, for her physician tells me
 :She hath pursued conclusions infinite
 :Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
 :And bear her women from the monument.
S:
 :She shall be buried by her Antony.
 :
 :No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
 :
 :A pair so famous. High events as these
 :
 :Strike those that make them; and their story is
 :No less in pity than his glory which
 :Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
 :In solemn show attend this funeral,
 :And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
S:
 :High order in this great solemnity.
 :
S:[They all exit, the Guards
 :
 :bearing the dead bodies.]
 :
