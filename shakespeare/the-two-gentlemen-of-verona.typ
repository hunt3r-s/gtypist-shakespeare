S:Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Valentine and Proteus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.
 :Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
 :Were 't not affection chains thy tender days
S:
 :To the sweet glances of thy honored love,
 :
 :I rather would entreat thy company
 :
 :To see the wonders of the world abroad
 :
 :Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
 :Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
 :But since thou lov'st, love still and thrive therein,
 :Even as I would when I to love begin.
 :
S:
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.
 :
S:Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
 :
 :Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.
 :
 :Wish me partaker in thy happiness
 :
 :When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
 :If ever danger do environ thee,
 :Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
S:For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :And on a love-book pray for my success?
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:That's on some shallow story of deep love,
 :
 :How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :That's a deep story of a deeper love,
 :For he was more than over shoes in love.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,
S:
 :And yet you never swam the Hellespont.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
 :
S:
 :
S:PROTEUS  What?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,
 :Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading
 :moment's mirth
 :With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;
S:If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
 :
 :If lost, why then a grievous labor won;
 :
 :How ever, but a folly bought with wit,
 :
 :Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
 :
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
S:'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :Love is your master, for he masters you;
 :And he that is so yoked by a fool
S:Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud
 :The eating canker dwells, so eating love
 :Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :And writers say: as the most forward bud
S:
 :Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
 :
 :Even so by love the young and tender wit
 :
 :Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud,
 :
 :Losing his verdure, even in the prime,
 :And all the fair effects of future hopes.
 :But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
S:That art a votary to fond desire?
 :
 :Once more adieu. My father at the road
 :
 :Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.
S:
 :To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
 :
 :Of thy success in love, and what news else
 :
 :Betideth here in absence of thy friend.
 :
 :And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :As much to you at home. And so farewell.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :He after honor hunts, I after love.
 :
 :He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;
 :
 :I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.
 :Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
 :Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
 :War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
S:Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Speed.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED
 :Sir Proteus, 'save you. Saw you my master?
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED
 :
 :Twenty to one, then, he is shipped already,
 :
 :And I have played the sheep in losing him.
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
 :
S:An if the shepherd be awhile away.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  You conclude that my master is a shepherd,
 :
 :then, and I a sheep?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  I do.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Why, then my horns are his horns, whether I
 :
 :wake or sleep.
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS  A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  This proves me still a sheep.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  True, and thy master a shepherd.
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
 :
 :PROTEUS  It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
 :
 :SPEED  The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the
S:
 :sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my
 :
 :master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.
 :
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
 :
 :shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for
 :
 :wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
 :follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.
 :
 :SPEED  Such another proof will make me cry "baa."
 :
 :PROTEUS  But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to
S:
 :Julia?
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  Ay, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a
 :
 :
 :laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
 :
S:lost mutton, nothing for my labor.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Here's too small a pasture for such store of
 :
S:muttons.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  If the ground be overcharged, you were best
 :
 :stick her.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Nay, in that you are astray; 'twere best pound
 :you.
 :
 :SPEED  Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
 :carrying your letter.
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED
 :From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
 :'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your
 :lover.
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  But what said she?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED, [nodding]  Ay.
 :
S:PROTEUS  Nod--"Ay." Why, that's "noddy."
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  You mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask
 :
 :me if she did nod, and I say "ay."
 :
 :PROTEUS  And that set together is "noddy."
 :
 :SPEED  Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
 :take it for your pains.
S:
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing
 :
 :but the word "noddy" for my pains.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
 :
 :SPEED  And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
 :
 :PROTEUS  Come, come, open the matter in brief. What
S:
 :said she?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Open your purse, that the money and the matter
 :
S:may be both at once delivered.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS, [giving money]  Well, sir, here is for your
 :
 :pains. What said she?
 :
 :SPEED, [looking at the money]  Truly, sir, I think you'll
 :hardly win her.
 :
S:PROTEUS  Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from
 :
 :her?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,
S:not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter.
 :
S:And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
 :
 :fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind.
 :
 :Give her no token but stones, for she's as hard as
 :
 :steel.
 :
S:PROTEUS  What said she? Nothing?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  No, not so much as "Take this for thy pains."
 :
 :To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have
 :testerned me. In requital whereof, henceforth
 :carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I'll commend
 :you to my master.
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:
 :Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,
 :
 :Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
 :
 :Being destined to a drier death on shore.
 :
 :[Speed exits.]
 :I must go send some better messenger.
 :I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
 :Receiving them from such a worthless post.
S:[He exits.]

 :
 :=======
 :[Enter Julia and Lucetta.]
 :
 :
 :JULIA
S:But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
 :
 :Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
 :
 :
S:JULIA
 :
S:Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
 :
 :That every day with parle encounter me,
 :
 :In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
 :According to my shallow simple skill.
 :
 :JULIA
S:
 :What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
 :But, were I you, he never should be mine.
 :
 :JULIA
 :What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Well of his wealth, but of himself so-so.
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Lord, Lord, to see what folly reigns in us!
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :How now? What means this passion at his name?
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Pardon, dear madam, 'tis a passing shame
S:
 :That I, unworthy body as I am,
 :
 :Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :
S:JULIA
 :
 :Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Then thus: of many good, I think him best.
 :
 :JULIA  Your reason?
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:
 :I have no other but a woman's reason:
 :
 :I think him so because I think him so.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
S:
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Why, he of all the rest hath never moved me.
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Yet he of all the rest I think best loves you.
 :
S:JULIA
 :
 :His little speaking shows his love but small.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :They do not love that do not show their love.
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :O, they love least that let men know their love.
 :
 :
S:JULIA  I would I knew his mind.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA, [handing her a paper]  Peruse this paper,
 :
 :madam.
 :
 :JULIA [reads]  "To Julia."--Say from whom.
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA  That the contents will show.
 :
S:
 :
 :JULIA  Say, say who gave it thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from
 :
S:Proteus.
 :
 :He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
 :
S:Did in your name receive it. Pardon the fault, I pray.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
 :Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?
 :To whisper and conspire against my youth?
 :Now trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,
 :And you an officer fit for the place.
 :There, take the paper; see it be returned,
S:
 :Or else return no more into my sight.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA, [taking the paper]
 :
 :To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
 :
 :JULIA
 :Will you be gone?
 :
S:
 :LUCETTA  That you may ruminate.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter.
S:It were a shame to call her back again
 :
 :And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
 :
 :What fool is she that knows I am a maid
 :
 :And would not force the letter to my view,
S:Since maids in modesty say "no" to that
 :
 :Which they would have the profferer construe "ay"!
 :
S:Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
 :
 :That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
 :
 :And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
 :
 :How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
 :When willingly I would have had her here!
 :How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
S:When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
 :
 :My penance is to call Lucetta back
 :
 :And ask remission for my folly past.--
 :
 :What ho, Lucetta!
 :
 :[Enter Lucetta.]
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA  What would your Ladyship?
S:
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Is 't near dinner time?
 :
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA  I would it were,
 :
 :That you might kill your stomach on your meat
 :
 :And not upon your maid.
 :[She drops a paper and then retrieves it.]
 :
 :JULIA
 :What is 't that you took up so gingerly?
S:
 :
S:LUCETTA  Nothing.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA  Why didst thou stoop, then?
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :To take a paper up that I let fall.
 :
 :JULIA  And is that paper nothing?
 :
S:
S:LUCETTA  Nothing concerning me.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
 :
 :Unless it have a false interpreter.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :That I might sing it, madam, to a tune,
S:Give me a note. Your Ladyship can set--
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :As little by such toys as may be possible.
S:Best sing it to the tune of "Light o' Love."
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :It is too heavy for so light a tune.
 :
 :JULIA
 :Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
 :
 :
 :JULIA
S:And why not you?
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA  I cannot reach so high.
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [taking the paper]
 :Let's see your song. How now, minion!
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
S:
 :And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA  You do not?
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA  No, madam, 'tis too sharp.
 :
 :JULIA  You, minion, are too saucy.
 :
S:
 :LUCETTA  Nay, now you are too flat
 :
 :And mar the concord with too harsh a descant.
 :
 :There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.
 :
S:LUCETTA
 :
 :Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
 :Here is a coil with protestation.
 :[She rips up the paper. Lucetta begins
S:to pick up the pieces.]
 :
S:Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie.
 :
 :You would be fing'ring them to anger me.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased
 :
 :To be so angered with another letter.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
S:Nay, would I were so angered with the same!
 :
 :O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
 :
 :Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
 :
 :And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
 :I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
 :[She picks up some pieces.]
 :Look, here is writ "kind Julia." Unkind Julia,
 :As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
S:I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
 :
 :Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
 :
 :And here is writ "love-wounded Proteus."
 :
 :Poor wounded name, my bosom as a bed
S:Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed,
 :
 :And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
 :
 :But twice or thrice was "Proteus" written down.
 :
 :Be calm, good wind. Blow not a word away
 :Till I have found each letter in the letter
 :Except mine own name. That some whirlwind bear
 :Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock
S:And throw it thence into the raging sea.
 :
S:Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
 :
 :"Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
 :
 :To the sweet Julia." That I'll tear away--
 :
 :And yet I will not, sith so prettily
S:He couples it to his complaining names.
 :
 :Thus will I fold them one upon another.
 :
S:Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Lucetta.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:Madam, dinner is ready, and your father stays.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA  Well, let us go.
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :What, shall these papers lie like telltales here?
 :
 :JULIA
S:If you respect them, best to take them up.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Nay, I was taken up for laying them down.
 :Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
 :[She picks up the rest of the pieces.]
 :
 :JULIA
 :I see you have a month's mind to them.
S:
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
 :
 :I see things too, although you judge I wink.
 :
 :JULIA  Come, come, will 't please you go?

 :
 :[Enter Antonio and Pantino.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :Tell me, Pantino, what sad talk was that
S:Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
 :
S:
 :
 :PANTINO
 :
 :'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
 :
S:
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
S:Why, what of him?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANTINO  He wondered that your Lordship
 :
 :Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
 :While other men, of slender reputation,
 :Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
 :Some to the wars to try their fortune there,
 :Some to discover islands far away,
 :Some to the studious universities.
S:
 :For any or for all these exercises
 :
 :He said that Proteus your son was meet,
 :
 :And did request me to importune you
 :
 :To let him spend his time no more at home,
 :Which would be great impeachment to his age
 :In having known no travel in his youth.
 :
 :ANTONIO
S:
 :Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
 :
 :Whereon this month I have been hammering.
 :
 :I have considered well his loss of time
 :
 :And how he cannot be a perfect man,
 :Not being tried and tutored in the world.
 :Experience is by industry achieved
 :And perfected by the swift course of time.
 :Then tell me whither were I best to send him.
S:
 :
 :
S:PANTINO
 :
 :I think your Lordship is not ignorant
 :
 :How his companion, youthful Valentine,
 :
 :Attends the Emperor in his royal court.
 :
 :ANTONIO  I know it well.
 :
 :PANTINO
S:'Twere good, I think, your Lordship sent him thither.
 :
 :There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,
 :
 :Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
 :
 :And be in eye of every exercise
 :Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
 :
S:ANTONIO
 :
 :I like thy counsel. Well hast thou advised,
 :
 :And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
 :
 :The execution of it shall make known.
 :Even with the speediest expedition
 :I will dispatch him to the Emperor's court.
 :
 :PANTINO
 :Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
S:
 :With other gentlemen of good esteem,
 :
 :Are journeying to salute the Emperor
 :
 :And to commend their service to his will.
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
S:Good company. With them shall Proteus go.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Proteus reading.]
 :
 :
 :And in good time! Now will we break with him.
 :
S:PROTEUS, [to himself]
 :
 :Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!
 :
 :Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
 :
 :Here is her oath for love, her honor's pawn.
 :O, that our fathers would applaud our loves
 :To seal our happiness with their consents.
S:O heavenly Julia!
 :
 :
 :
S:ANTONIO
 :
 :How now? What letter are you reading there?
 :
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :May 't please your Lordship, 'tis a word or two
 :
 :Of commendations sent from Valentine,
 :Delivered by a friend that came from him.
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :Lend me the letter. Let me see what news.
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
 :
 :How happily he lives, how well beloved
 :And daily graced by the Emperor,
 :Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :And how stand you affected to his wish?
S:
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
S:As one relying on your Lordship's will,
 :
 :And not depending on his friendly wish.
 :
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :My will is something sorted with his wish.
 :Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed,
 :For what I will, I will, and there an end.
 :I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
 :With Valentinus in the Emperor's court.
S:
 :What maintenance he from his friends receives,
 :
 :Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
 :
 :Tomorrow be in readiness to go.
 :
 :Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :My lord, I cannot be so soon provided.
 :Please you deliberate a day or two.
S:
 :
 :
 :ANTONIO
 :
 :Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
 :
 :No more of stay. Tomorrow thou must go.--
 :Come on, Pantino; you shall be employed
 :To hasten on his expedition.
 :[Antonio and Pantino exit.]
 :
S:
 :PROTEUS
 :
S:Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning
 :
 :And drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned.
 :
 :I feared to show my father Julia's letter
 :
 :Lest he should take exceptions to my love,
 :And with the vantage of mine own excuse
 :Hath he excepted most against my love.
 :O, how this spring of love resembleth
S:The uncertain glory of an April day,
 :
 :Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
 :
 :And by and by a cloud takes all away.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pantino.]
 :
 :
 :PANTINO
S:Sir Proteus, your father calls for you.
 :
 :He is in haste. Therefore, I pray you, go.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto.
 :
 :[Aside.] And yet a thousand times it answers "no."

S:Scene 1
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Valentine and Speed, carrying a glove.]
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED
 :Sir, your glove.
 :
 :VALENTINE  Not mine. My gloves are on.
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED
 :
 :Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Ha? Let me see. Ay, give it me, it's mine.
 :Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
 :Ah, Sylvia, Sylvia!
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED, [calling]  Madam Sylvia! Madam Sylvia!
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  How now, sirrah?
 :
 :SPEED  She is not within hearing, sir.
 :
S:VALENTINE  Why, sir, who bade you call her?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Your Worship, sir, or else I mistook.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Well, you'll still be too forward.
 :
S:SPEED  And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam
 :
 :Sylvia?
 :
 :SPEED  She that your Worship loves?
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  Why, how know you that I am in love?
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
 :
 :learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms like
 :
 :a malcontent; to relish a love song like a robin
 :redbreast; to walk alone like one that had the
 :pestilence; to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his
S:ABC; to weep like a young wench that had buried
 :
 :her grandam; to fast like one that takes diet; to
 :
 :watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling
 :
 :like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when
 :you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked,
 :to walk like one of the lions. When you fasted, it was
 :presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it
S:was for want of money. And now you are metamorphosed
 :
 :with a mistress, that when I look on you, I
 :
 :can hardly think you my master.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Are all these things perceived in me?
 :
 :SPEED  They are all perceived without you.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  Without me? They cannot.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Without you? Nay, that's certain, for without
 :
 :you were so simple, none else would. But you are so
 :
 :without these follies, that these follies are within
 :you and shine through you like the water in an
 :urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
 :physician to comment on your malady.
 :
 :VALENTINE  But tell me, dost thou know my Lady
S:
 :Sylvia?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE  Hast thou observed that? Even she I mean.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Why, sir, I know her not.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Dost thou know her by my gazing on her
 :and yet know'st her not?
 :
 :SPEED  Is she not hard-favored, sir?
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE  Not so fair, boy, as well-favored.
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  Sir, I know that well enough.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  What dost thou know?
 :
 :
 :SPEED  That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favored.
 :
 :VALENTINE  I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her
 :favor infinite.
 :
S:
 :SPEED  That's because the one is painted, and the other
 :
S:out of all count.
 :
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE  How painted? And how out of count?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no
 :
 :man counts of her beauty.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  How esteem'st thou me? I account of her
 :
S:beauty.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  You never saw her since she was deformed.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  How long hath she been deformed?
 :
S:SPEED  Ever since you loved her.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  I have loved her ever since I saw her, and
 :
 :still I see her beautiful.
 :
 :SPEED  If you love her, you cannot see her.
 :
 :VALENTINE  Why?
 :
S:
 :SPEED  Because love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes,
 :
 :or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
 :
 :have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
 :
 :ungartered!
 :
 :VALENTINE  What should I see then?
 :
S:SPEED  Your own present folly and her passing deformity;
 :
 :for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
 :
 :hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on
 :
 :your hose.
S:
 :
S:VALENTINE  Belike, boy, then you are in love, for last
 :
 :morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  True, sir, I was in love with my bed. I thank you,
 :
 :you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
 :
 :bolder to chide you for yours.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
 :
 :SPEED  I would you were set, so your affection would
 :cease.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE  Last night she enjoined me to write some
 :
 :lines to one she loves.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  And have you?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  I have.
 :
S:SPEED  Are they not lamely writ?
 :
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE  No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
 :
 :Peace, here she comes.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Sylvia.]
 :
 :
S:SPEED, [aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
 :
 :Now will he interpret to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Madam and mistress, a thousand
 :good-morrows.
 :
S:SPEED, [aside]  O, give ye good ev'n! Here's a million of
 :
 :manners.
 :
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA  Sir Valentine, and servant, to you two
 :thousand.
 :
S:SPEED, [aside]  He should give her interest, and she
 :
 :gives it him.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :As you enjoined me, I have writ your letter
 :Unto the secret, nameless friend of yours,
 :Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
 :But for my duty to your Ladyship.
 :[He gives her a paper.]
S:
 :
 :
S:SYLVIA
 :
 :I thank you, gentle servant, 'tis very clerkly done.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,
 :For, being ignorant to whom it goes,
 :I writ at random, very doubtfully.
 :
 :SYLVIA
S:
 :Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :No, madam. So it stead you, I will write,
 :
 :Please you command, a thousand times as much,
 :And yet--
 :
 :SYLVIA
S:A pretty period. Well, I guess the sequel;
 :
 :And yet I will not name it And yet I care not.
 :
 :And yet take this again.	[She holds out the paper.]
 :
 :And yet I thank you,
 :Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
 :
 :SPEED, [aside]
 :And yet you will; and yet another "yet."
 :
S:
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :What means your Ladyship? Do you not like it?
 :
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :Yes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,
 :But, since unwillingly, take them again.
S:Nay, take them.	[She again offers him the paper.]
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Madam, they are for you.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :Ay, ay. You writ them, sir, at my request,
 :But I will none of them. They are for you.
 :I would have had them writ more movingly.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE, [taking the paper]
 :
 :Please you, I'll write your Ladyship another.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
 :And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
 :
 :VALENTINE  If it please me, madam? What then?
S:
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :
 :Why, if it please you, take it for your labor.
 :
 :And so good-morrow, servant.	[Sylvia exits.]
 :
 :SPEED, [aside]
 :O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible
 :As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a
S:
 :steeple!
 :
 :My master sues to her, and she hath taught her
 :
 :suitor,
 :
 :He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
 :O excellent device! Was there ever heard a better?
S:That my master, being scribe, to himself should
 :
 :write the letter?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  How now, sir? What, are you reasoning
 :with yourself?
 :
 :SPEED  Nay, I was rhyming. 'Tis you that have the
 :reason.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE  To do what?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  To be a spokesman from Madam Sylvia.
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  To whom?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  To yourself. Why, she woos you by a figure.
 :
 :VALENTINE  What figure?
 :
 :SPEED  By a letter, I should say.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  Why, she hath not writ to me!
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  What need she when she hath made you write
 :to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
 :
 :VALENTINE  No, believe me.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive
 :
 :her earnest?
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  She gave me none, except an angry word.
 :
 :SPEED  Why, she hath given you a letter.
 :
 :VALENTINE  That's the letter I writ to her friend.
S:
S:
 :
 :SPEED  And that letter hath she delivered, and there an
 :
 :end.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  I would it were no worse.
 :
 :SPEED  I'll warrant you, 'tis as well.
 :For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty
 :Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply,
S:
 :Or fearing else some messenger that might her
 :
 :mind discover,
 :
 :Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto
 :
S:her lover.
 :
 :All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why
 :
 :muse you, sir? 'Tis dinnertime.
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE  I have dined.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Ay, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon love
 :
 :can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by
 :my victuals and would fain have meat. O, be not like
 :your mistress! Be moved, be moved.

 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Lance, weeping, with his dog, Crab.]
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Nay,'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping.
 :All the kind of the Lances have this very fault. I have
S:received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and
 :
 :am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court. I
 :
 :think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that
 :
S:lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my
 :
S:sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing
 :
 :her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity,
 :
 :yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He
 :
S:is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity
 :
 :in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have
 :
 :seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no
 :
 :eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting.
 :Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. [He takes off his
 :shoes.] This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is
 :my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother. Nay,
 :that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is so, it is so; it hath
 :the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is my
S:
 :mother; and this my father. A vengeance on 't, there
 :
 :'tis! Now sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she
 :
 :is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat
 :
 :is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is
 :himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I
 :am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father:
S:"Father, your blessing." Now should not the shoe
 :
 :speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my
 :
 :father. [He kisses one shoe.] Well, he weeps on. Now
 :
 :come I to my mother. O, that she could speak now
 :like a wold woman! Well, I kiss her. [He kisses the
S:other shoe.] Why, there 'tis; here's my mother's
 :
 :breath up and down. Now come I to my sister. Mark
 :
 :the moan she makes! Now the dog all this while
 :
 :sheds not a tear nor speaks a word. But see how I
 :lay the dust with my tears.
 :
 :[Enter Pantino.]
 :
 :
S:
 :PANTINO  Lance, away, away! Aboard. Thy master is
 :
 :shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What's
 :
 :the matter? Why weep'st thou, man? Away, ass.
 :
S:You'll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the
 :
 :unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
S:
 :
 :PANTINO  What's the unkindest tide?
 :
S:
 :
 :LANCE  Why, he that's tied here, Crab my dog.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANTINO  Tut, man. I mean thou 'lt lose the flood and, in
S:losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy
 :
 :voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,
 :
S:lose thy service and, in losing thy service--[Lance
 :
 :covers Pantino's mouth.] Why dost thou stop my
 :
 :mouth?
 :
 :
S:LANCE  For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANTINO  Where should I lose my tongue?
 :
 :
 :LANCE  In thy tale.
 :
S:PANTINO  In thy tail!
 :
 :
 :
S:LANCE  Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,
 :
 :and the service, and the tied. Why, man, if the river
 :
 :were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
 :
 :wind were down, I could drive the boat with my
S:sighs.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANTINO  Come. Come away, man. I was sent to call
 :
 :thee.

S:

S:
 :than live in your air.

S:VALENTINE  You have said, sir.

S:
 :
S:SYLVIA  Who is that, servant?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire.
 :
 :Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your Ladyship's
 :looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your
 :company.
 :
 :THURIO  Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
 :make your wit bankrupt.
S:
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  I know it well, sir. You have an exchequer
 :
S:of words and, I think, no other treasure to give your
 :

 :We have conversed and spent our hours together,
 :
 :And though myself have been an idle truant,
 :Omitting the sweet benefit of time
 :To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
 :Yet hath Sir Proteus--for that's his name--
 :Made use and fair advantage of his days:
 :His years but young, but his experience old;
S:
 :His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;

S:Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,

S:With commendation from great potentates,
 :
 :And here he means to spend his time awhile.

S:I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

S:Upon some other pawn for fealty.
 :

 :Nay, then, he should be blind, and being blind

S:

 :Why, lady, love hath twenty pair of eyes.
 :
S:

S:Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman.

 :
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :Welcome, dear Proteus.--Mistress, I beseech you
 :
 :Confirm his welcome with some special favor.
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
 :If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :Mistress, it is. Sweet lady, entertain him
 :
 :To be my fellow-servant to your Ladyship.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant
 :
 :To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:Leave off discourse of disability.
 :
 :Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :And duty never yet did want his meed.
 :Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA  That you are welcome?
 :
 :PROTEUS  That you are worthless.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Servant.]

 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SERVANT
 :
 :Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
 :
 :
 :

 :Go with me.--Once more, new servant, welcome.
 :I'll leave you to confer of home affairs.
 :When you have done, we look to hear from you.
S:
 :
 :

 :
 :[Sylvia and Thurio exit.]

S:Now tell me, how do all from whence you came?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Your friends are well and have them much
 :commended.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :And how do yours?
 :
S:
 :PROTEUS  I left them all in health.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :How does your lady? And how thrives your love?
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :My tales of love were wont to weary you.
 :I know you joy not in a love discourse.
S:
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now.
 :
 :I have done penance for contemning Love,
 :Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me
S:With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
 :
 :With nightly tears, and daily heartsore sighs,
 :
 :For in revenge of my contempt of love,
 :
 :Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
 :And made them watchers of mine own heart's
 :sorrow.
 :O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord
 :And hath so humbled me as I confess
 :There is no woe to his correction,
S:
 :Nor, to his service, no such joy on Earth.
 :
S:Now, no discourse except it be of love.
 :
 :Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep
 :
 :Upon the very naked name of Love.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
 :Was this the idol that you worship so?
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :Even she. And is she not a heavenly saint?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :No, but she is an earthly paragon.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Call her divine.
 :
S:
 :PROTEUS  I will not flatter her.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
S:O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
 :And I must minister the like to you.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
S:Yet let her be a principality,
 :
 :Sovereign to all the creatures on the Earth.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:Except my mistress.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Sweet, except not any,
 :
 :Except thou wilt except against my love.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:
 :And I will help thee to prefer her too:
 :
 :She shall be dignified with this high honor--
 :
 :To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
 :
S:Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
 :
 :And, of so great a favor growing proud,
 :
 :Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
 :
 :And make rough winter everlastingly.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Why, Valentine, what braggartism is this?
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:
 :Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing
 :
 :To her whose worth makes other worthies
 :
 :nothing.
 :
S:She is alone--
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Then let her alone.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own,
 :And I as rich in having such a jewel
 :As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl,
 :The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
S:
 :Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
 :
 :Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
 :
 :My foolish rival, that her father likes
 :
S:Only for his possessions are so huge,
 :
 :Is gone with her along, and I must after,
 :
 :For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  But she loves you?
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :Ay, and we are betrothed; nay more, our marriage
 :
 :hour,
 :
 :With all the cunning manner of our flight
S:Determined of: how I must climb her window,
 :
 :The ladder made of cords, and all the means
 :
 :Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
 :
 :Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
 :In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Go on before. I shall inquire you forth.
 :I must unto the road to disembark
S:
 :Some necessaries that I needs must use,
 :
S:And then I'll presently attend you.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Will you make haste?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  I will.	[Valentine and Speed exit.]
 :Even as one heat another heat expels,
 :Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
 :So the remembrance of my former love
S:Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
 :
 :Is it mine eye, or Valentine's praise,
 :
S:Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
 :
 :That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
 :
 :She is fair, and so is Julia that I love--
 :
 :That I did love, for now my love is thawed,
 :Which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire
 :Bears no impression of the thing it was.
S:Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
 :
 :And that I love him not as I was wont.
 :
 :O, but I love his lady too too much,
 :
S:And that's the reason I love him so little.
 :
 :How shall I dote on her with more advice
 :
 :That thus without advice begin to love her?
 :
 :'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
 :And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
 :But when I look on her perfections,
 :There is no reason but I shall be blind.
 :If I can check my erring love, I will;
 :If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

 :
S:[Enter Speed and Lance, with his dog, Crab.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  Lance, by mine honesty, welcome to Padua.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
 :
 :welcome. I reckon this always: that a man is never
 :undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
 :place till some certain shot be paid and the Hostess
 :say welcome.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Come on, you madcap. I'll to the alehouse with
 :
 :you presently, where, for one shot of five pence,
 :
 :thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah,
 :how did thy master part with Madam Julia?
 :
 :LANCE  Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted
 :very fairly in jest.
 :
S:
 :SPEED  But shall she marry him?
 :
S:
 :
 :LANCE  No.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  How then? Shall he marry her?
 :
 :LANCE  No, neither.
 :
 :SPEED  What, are they broken?
S:
 :
 :LANCE  No, they are both as whole as a fish.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Why then, how stands the matter with them?
S:
 :
 :LANCE  Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
 :
 :stands well with her.
 :
 :
 :SPEED  What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
 :
 :LANCE  What a block art thou that thou canst not! My
 :staff understands me.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  What thou sayst?
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Ay, and what I do too. Look thee, I'll but lean,
 :and my staff understands me.
 :
 :SPEED  It stands under thee indeed.
 :
S:LANCE  Why, "stand under" and "understand" is all
 :
 :one.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  But tell me true, will 't be a match?
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Ask my dog. If he say "Ay," it will; if he say
 :"No," it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it
 :will.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  The conclusion is, then, that it will.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but
S:by a parable.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  'Tis well that I get it so. But, Lance, how sayst
 :
 :thou that my master is become a notable lover?
 :
S:LANCE  I never knew him otherwise.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Than how?
 :
S:
 :
 :LANCE  A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
S:
 :
 :LANCE  Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn
 :himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the
 :alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not
 :worth the name of a Christian.
 :
 :SPEED  Why?
S:
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Because thou hast not so much charity in thee
 :
 :as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  At thy service.

S:To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn.

S:To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.

 :Love bade me swear, and love bids me forswear.
 :O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,

 :For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Sylvia.
S:I to myself am dearer than a friend,

 :For love is still most precious in itself,
 :
 :And Sylvia--witness heaven that made her fair--
 :
 :Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
 :I will forget that Julia is alive,

S:JULIA
 :
 :Counsel, Lucetta. Gentle girl, assist me;

 :
 :Who art the table wherein all my thoughts

 :How with my honor I may undertake

 :
S:
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Alas, the way is wearisome and long.
 :
 :
 :
S:JULIA
 :
 :A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
 :
 :To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
 :
 :Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
 :And when the flight is made to one so dear,
 :Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Better forbear till Proteus make return.
S:
 :
 :
S:JULIA
 :
 :O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
 :
 :Pity the dearth that I have pined in
 :
 :By longing for that food so long a time.
S:Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
 :
 :Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
 :
 :As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
 :
 :
S:LUCETTA
 :
 :I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
 :
 :But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
 :
 :Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
 :
 :JULIA
 :The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
 :The current that with gentle murmur glides,
S:Thou know'st, being stopped, impatiently doth rage,
 :
 :But when his fair course is not hindered,
 :
 :He makes sweet music with th' enameled stones,
 :
 :Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
 :He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
 :And so by many winding nooks he strays
 :With willing sport to the wild ocean.
S:Then let me go and hinder not my course.
 :
 :I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
 :
 :And make a pastime of each weary step
 :
S:Till the last step have brought me to my love,
 :
 :And there I'll rest as after much turmoil
 :
 :A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :But in what habit will you go along?
 :
 :JULIA
 :Not like a woman, for I would prevent
S:
S:The loose encounters of lascivious men.
 :
 :Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
 :
 :As may beseem some well-reputed page.
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Why, then, your Ladyship must cut your hair.
 :
 :JULIA
 :No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
S:
S:With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
 :
 :To be fantastic may become a youth
 :
 :Of greater time than I shall show to be.
 :
 :
S:LUCETTA
 :
 :What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :That fits as well as "Tell me, good my lord,
 :What compass will you wear your farthingale?"
 :Why, ev'n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.
 :
 :LUCETTA
S:
 :You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Out, out, Lucetta. That will be ill-favored.
 :
S:LUCETTA
 :
 :A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin
 :
 :Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
S:What thou think'st meet and is most mannerly.
 :
 :But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
 :
S:For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
 :
 :I fear me it will make me scandalized.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
S:
 :
 :JULIA  Nay, that I will not.
 :
 :
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :Then never dream on infamy, but go.
 :If Proteus like your journey when you come,
 :No matter who's displeased when you are gone.
 :I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal.
 :
S:
 :JULIA
 :
 :That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear.
 :
 :A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
 :
 :And instances of infinite of love
 :Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :All these are servants to deceitful men.
S:
S:
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Base men that use them to so base effect!
 :
 :But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth.
 :His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
 :His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
 :His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
 :His heart as far from fraud as heaven from Earth.
S:
 :
 :LUCETTA
 :
 :Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him.

 :Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong

 :Only deserve my love by loving him.
 :And presently go with me to my chamber
 :To take a note of what I stand in need of
S:To furnish me upon my longing journey.
 :
 :All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,

S:

 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
S:Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
 :
 :We have some secrets to confer about.	[Thurio exits.]
 :
 :Now tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :My gracious lord, that which I would discover
 :The law of friendship bids me to conceal,
 :But when I call to mind your gracious favors
 :Done to me, undeserving as I am,
S:
 :My duty pricks me on to utter that
 :
 :Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
 :
 :Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend
 :
S:This night intends to steal away your daughter;
 :
 :Myself am one made privy to the plot.
 :
 :I know you have determined to bestow her
 :
 :On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,
 :And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
 :It would be much vexation to your age.
 :Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
 :To cross my friend in his intended drift
 :Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
S:
 :A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
 :
 :Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
 :Which to requite command me while I live.
S:This love of theirs myself have often seen,
 :
 :Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
 :
 :And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
 :
S:Sir Valentine her company and my court.
 :
 :But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
 :
S:And so, unworthily, disgrace the man--
 :
 :A rashness that I ever yet have shunned--
 :
 :I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
 :
 :That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
 :And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
 :Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
 :I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
 :The key whereof myself have ever kept,
 :And thence she cannot be conveyed away.
S:
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
 :
S:How he her chamber-window will ascend
 :
 :And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
 :
 :For which the youthful lover now is gone,
 :
 :And this way comes he with it presently,
 :Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
 :But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
 :That my discovery be not aimed at;
 :For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
S:Hath made me publisher of this pretense.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Upon mine honor, he shall never know
 :That I had any light from thee of this.

 :Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile;
S:
 :I am to break with thee of some affairs
 :

 :'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
 :
S:To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

 :I know it well, my lord, and sure the match
 :Were rich and honorable. Besides, the gentleman
 :Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
 :Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
 :Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
 :
S:
 :DUKE
 :
 :No. Trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,
 :
 :Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
 :
 :Neither regarding that she is my child
S:Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
 :
 :And may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
 :
 :Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,
 :
 :And where I thought the remnant of mine age
 :Should have been cherished by her childlike duty,
 :I now am full resolved to take a wife
 :And turn her out to who will take her in.
 :Then let her beauty be her wedding dower,
 :For me and my possessions she esteems not.
S:

 :For long agone I have forgot to court;
 :
 :Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
 :
 :How and which way I may bestow myself
 :To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :Win her with gifts if she respect not words;
 :
 :Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
 :
 :More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
 :
 :DUKE
 :But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:
 :A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
 :
 :Send her another; never give her o'er,
 :
 :For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
 :
S:If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
 :
 :But rather to beget more love in you.
 :
 :If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,
 :
 :Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone.
 :Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
S:For "get you gone" she doth not mean "away."
 :
S:Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
 :
 :Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
 :
 :That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man
 :
 :If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
 :
 :DUKE
 :But she I mean is promised by her friends
 :Unto a youthful gentleman of worth
 :And kept severely from resort of men,
S:
 :That no man hath access by day to her.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,
 :
 :That no man hath recourse to her by night.
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :What lets but one may enter at her window?
 :
 :DUKE
 :Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
S:
 :And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
 :
 :Without apparent hazard of his life.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Why, then a ladder quaintly made of cords
 :To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
 :Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
S:So bold Leander would adventure it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
 :Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :When would you use it? Pray sir, tell me that.
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :This very night; for love is like a child
 :
 :That longs for everything that he can come by.
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :But hark thee: I will go to her alone;
 :
 :How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
 :Under a cloak that is of any length.
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Ay, my good lord.
 :
S:DUKE  Then let me see thy cloak;
 :
 :I'll get me one of such another length.
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
S:Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
 :I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
 :[Pulling off the cloak, he reveals
 :a rope ladder and a paper.]
 :What letter is this same? What's here? [(Reads.)] To
 :Sylvia.
S:
 :And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
 :
 :I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
 :
 :[Reads.]
 :
 :My thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly,
 :And slaves they are to me that send them flying.
S:O, could their master come and go as lightly,
 :
 :Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are
 :
 :lying.
 :
 :My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,
 :While I, their king, that thither them importune,
 :Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest
S:them,
 :
 :Because myself do want my servants' fortune.
 :
 :I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
 :
 :That they should harbor where their lord should be.
 :What's here?
 :[(Reads.)] Sylvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.
 :'Tis so. And here's the ladder for the purpose.
 :Why, Phaeton--for thou art Merops' son--
 :Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
S:
 :And with thy daring folly burn the world?
 :
 :Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?
 :
 :Go, base intruder, overweening slave,
 :
 :Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
 :And think my patience, more than thy desert,
S:Is privilege for thy departure hence.
 :
S:Thank me for this more than for all the favors
 :
 :Which all too much I have bestowed on thee.
 :
 :But if thou linger in my territories
 :
S:Longer than swiftest expedition
 :
 :Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
 :
 :By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love
 :
 :I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
S:Begone. I will not hear thy vain excuse,
 :
 :But, as thou lov'st thy life, make speed from hence.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :And why not death, rather than living torment?
 :
 :To die is to be banished from myself,
 :
 :And Sylvia is myself; banished from her
 :Is self from self--a deadly banishment.
 :What light is light if Sylvia be not seen?
 :What joy is joy if Sylvia be not by--
 :Unless it be to think that she is by
 :And feed upon the shadow of perfection?
S:
 :Except I be by Sylvia in the night,
 :
 :There is no music in the nightingale.
 :
S:Unless I look on Sylvia in the day,
 :
 :There is no day for me to look upon.
 :
 :She is my essence, and I leave to be
 :
 :If I be not by her fair influence
 :Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive.
 :I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom;
 :Tarry I here, I but attend on death,
 :But fly I hence, I fly away from life.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Proteus and Lance.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
 :
 :LANCE  So-ho, so-ho!
 :
 :PROTEUS  What seest thou?
S:
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Him we go to find. There's not a hair on 's head
 :
 :but 'tis a Valentine.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Valentine?
 :
S:VALENTINE  No.
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS  Who then? His spirit?
 :
 :
 :
S:VALENTINE  Neither.
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS  What then?
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Nothing.
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
 :
 :PROTEUS  Who wouldst thou strike?
 :
 :LANCE  Nothing.
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Villain, forbear.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you--
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Sirrah, I say forbear.--Friend Valentine, a word.
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :My ears are stopped and cannot hear good news,
 :
 :So much of bad already hath possessed them.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
 :For they are harsh, untunable, and bad.
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE  Is Sylvia dead?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  No, Valentine.
 :
S:VALENTINE
 :
 :No Valentine indeed for sacred Sylvia.
 :
 :Hath she forsworn me?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  No, Valentine.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :No Valentine if Sylvia have forsworn me.
 :What is your news?
S:
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Sir, there is a proclamation that you are
 :
S:vanished.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :That thou art banished--O, that's the news--
S:From hence, from Sylvia, and from me thy friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :O, I have fed upon this woe already,
 :And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
 :Doth Sylvia know that I am banished?
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Ay, ay, and she hath offered to the doom--
S:
 :Which unreversed stands in effectual force--
 :
 :A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
 :
 :Those at her father's churlish feet she tendered,
 :
 :With them, upon her knees, her humble self,
 :Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became
 :them
 :As if but now they waxed pale for woe.
S:But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
 :
 :Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears
 :
 :Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
 :
 :But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
 :Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
 :When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
 :That to close prison he commanded her
 :With many bitter threats of biding there.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :No more, unless the next word that thou speak'st
 :
 :Have some malignant power upon my life.
 :
 :If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
 :As ending anthem of my endless dolor.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
S:
 :And study help for that which thou lament'st.
 :
S:Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
 :
S:Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
 :
S:Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
 :
 :Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
 :
 :And manage it against despairing thoughts.
 :
 :Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
 :Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered
 :Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
 :The time now serves not to expostulate.
 :Come, I'll convey thee through the city gate
 :And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
S:
 :Of all that may concern thy love affairs.
 :
 :As thou lov'st Sylvia, though not for thyself,
 :
 :Regard thy danger, and along with me.
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
S:I pray thee, Lance, an if thou seest my boy,
 :
 :Bid him make haste and meet me at the North
 :
 :Gate.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Go, sirrah, find him out.--Come, Valentine.
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :O, my dear Sylvia! Hapless Valentine!
S:
 :[Valentine and Proteus exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :LANCE  I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit
 :
 :to think my master is a kind of a knave, but that's all
 :
 :one if he be but one knave. He lives not now that
 :knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team
 :of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who 'tis I
 :love; and yet 'tis a woman, but what woman I will
 :not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milk-maid; yet 'tis not a
S:maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis a maid, for
 :
 :she is her master's maid and serves for wages. She
 :
S:hath more qualities than a water spaniel, which is
 :
 :much in a bare Christian. [He takes out a piece of
 :
 :paper.] Here is the catalog of her condition.
 :
 :[(Reads.)] Imprimis, She can fetch and carry. Why, a
 :horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch but
 :only carry; therefore is she better than a jade.
 :[(Reads.)] Item, She can milk. Look you, a sweet
 :virtue in a maid with clean hands.
 :
S:
 :[Enter Speed.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  How now, Signior Lance? What news with your
 :Mastership?
 :
S:LANCE  With my master's ship? Why, it is at sea.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What
 :
 :news, then, in your paper?
 :
 :LANCE  The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
 :
 :SPEED  Why, man? How black?
 :
S:
 :LANCE  Why, as black as ink.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Let me read them.
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Fie on thee, jolt-head, thou canst not read.
 :
 :SPEED  Thou liest. I can.
 :
S:
S:LANCE  I will try thee. Tell me this, who begot thee?
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Marry, the son of my grandfather.
 :
 :
 :LANCE  O, illiterate loiterer, it was the son of thy grandmo
 :ther.
 :This proves that thou canst not read.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Come, fool, come. Try me in thy paper.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE, [giving him the paper]  There, and Saint Nicholas
 :be thy speed.
 :
 :SPEED [reads]  Imprimis, She can milk.
 :
 :LANCE  Ay, that she can.
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She brews good ale.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  And thereof comes the proverb: "Blessing of
 :your heart, you brew good ale."
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She can sew.
 :
S:
 :LANCE  That's as much as to say "Can she so?"
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She can knit.
 :
 :
 :LANCE  What need a man care for a stock with a wench,
S:when she can knit him a stock?
 :
 :
 :
S:SPEED  Item, She can wash and scour.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  A special virtue, for then she need not be
 :
 :washed and scoured.
S:
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She can spin.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Then may I set the world on wheels, when she
 :can spin for her living.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She hath many nameless virtues.
 :
 :LANCE  That's as much as to say "bastard virtues," that
S:
 :indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no
 :
 :names.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Here follow her vices.
 :
 :LANCE  Close at the heels of her virtues.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of
S:
 :her breath.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.
 :
 :Read on.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She hath a sweet mouth.
 :
 :LANCE  That makes amends for her sour breath.
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She doth talk in her sleep.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her
 :talk.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She is slow in words.
 :
S:
 :LANCE  O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
 :
 :be slow in words is a woman's only virtue. I pray
 :
 :thee, out with 't, and place it for her chief virtue.
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She is proud.
 :
 :LANCE  Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy and
 :cannot be ta'en from her.
S:
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She hath no teeth.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She is curst.
 :
S:LANCE  Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She will often praise her liquor.
 :
 :
 :LANCE  If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I
 :will, for good things should be praised.
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She is too liberal.
 :
S:
 :LANCE  Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down
 :
 :she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I'll
 :
 :keep shut; now, of another thing she may, and that
 :
S:cannot I help. Well, proceed.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more
 :
 :faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.
 :
 :LANCE  Stop there. I'll have her. She was mine and not
 :mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse
 :that once more.
 :
S:
 :SPEED  Item, She hath more hair than wit.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  "More hair than wit"? It may be; I'll prove it:
 :
S:the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is
 :
 :more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is
 :
 :more than the wit, for the greater hides the less.
 :
 :What's next?
 :
 :SPEED  And more faults than hairs.
 :
 :LANCE  That's monstrous! O, that that were out!
S:
 :
 :SPEED  And more wealth than faults.
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
S:I'll have her, and if it be a match, as nothing is
 :
 :impossible--
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  What then?
 :
S:LANCE  Why, then will I tell thee that thy master stays
 :
 :for thee at the North Gate.
 :
 :
 :
 :SPEED  For me?
 :
S:LANCE  For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stayed for a
 :
 :better man than thee.
 :
S:
 :
 :SPEED  And must I go to him?
 :
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so
 :long that going will scarce serve the turn.
 :
 :SPEED, [handing him the paper]  Why didst not tell me
 :sooner? Pox of your love letters!	[He exits.]
 :
S:
 :LANCE  Now will he be swinged for reading my letter;
 :
 :an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
 :
 :secrets. I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.
 :
S:[He exits.]

 :=======
 :[Enter Duke and Thurio.]
S:
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
 :
 :Now Valentine is banished from her sight.
 :
S:THURIO
 :
S:Since his exile she hath despised me most,
 :
 :Forsworn my company and railed at me,
 :
 :That I am desperate of obtaining her.
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :This weak impress of love is as a figure
 :Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
 :Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
 :A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
S:
 :And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Proteus.]
 :
 :
 :How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,
S:According to our proclamation, gone?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Gone, my good lord.
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :My daughter takes his going grievously.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.
 :
 :Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee,
 :For thou hast shown some sign of good desert,
 :Makes me the better to confer with thee.
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:
 :Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
 :
 :Let me not live to look upon your Grace.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
 :The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?
 :
 :PROTEUS  I do, my lord.
S:
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
 :
S:How she opposes her against my will?
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
 :What might we do to make the girl forget
 :The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:
 :The best way is to slander Valentine
 :
 :With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
 :
 :Three things that women highly hold in hate.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Ay, if his enemy deliver it.
 :Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
 :By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
 :
S:
 :DUKE
 :
 :Then you must undertake to slander him.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do.
 :'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
 :Especially against his very friend.
 :
S:
 :DUKE
 :
 :Where your good word cannot advantage him,
 :
 :Your slander never can endamage him;
 :
 :Therefore the office is indifferent,
S:Being entreated to it by your friend.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it
 :By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
 :She shall not long continue love to him.
 :But say this weed her love from Valentine,
 :It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
 :
S:
 :THURIO
 :
 :Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
 :
 :Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
 :
 :You must provide to bottom it on me,
 :Which must be done by praising me as much
S:As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
 :
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind
 :Because we know, on Valentine's report,
 :You are already Love's firm votary
 :And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
 :Upon this warrant shall you have access
 :Where you with Sylvia may confer at large--
S:
 :For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
 :
 :And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you--
 :
S:Where you may temper her by your persuasion
 :
 :To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :As much as I can do I will effect.--
 :
 :But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough.
 :
 :You must lay lime to tangle her desires
 :By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
 :Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
 :
 :DUKE
 :Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
S:
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Say that upon the altar of her beauty
 :
 :You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart.
 :Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
 :Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
S:That may discover such integrity.
 :
 :For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
 :
 :Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
 :
 :Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans
S:Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
 :
 :After your dire-lamenting elegies,
 :
 :Visit by night your lady's chamber window
 :
 :With some sweet consort; to their instruments
 :Tune a deploring dump; the night's dead silence
S:Will well become such sweet complaining
 :
 :grievance.
 :
 :This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
 :
 :
 :DUKE
 :This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
 :
 :THURIO, [to Proteus]
 :And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.
S:
 :Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
 :
 :Let us into the city presently
 :
S:To sort some gentlemen well-skilled in music.
 :
 :I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
 :
 :To give the onset to thy good advice.
 :
 :
S:DUKE  About it, gentlemen.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
S:We'll wait upon your Grace till after supper
 :
S:And afterward determine our proceedings.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Even now about it! I will pardon you.

S:
 :That's not so, sir. We are your enemies.
 :
 :

 :Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.
 :
 :VALENTINE
S:
 :Then know that I have little wealth to lose.
 :
 :A man I am crossed with adversity;

 :My riches are these poor habiliments,
 :
 :Of which, if you should here disfurnish me,

S:

 :
S:
 :VALENTINE  I was.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND OUTLAW  For what offense?
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :For that which now torments me to rehearse;
 :I killed a man, whose death I much repent,
S:But yet I slew him manfully in fight
 :
 :Without false vantage or base treachery.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST OUTLAW
S:Why, ne'er repent it if it were done so;
 :
 :But were you banished for so small a fault?
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
 :
 :
 :SECOND OUTLAW  Have you the tongues?
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :My youthful travel therein made me happy,
 :Or else I often had been miserable.
S:
 :
 :
 :THIRD OUTLAW
 :
S:By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
 :
 :This fellow were a king for our wild faction.
 :
 :
 :
 :FIRST OUTLAW  We'll have him.--Sirs, a word.
 :[The Outlaws step aside to talk.]
 :
 :SPEED  Master, be one of them. It's an honorable kind
 :of thievery.
 :
S:
 :VALENTINE  Peace, villain.
 :
 :
 :
 :SECOND OUTLAW, [advancing]
 :
 :Tell us this: have you anything to take to?
 :
 :VALENTINE  Nothing but my fortune.
 :
 :THIRD OUTLAW
S:
 :Know then that some of us are gentlemen,
 :
S:Such as the fury of ungoverned youth
 :
 :Thrust from the company of awful men.
 :
 :Myself was from Verona banished
 :
 :For practicing to steal away a lady,
 :An heir and near allied unto the Duke.
 :
 :SECOND OUTLAW
 :And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
 :Who, in my mood, I stabbed unto the heart.
S:
 :
 :
 :FIRST OUTLAW
 :
 :And I for such like petty crimes as these.
 :
 :But to the purpose: for we cite our faults
S:That they may hold excused our lawless lives,
 :
 :And partly seeing you are beautified
 :
 :With goodly shape, and by your own report
 :
 :A linguist, and a man of such perfection
 :As we do in our quality much want--
 :
S:SECOND OUTLAW
 :
 :Indeed because you are a banished man,
 :
S:Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.
 :
 :Are you content to be our general,
 :
 :To make a virtue of necessity
 :
S:And live as we do in this wilderness?
 :
 :
 :
S:THIRD OUTLAW
 :
 :What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
 :
 :Say ay, and be the captain of us all;
 :
 :We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
 :Love thee as our commander and our king.
 :
 :FIRST OUTLAW
 :But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
 :
S:
 :SECOND OUTLAW
 :
 :Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered.
 :
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :
 :I take your offer and will live with you,
 :
 :Provided that you do no outrages
 :On silly women or poor passengers.
 :
 :THIRD OUTLAW
 :No, we detest such vile base practices.
 :Come, go with us; we'll bring thee to our crews
S:
 :And show thee all the treasure we have got,
 :
 :Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

 :Scene 2
 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Proteus.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Already have I been false to Valentine,
 :And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
 :Under the color of commending him,
 :I have access my own love to prefer.
 :But Sylvia is too fair, too true, too holy
 :To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
S:
 :When I protest true loyalty to her,
 :
 :She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
 :
 :When to her beauty I commend my vows,
 :
 :She bids me think how I have been forsworn
 :In breaking faith with Julia, whom I loved;
 :And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
 :The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
S:Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
 :
 :The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
 :
 :But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her
 :
 :window
 :And give some evening music to her ear.
 :
 :[Enter Thurio and Musicians.]
 :
 :
S:
 :THURIO
 :
 :How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love
 :
 :Will creep in service where it cannot go.
 :
 :
 :THURIO
 :Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence.
S:
 :
 :
 :THURIO
 :
 :Who, Sylvia?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Ay, Sylvia, for your sake.
 :
 :THURIO
S:I thank you for your own.--Now, gentlemen,
 :
 :Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Host of the inn, and Julia, disguised as a
 :
 :page, Sebastian. They stand at a distance and talk.]
 :
 :
 :
 :HOST  Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly.
S:I pray you, why is it?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Marry, mine host, because I
 :
 :cannot be merry.
S:
 :
 :HOST  Come, we'll have you merry. I'll bring you where
 :
 :you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you
 :
 :asked for.
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  But shall I hear him speak?
 :
S:HOST  Ay, that you shall.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  That will be music.
 :
S:
 :
 :HOST  Hark, hark.	[Music plays.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Is he among these?
S:
 :
 :HOST  Ay. But peace; let's hear 'em.
 :
 :
 :
 :Song.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS	Who is Sylvia? What is she,
 :That all our swains commend her?
 :Holy, fair, and wise is she;
S:
 :The heaven such grace did lend her
 :
 :That she might admired be.
 :
S:
 :
 :Is she kind as she is fair?
 :
 :For beauty lives with kindness.
 :
S:Love doth to her eyes repair
 :
 :To help him of his blindness;
 :
S:And, being helped, inhabits there.
 :
 :
 :
 :Then to Sylvia let us sing,
 :
 :That Sylvia is excelling;
 :She excels each mortal thing
 :Upon the dull earth dwelling.
 :To her let us garlands bring.
 :
 :
S:
 :HOST  How now? Are you sadder than you were before?
 :
 :How do you, man? The music likes you not.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  You mistake. The musician likes me
 :not.
S:
 :
 :HOST  Why, my pretty youth?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  He plays false, father.
S:
 :
 :HOST  How, out of tune on the strings?
 :
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Not so; but yet so false that he
 :
 :grieves my very heart-strings.
 :
 :
 :HOST  You have a quick ear.
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes
 :me have a slow heart.
 :
S:
 :HOST  I perceive you delight not in music.
 :
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Not a whit when it jars so.
 :
 :
 :
 :HOST  Hark, what fine change is in the music!
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Ay; that change is the spite.
 :
 :HOST  You would have them always play but one
 :thing?
S:
 :
 :
S:JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :I would always have one play but one thing.
 :
 :But, host, doth this Sir Proteus, that we talk on,
 :
 :Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
 :
 :HOST  I tell you what Lance his man told me: he loved
 :her out of all nick.
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Where is Lance?
S:
 :
 :
S:HOST  Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his
 :
 :master's command, he must carry for a present to
 :
 :his lady.	[Music ends.]
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Peace. Stand aside. The company
S:parts.	[Host and Julia move away.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
S:Sir Thurio, fear not you. I will so plead
 :
 :That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
 :
S:
 :
 :THURIO
 :
 :Where meet we?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  At Saint Gregory's well.
 :
 :THURIO  Farewell.
 :[Thurio and the Musicians exit.]
 :
S:
 :[Enter Sylvia, above.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Madam, good even to your Ladyship.
S:
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :
 :I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
 :
 :Who is that that spake?
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
 :
 :You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
 :
S:
 :
 :SYLVIA  Sir Proteus, as I take it.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :What's your will?
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  That I may compass yours.
 :
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :You have your wish: my will is even this,
 :That presently you hie you home to bed.
S:Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man,
 :
 :Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
 :
 :To be seduced by thy flattery,
 :
 :That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
 :Return, return, and make thy love amends.
 :For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
 :I am so far from granting thy request
 :That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
 :And by and by intend to chide myself
S:
 :Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,
 :But she is dead.
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]  'Twere false if I should speak it,
 :
 :For I am sure she is not buried.
 :
 :
S:SYLVIA
 :
 :Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
 :
 :Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,
 :
S:I am betrothed. And art thou not ashamed
 :
 :To wrong him with thy importunacy?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
S:
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :
 :And so suppose am I, for in his grave,
 :
 :Assure thyself, my love is buried.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
 :
S:SYLVIA
 :
 :Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
 :
 :Or, at the least, in hers sepulcher thine.
 :
 :
S:JULIA, [aside]  He heard not that.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
 :Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
 :The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
S:To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep,
 :
 :For since the substance of your perfect self
 :
 :Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
 :
 :And to your shadow will I make true love.
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :If 'twere a substance you would sure deceive it
 :And make it but a shadow, as I am.
 :
S:
 :SYLVIA
 :
 :I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
 :
 :But since your falsehood shall become you well
 :
 :To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
 :Send to me in the morning, and I'll send it.
S:And so, good rest.	[Sylvia exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  As wretches have o'ernight
 :
 :That wait for execution in the morn.	[Proteus exits.]
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Host, will you go?
 :
 :HOST  By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
 :
S:
 :
 :HOST  Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
 :
S:day.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :Not so; but it hath been the longest night
 :That e'er I watched, and the most heaviest.

S:Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,

 :But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,

S:And on the justice of my flying hence

 :To keep me from a most unholy match,

S:Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.

 :I do desire thee, even from a heart

 :Scene 4
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Lance, with his dog, Crab.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :LANCE  When a man's servant shall play the cur with
 :
 :him, look you, it goes hard--one that I brought up
 :
S:of a puppy, one that I saved from drowning when
 :
 :three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went
 :
 :to it. I have taught him even as one would say
 :
 :precisely "Thus I would teach a dog." I was sent to
 :deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my
 :master; and I came no sooner into the dining
S:chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals
 :
 :her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
 :
 :cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have,
 :
 :as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a
S:dog indeed; to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I
 :
 :had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon
 :
 :me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged
 :
 :for 't. Sure as I live, he had suffered for 't. You shall
 :judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of
 :three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke's
 :table; he had not been there--bless the mark!--a
 :pissing while but all the chamber smelt him. "Out
 :with the dog!" says one. "What cur is that?" says
S:
 :another. "Whip him out!" says the third. "Hang him
 :
 :up!" says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with
 :
 :the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to
 :
 :the fellow that whips the dogs. "Friend," quoth I,
 :"You mean to whip the dog?" "Ay, marry, do I,"
S:quoth he. "You do him the more wrong," quoth I.
 :
 :"'Twas I did the thing you wot of." He makes me no
 :
 :more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How
 :
 :many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
 :I'll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he
 :hath stolen; otherwise he had been executed. I have
S:stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed; otherwise
 :
 :he had suffered for 't. [To Crab.] Thou think'st
 :
S:not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you
 :
 :served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia.
 :
S:Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do?
 :
 :When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
 :
 :water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? Didst
 :
 :thou ever see me do such a trick?
 :
 :[Enter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian.]
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:
 :Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
 :
 :And will employ thee in some service presently.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :In what you please. I'll do what I can.
 :
 :PROTEUS
S:I hope thou wilt. [To Lance.] How now, you
 :
 :whoreson peasant?
 :
 :Where have you been these two days loitering?
 :
 :
 :LANCE  Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Sylvia the dog you
 :bade me.
 :
 :PROTEUS  And what says she to my little jewel?
 :
S:
 :LANCE  Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells
 :
 :you currish thanks is good enough for such a
 :
 :present.
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  But she received my dog?
 :
 :LANCE  No, indeed, did she not. Here have I brought
 :him back again.
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  What, didst thou offer her this from me?
 :
 :
 :
S:LANCE  Ay, sir. The other squirrel was stolen from me
 :
 :by the hangman's boys in the market-place, and
 :
 :then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as
 :
 :ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,
 :Or ne'er return again into my sight.
 :Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?
S:
 :[Lance exits with Crab.]
 :
 :A slave that still an end turns me to shame.
 :
 :Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
 :
 :Partly that I have need of such a youth
 :That can with some discretion do my business--
 :For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout--
 :But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
S:Which, if my augury deceive me not,
 :
 :Witness good bringing-up, fortune, and truth.
 :
S:Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.
 :
 :Go presently, and take this ring with thee;
 :
 :Deliver it to Madam Sylvia.
 :
 :She loved me well delivered it to me.
 :[He gives her a ring.]
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
 :She is dead belike?
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Not so; I think she lives.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Alas!
 :
S:PROTEUS  Why dost thou cry "Alas"?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  I cannot choose but pity her.
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :Because methinks that she loved you as well
S:As you do love your lady Sylvia.
 :
 :She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
 :
 :You dote on her that cares not for your love.
 :
 :'Tis pity love should be so contrary,
 :And thinking on it makes me cry "Alas."
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Well, give her that ring and therewithal
 :
 :This letter. [He gives her a paper.] That's her
 :chamber. Tell my lady
 :I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
 :Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
 :Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.
 :[Proteus exits.]
S:
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :How many women would do such a message?
 :
 :Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained
 :A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
 :Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
 :That with his very heart despiseth me?
 :Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
S:
 :Because I love him, I must pity him.
 :
 :This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
 :
 :To bind him to remember my good will;
 :
 :And now am I, unhappy messenger,
 :To plead for that which I would not obtain,
 :To carry that which I would have refused,
S:To praise his faith, which I would have dispraised.
 :
 :I am my master's true confirmed love,
 :
 :But cannot be true servant to my master
 :
S:Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
 :
 :Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
 :
 :As--Heaven it knows!--I would not have him
 :
S:speed.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Sylvia.]
 :
 :
 :[As Sebastian.] Gentlewoman, good day. I pray you be
 :my mean
S:To bring me where to speak with Madam Sylvia.
 :
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :
 :What would you with her, if that I be she?
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :If you be she, I do entreat your patience
 :To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
 :
S:
 :SYLVIA  From whom?
 :
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  From my master, Sir Proteus,
 :
 :madam.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA  O, he sends you for a picture?
 :
S:JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Ay, madam.
 :
 :
 :
S:SYLVIA, [calling]  Ursula, bring my picture there.
 :
 :[She is brought the picture.]
 :
S:Go, give your master this. Tell him from me,
 :
 :One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
 :
 :Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Madam, please you peruse this
 :letter.	[She gives Sylvia a paper.]
 :Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised
S:Delivered you a paper that I should not.
 :
 :This is the letter to your Ladyship.
 :
 :[She takes back the first paper
 :
 :and hands Sylvia another.]
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :I pray thee let me look on that again.
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
S:
 :It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
 :
 :
 :
S:SYLVIA  There, hold.
 :
 :I will not look upon your master's lines;
 :
S:I know they are stuffed with protestations
 :
 :And full of new-found oaths, which he will break
 :
 :As easily as I do tear his paper.
 :
 :[She tears the second paper.]
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :Madam, he sends your Ladyship this ring.
 :[She offers Sylvia a ring.]
 :
S:
 :SYLVIA
 :
S:The more shame for him, that he sends it me;
 :
 :For I have heard him say a thousand times
 :
S:His Julia gave it him at his departure.
 :
 :Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
 :
S:Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  She thanks you.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA  What sayst thou?
 :
S:JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :I thank you, madam, that you tender her;
 :
 :Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.
 :
S:
 :
 :SYLVIA  Dost thou know her?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :Almost as well as I do know myself.
 :To think upon her woes, I do protest
 :That I have wept a hundred several times.
 :
 :SYLVIA
S:
 :Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
 :
 :SYLVIA  Is she not passing fair?
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :She hath been fairer, madam, than she is;
 :
 :When she did think my master loved her well,
 :She, in my judgment, was as fair as you.
 :But since she did neglect her looking-glass
S:And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
 :
S:The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
 :
 :And pinched the lily tincture of her face,
 :
 :That now she is become as black as I.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA  How tall was she?
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :About my stature; for at Pentecost,
 :When all our pageants of delight were played,
S:
 :Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
 :
 :And I was trimmed in Madam Julia's gown,
 :
 :Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
 :
 :As if the garment had been made for me;
 :Therefore I know she is about my height.
 :And at that time I made her weep agood,
S:For I did play a lamentable part;
 :
 :Madam, 'twas Ariadne, passioning
 :
S:For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight,
 :
 :Which I so lively acted with my tears
 :
 :That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
 :
 :Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
 :If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.
 :
S:SYLVIA
 :
 :She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
 :
S:Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
 :
 :I weep myself to think upon thy words.
 :
S:Here, youth, there is my purse.
 :
 :[She gives Julia a purse.]
 :
 :I give thee this
 :
 :For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.
 :Farewell.
S:
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
 :And she shall thank you for 't if e'er you know her.
 :
S:[Sylvia exits.]
 :
 :A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.
 :
 :I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
 :
 :Since she respects my mistress' love so much.--
 :Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
 :Here is her picture; let me see. I think
 :If I had such a tire, this face of mine
 :Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
 :And yet the painter flattered her a little,
S:
 :Unless I flatter with myself too much.
 :
 :Her hair is auburn; mine is perfect yellow;
 :
 :If that be all the difference in his love,
 :
 :I'll get me such a colored periwig.
 :Her eyes are gray as glass, and so are mine.
 :Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
 :What should it be that he respects in her
 :But I can make respective in myself
S:
 :If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
 :
 :Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
 :
 :For 'tis thy rival. O, thou senseless form,
 :
 :Thou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved, and
 :adored;
 :And were there sense in his idolatry,
 :My substance should be statue in thy stead.
 :I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
S:
S:That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,
 :
 :I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes
 :
 :To make my master out of love with thee.

S:

 :
 :THURIO
 :
 :Sir Proteus, what says Sylvia to my suit?
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :O sir, I find her milder than she was,
 :And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
 :
S:
 :THURIO  What? That my leg is too long?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  No, that it is too little.
 :
 :
 :THURIO
 :I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
S:
 :But love will not be spurred to what it loathes.
 :
 :
 :
S:THURIO  What says she to my face?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  She says it is a fair one.
 :
 :
 :THURIO
 :Nay, then the wanton lies; my face is black.
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,
S:
 :Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :
S:'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes,
 :
 :For I had rather wink than look on them.
 :
 :
 :
 :THURIO  How likes she my discourse?
 :
 :PROTEUS  Ill, when you talk of war.
 :
 :THURIO
S:But well when I discourse of love and peace.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :
 :But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
 :
 :THURIO  What says she to my valor?
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS  O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :She needs not when she knows it cowardice.
 :
 :THURIO  What says she to my birth?
 :
 :PROTEUS  That you are well derived.
S:
 :
 :
S:JULIA, [aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool.
 :
 :
 :
 :THURIO  Considers she my possessions?
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  O, ay, and pities them.
 :
S:THURIO  Wherefore?
 :
 :
 :
S:JULIA, [aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :That they are out by lease.
S:
 :
S:JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Here comes the Duke.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Duke.]
 :
 :
 :
S:DUKE
 :
 :How now, Sir Proteus?--How now, Thurio?
 :
 :Which of you saw Eglamour of late?
 :
 :
 :THURIO
 :Not I.
 :
 :PROTEUS  Nor I.
 :
S:
S:DUKE  Saw you my daughter?
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Neither.
 :
S:
 :
 :DUKE
 :
 :Why, then, she's fled unto that peasant, Valentine,
 :
 :And Eglamour is in her company.
 :'Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both
 :As he, in penance, wandered through the forest;
 :Him he knew well and guessed that it was she,
 :But, being masked, he was not sure of it.
 :Besides, she did intend confession
S:
 :At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not.
 :
 :These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
 :
 :Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,
 :
 :But mount you presently and meet with me
 :Upon the rising of the mountain foot
S:That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
 :
 :Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
S:THURIO
 :
 :Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
 :
 :That flies her fortune when it follows her.
 :
 :I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
 :Than for the love of reckless Sylvia.	[He exits.]
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :And I will follow, more for Sylvia's love
 :Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
S:
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA
 :
S:And I will follow, more to cross that love
 :
 :Than hate for Sylvia, that is gone for love.

 :
 :[Enter Valentine.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :How use doth breed a habit in a man!
 :This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
 :I better brook than flourishing peopled towns;
 :Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
S:
 :And to the nightingale's complaining notes
 :
 :Tune my distresses and record my woes.
 :
 :O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
 :
 :Leave not the mansion so long tenantless
 :Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
 :And leave no memory of what it was.
 :Repair me with thy presence, Sylvia;
 :Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
S:
 :[Shouting and sounds of fighting.]
 :
 :What hallowing and what stir is this today?
 :
 :These are my mates, that make their wills their law,

S:

 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Madam, this service I have done for you--
 :Though you respect not aught your servant doth--
 :To hazard life, and rescue you from him
 :That would have forced your honor and your love.
 :Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look;
 :A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
S:
 :And less than this I am sure you cannot give.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE, [aside]
 :
 :How like a dream is this I see and hear!
 :Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :O miserable, unhappy that I am!
S:
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,
 :
 :But by my coming, I have made you happy.
 :
S:SYLVIA
 :
 :By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
 :I would have been a breakfast to the beast
S:
 :Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
 :
 :O heaven, be judge how I love Valentine,
 :
 :Whose life's as tender to me as my soul;
 :
 :And full as much, for more there cannot be,
 :I do detest false perjured Proteus.
 :Therefore begone; solicit me no more.
S:
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :
 :What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
 :
S:Would I not undergo for one calm look!
 :
 :O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
 :
 :When women cannot love where they're beloved.
 :
 :
 :SYLVIA
 :When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
 :Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
 :For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
 :Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
S:
 :Descended into perjury to love me.
 :
 :Thou hast no faith left now unless thou 'dst two,
 :
 :And that's far worse than none; better have none
 :
S:Than plural faith, which is too much by one.
 :
 :Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  In love
S:Who respects friend?
 :
S:
 :
 :SYLVIA  All men but Proteus.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
S:Can no way change you to a milder form,
 :
 :I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
 :
S:And love you 'gainst the nature of love--force you.
 :
 :[He seizes her.]

 :
 :

 :O, heaven!

S:
 :Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
 :
 :Thou friend of an ill fashion.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  Valentine!
 :
 :VALENTINE
 :Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
S:For such is a friend now. Treacherous man,
 :
 :Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
 :
 :Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say
 :
 :I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
 :Who should be trusted when one's right hand
 :Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
 :I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
 :But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
 :The private wound is deepest. O, time most
S:
 :accursed,
 :
 :'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS  My shame and guilt confounds me.
 :Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow
 :Be a sufficient ransom for offense,
S:I tender 't here. I do as truly suffer
 :
 :As e'er I did commit.
 :
 :
 :
 :VALENTINE  Then I am paid,
 :And once again I do receive thee honest.
 :Who by repentance is not satisfied
 :Is nor of heaven nor Earth, for these are pleased;
 :By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeased.
 :And that my love may appear plain and free,
S:
 :All that was mine in Sylvia I give thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [aside]
 :
 :O me unhappy!	[She swoons.]
 :
 :PROTEUS  Look to the boy.
 :
 :VALENTINE  Why, boy!
S:
 :Why, wag, how now? What's the matter? Look up.
 :
 :Speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  O, good sir, my master charged
 :me to deliver a ring to Madam Sylvia, which out of
 :my neglect was never done.
 :
 :PROTEUS  Where is that ring, boy?
S:
 :
 :
 :JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Here 'tis; this is it.
 :
S:[She rises, and hands him a ring.]
 :
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS  How, let me see.
 :
 :Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
 :
 :
 :
S:JULIA, [as Sebastian]
 :
S:O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook.
 :
 :This is the ring you sent to Sylvia.
 :
 :[She offers another ring.]
 :
 :
S:PROTEUS
 :
 :But how cam'st thou by this ring? At my depart
 :
 :I gave this unto Julia.
 :
 :
S:JULIA
 :
 :And Julia herself did give it me,
 :
 :And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
 :
 :[She reveals herself.]
 :
 :PROTEUS  How? Julia!
S:
 :
 :JULIA
 :
 :Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
 :
 :And entertained 'em deeply in her heart.
 :How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
 :O, Proteus, let this habit make thee blush.
 :Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
 :Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
 :In a disguise of love.
S:
 :It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
 :
 :Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
 :
 :
 :
 :PROTEUS
 :"Than men their minds"? 'Tis true. O heaven, were
 :man
S:But constant, he were perfect; that one error
 :
 :Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th'
 :
 :sins;
 :
 :Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
 :What is in Sylvia's face but I may spy
 :More fresh in Julia's, with a constant eye?
S:
 :
 :VALENTINE, [to Julia and Proteus]  Come, come, a
 :
 :hand from either.
 :
 :Let me be blest to make this happy close.
 :'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.

 :I dare thee but to breathe upon my love!

S:
 :Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I.
 :
S:I hold him but a fool that will endanger
 :
 :His body for a girl that loves him not.
 :
 :I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

S:To make such means for her as thou hast done,

 :I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
S:And think thee worthy of an empress' love.

 :Plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit,
 :To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
