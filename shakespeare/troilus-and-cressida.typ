 :A never writer to an ever reader: news.
 :
 :
 :Eternal reader, you have here a new play, never staled
 :with the stage, never clapperclawed with the palms of
 :the vulgar, and yet passing full of the palm comical, for
 :it is a birth of your brain that never undertook anything
 :comical vainly. And were but the vain names of comedies
S:
 :changed for the titles of commodities, or of plays
 :
 :for pleas, you should see all those grand censors, that
 :
 :now style them such vanities, flock to them for the
 :
S:main grace of their gravities, especially this author’s
 :
 :comedies, that are so framed to the life that they serve
 :
 :for the most common commentaries of all the actions
 :
S:of our lives, showing such a dexterity and power of wit
 :
S:that the most displeased with plays are pleased with
 :
 :his comedies. And all such dull and heavy-witted
 :
S:worldlings as were never capable of the wit of a comedy,
 :
 :coming by report of them to his representations,
 :
 :have found that wit there that they never found in
 :
 :themselves and have parted better witted than they
S:came, feeling an edge of wit set upon them more than
 :
 :ever they dreamed they had brain to grind it on. So
 :
S:much and such savored salt of wit is in his comedies
 :
 :that they seem, for their height of pleasure, to be born
 :
 :in that sea that brought forth Venus. Amongst all there
 :
 :is none more witty than this; and had I time, I would
 :comment upon it, though I know it needs not, for so
 :much as will make you think your testern well
 :bestowed, but for so much worth as even poor I know
 :to be stuffed in it. It deserves such a labor as well as the
 :
S:
S:best comedy in Terence or Plautus. And believe this,
 :
 :that when he is gone and his comedies out of sale, you
 :
 :will scramble for them and set up a new English
 :
 :Inquisition. Take this for a warning, and at the peril of
S:your pleasure’s loss, and judgment’s, refuse not nor like
 :
 :this the less for not being sullied with the smoky breath
 :
 :of the multitude, but thank fortune for the scape it
 :
 :hath made amongst you, since by the grand possessors’
 :wills I believe you should have prayed for them rather
 :than been prayed. And so I leave all such to be prayed
 :for, for the states of their wits’ healths, that will not
 :praise it. Vale.

 :PROLOGUE
 :In Troy there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
S:The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
 :
 :Have to the port of Athens sent their ships
 :
 :Fraught with the ministers and instruments
 :
 :Of cruel war. Sixty and nine, that wore
 :Their crownets regal, from th' Athenian bay
 :Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made
 :To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
 :The ravished Helen, Menelaus' queen,
 :With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
S:
 :To Tenedos they come,
 :
 :And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
 :
 :Their warlike fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains
 :
 :The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
S:Their brave pavilions. Priam's six-gated city--
 :
 :Dardan and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
 :
 :And Antenorides--with massy staples
 :
 :And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
 :Spar up the sons of Troy.
 :Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits
 :On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
 :Sets all on hazard. And hither am I come,
S:A prologue armed, but not in confidence
 :
 :Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
 :
 :In like conditions as our argument,
 :
 :To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
 :Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
 :Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
S:To what may be digested in a play.
 :
 :Like, or find fault; do as your pleasures are.
 :
 :Now, good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.

 :
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Pandarus and Troilus.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.
 :Why should I war without the walls of Troy
 :That find such cruel battle here within?
S:Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
 :
 :Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Will this gear ne'er be mended?
 :
 :TROILUS
S:The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
 :
 :Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
 :
 :But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
 :
 :Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
 :Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
 :And skilless as unpracticed infancy.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Well, I have told you enough of this. For my
 :part, I'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will
S:
 :have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Have I not tarried?
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the
 :
 :bolting.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Have I not tarried?
 :
S:PANDARUS  Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the
 :
 :leavening.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Still have I tarried.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
 :hereafter the kneading, the making of the cake, the
 :heating the oven, and the baking. Nay, you must stay
S:the cooling too, or you may chance burn your lips.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
S:Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do.
 :
 :At Priam's royal table do I sit
 :
S:And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts--
 :
 :So, traitor! "When she comes"? When is she
 :
 :thence?
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever
 :
 :I saw her look, or any woman else.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
S:I was about to tell thee: when my heart,
 :
 :As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
 :
 :Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
 :
 :I have, as when the sun doth light a-scorn,
 :Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile;
 :But sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness
 :Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
 :
 :PANDARUS  An her hair were not somewhat darker than
S:
 :Helen's--well, go to--there were no more comparison
 :
 :between the women. But, for my part, she is
 :
 :my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise
 :
 :her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday,
S:as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's
 :
 :wit, but--
 :
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :O, Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus:
 :
 :When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned,
S:Reply not in how many fathoms deep
 :
S:They lie indrenched. I tell thee I am mad
 :
 :In Cressid's love. Thou answer'st she is fair;
 :
 :Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart
 :
 :Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;
 :Handiest in thy discourse--O--that her hand,
 :In whose comparison all whites are ink
S:Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
 :
 :The cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense
 :
 :Hard as the palm of plowman. This thou tell'st me,
 :
 :As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her.
 :But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm
 :Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
 :The knife that made it.
 :
 :PANDARUS  I speak no more than truth.
S:
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Thou dost not speak so much.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she
 :is. If she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
 :not, she has the mends in her own hands.
 :
S:TROILUS  Good Pandarus--how now, Pandarus?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I have had my labor for my travail, ill thought
 :
 :on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between
S:and between, but small thanks for my labor.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with
 :
 :me?
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not
 :
 :so fair as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she
 :
 :would be as fair o' Friday as Helen is on Sunday.
 :But what care I? I care not an she were a blackamoor;
 :'tis all one to me.
 :
 :TROILUS  Say I she is not fair?
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  I do not care whether you do or no. She's a
 :
 :fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks,
 :
 :and so I'll tell her the next time I see her. For my
 :
 :part, I'll meddle nor make no more i' th' matter.
 :
 :TROILUS  Pandarus--
 :
 :PANDARUS  Not I.
S:
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Sweet Pandarus--
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  Pray you speak no more to me. I will leave
 :
 :all as I found it, and there an end.	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[Sound alarum.]
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!
 :
 :Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair
 :When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
 :I cannot fight upon this argument;
S:It is too starved a subject for my sword.
 :
 :But Pandarus--O gods, how do you plague me!
 :
 :I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,
 :
S:And he's as tetchy to be wooed to woo
 :
 :As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
 :
 :Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphnes love,
 :
 :What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we.
 :Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl.
 :Between our Ilium and where she resides,
 :Let it be called the wild and wand'ring flood,
 :Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
 :Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.

S:

 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :How now, Prince Troilus? Wherefore not afield?
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Because not there. This woman's answer sorts,
 :
 :For womanish it is to be from thence.
 :What news, Aeneas, from the field today?
 :
 :AENEAS
 :That Paris is returned home, and hurt.
 :
S:
 :TROILUS
 :
 :By whom, Aeneas?
 :
 :
 :
S:AENEAS  Troilus, by Menelaus.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Let Paris bleed. 'Tis but a scar to scorn;
 :Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
 :[Alarum.]
S:
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :Hark what good sport is out of town today!
 :
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :Better at home, if "would I might" were "may."
 :
S:But to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :In all swift haste.
 :
 :TROILUS  Come, go we then together.

S:
 :=======
 :
 :[Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Who were those went by?
 :
 :ALEXANDER  Queen Hecuba and Helen.
S:
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA
 :
 :And whither go they?
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXANDER  Up to the eastern tower,
 :Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
S:To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
 :
 :Is as a virtue fixed, today was moved.
 :
 :He chid Andromache and struck his armorer;
 :
 :And, like as there were husbandry in war,
 :Before the sun rose he was harnessed light,
 :And to the field goes he, where every flower
 :Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
 :In Hector's wrath.
 :
S:
S:CRESSIDA  What was his cause of anger?
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXANDER
 :
 :The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
 :A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector.
 :They call him Ajax.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Good; and what of him?
 :
 :
 :
 :ALEXANDER
 :
 :They say he is a very man per se
S:And stands alone.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  So do all men unless they are drunk, sick,
 :
 :or have no legs.
 :
S:ALEXANDER  This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts
 :
 :of their particular additions. He is as valiant as the
 :
 :lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant, a
 :
 :man into whom nature hath so crowded humors
 :that his valor is crushed into folly, his folly sauced
 :with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that
 :he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint
 :but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy
 :without cause and merry against the hair. He hath
S:
 :the joints of everything, but everything so out of
 :
 :joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and
 :
 :no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  But how should this man that makes me
 :
 :smile make Hector angry?
 :
 :
 :ALEXANDER  They say he yesterday coped Hector in the
 :battle and struck him down, the disdain and
 :shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting
 :and waking.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Pandarus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Who comes here?
 :
S:
 :
 :ALEXANDER  Madam, your Uncle Pandarus.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Hector's a gallant man.
 :
S:ALEXANDER  As may be in the world, lady.
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  What's that? What's that?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Good morrow, Uncle Pandarus.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Good morrow, Cousin Cressid. What do you
 :talk of?-- Good morrow, Alexander.--How do you,
 :cousin? When were you at Ilium?
 :
 :CRESSIDA  This morning, uncle.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  What were you talking of when I came?
 :
 :Was Hector armed and gone ere you came to
 :
 :Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
 :
 :PANDARUS  E'en so. Hector was stirring early.
S:
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  That were we talking of, and of his anger.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Was he angry?
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  So he says here.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  True, he was so. I know the cause too. He'll
 :
 :lay about him today, I can tell them that; and
S:there's Troilus will not come far behind him. Let
 :
 :them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  What, is he angry too?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of
 :the two.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O Jupiter, there's no comparison.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do
 :
 :you know a man if you see him?
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not
 :Hector.
 :
 :PANDARUS  No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  So he is.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  He is not Hector.
S:
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  Himself? No, he's not himself. Would he
 :
 :were himself! Well, the gods are above. Time must
 :
 :friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart
 :
 :were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man
 :than Troilus.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Excuse me.
 :
 :PANDARUS  He is elder.
S:
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Pardon me, pardon me.
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  Th' other's not come to 't. You shall tell me
 :
 :another tale when th' other's come to 't. Hector
 :
S:shall not have his wit this year.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  He shall not need it, if he have his own.
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  Nor his qualities.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  No matter.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Nor his beauty.
S:
 :
S:CRESSIDA  'Twould not become him. His own 's better.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself
 :
 :swore th' other day that Troilus, for a brown favor--
 :for so 'tis, I must confess--not brown neither--
 :
S:CRESSIDA  No, but brown.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  To say the truth, true and not true.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  She praised his complexion above Paris'.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Why, Paris hath color enough.
 :
 :PANDARUS  So he has.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Then Troilus should have too much. If she
S:
 :praised him above, his complexion is higher than
 :
 :his. He having color enough, and the other higher,
 :
 :is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I
 :
S:had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended
 :
 :Troilus for a copper nose.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better
 :than Paris.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
 :
S:PANDARUS  Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him
 :
 :th' other day into the compassed window--and
 :
S:you know he has not past three or four hairs on his
 :
 :chin--
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring
 :
S:his particulars therein to a total.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Why, he is very young, and yet will he within
 :
S:three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she
S:came and puts me her white hand to his cloven
 :
 :chin--
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Why, you know 'tis dimpled. I think his
 :smiling becomes him better than any man in all
 :Phrygia.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O, he smiles valiantly.
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Does he not?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Why, go to, then. But to prove to you that
 :Helen loves Troilus--
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Troilus will stand to the proof if you'll
S:
 :prove it so.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Troilus? Why, he esteems her no more than
 :
S:I esteem an addle egg.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  If you love an addle egg as well as you love
 :
 :an idle head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
 :
S:PANDARUS  I cannot choose but laugh to think how she
 :
 :tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvellous
 :
 :white hand, I must needs confess--
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Without the rack.
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  And she takes upon her to spy a white hair
 :
 :on his chin.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
 :
 :PANDARUS  But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba
 :laughed that her eyes ran o'er--
 :
S:
 :CRESSIDA  With millstones.
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  And Cassandra laughed--
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  But there was a more temperate fire under
S:the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o'er too?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  And Hector laughed.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  At what was all this laughing?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on
 :Troilus' chin.
 :
S:
 :CRESSIDA  An 't had been a green hair, I should have
 :
S:laughed too.
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  They laughed not so much at the hair as at
 :
 :his pretty answer.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  What was his answer?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Quoth she "Here's but two-and-fifty hairs
 :on your chin, and one of them is white."
 :
 :CRESSIDA  This is her question.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  That's true, make no question of that. "Two-and-fi
 :fty
 :
 :hairs," quoth he, "and one white. That
 :white hair is my father, and all the rest are his
 :sons." "Jupiter!" quoth she, "which of these hairs
 :is Paris, my husband?" "The forked one," quoth he.
 :"Pluck 't out, and give it him." But there was such
 :laughing, and Helen so blushed, and Paris so
S:
 :chafed, and all the rest so laughed that it passed.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  So let it now, for it has been a great while
 :
 :going by.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday.
 :Think on 't.
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  So I do.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I'll be sworn 'tis true. He will weep you an
 :'twere a man born in April.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  And I'll spring up in his tears an 'twere a nettle
 :
 :
 :against May.	[Sound a retreat.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Hark, they are coming from the field. Shall
 :we stand up here and see them as they pass toward
 :Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  At your pleasure.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Here, here, here's an excellent place. Here
 :
S:we may see most bravely. I'll tell you them all by
 :
 :their names as they pass by, but mark Troilus
 :
S:above the rest.
 :
 :[They cross the stage; Alexander exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Speak not so loud.
 :
 :[Enter Aeneas and crosses the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's
 :
 :one of the flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark
 :
 :Troilus; you shall see anon.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Antenor and crosses the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Who's that?
 :
 :PANDARUS  That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can
 :tell you, and he's a man good enough. He's one o'
S:
 :th' soundest judgments in Troy whosoever; and a
 :
 :proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I'll
 :
 :show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see
 :
 :him nod at me.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Will he give you the nod?
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  You shall see.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  If he do, the rich shall have more.
S:
 :
 :[Enter Hector and crosses the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  That's Hector, that, that, look you, that.
 :There's a fellow!--Go thy way, Hector!--There's a
S:brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he
 :
 :looks. There's a countenance! Is 't not a brave man?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O, a brave man!
 :
 :PANDARUS  Is he not? It does a man's heart good. Look
 :you what hacks are on his helmet. Look you yonder,
 :do you see? Look you there. There's no jesting;
 :there's laying on, take 't off who will, as they say.
S:
 :There be hacks.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Be those with swords?
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Swords, anything, he cares not. An the devil
S:come to him, it's all one. By God's lid, it does one's
 :
 :heart good.
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Paris and crosses the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris! Look you
 :yonder, niece. Is 't not a gallant man too? Is 't not?
 :Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt
 :home today? He's not hurt. Why, this will do
 :Helen's heart good now, ha? Would I could see
S:
 :Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Helenus and crosses the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Who's that?
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is.
 :
 :That's Helenus. I think he went not forth today.
 :
 :That's Helenus.
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Can Helenus fight, uncle?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Helenus? No. Yes, he'll fight indifferent
 :well. I marvel where Troilus is. Hark, do you not
 :hear the people cry "Troilus"? Helenus is a priest.
 :
 :[Enter Troilus and crosses the stage.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Where? Yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis
 :
 :Troilus! There's a man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus,
 :
 :the prince of chivalry!
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Peace, for shame, peace.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Mark him. Note him. O brave Troilus! Look
 :well upon him, niece. Look you how his sword is
S:
 :bloodied and his helm more hacked than Hector's,
 :
 :and how he looks, and how he goes. O admirable
 :
 :youth! He never saw three and twenty.--Go thy
 :
S:way, Troilus; go thy way!--Had I a sister were a
 :
 :Grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take his
 :
 :choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to
 :
 :him; and I warrant Helen, to change, would give
S:an eye to boot.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Common Soldiers and cross the stage.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Here comes more.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Asses, fools, dolts, chaff and bran, chaff and
S:
 :bran, porridge after meat. I could live and die in
 :
S:the eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look; the
 :
 :eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws!
 :
 :I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
 :
 :Agamemnon and all Greece.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better
S:man than Troilus.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Well, well.
 :
S:PANDARUS  "Well, well"? Why, have you any discretion?
 :
 :Have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is
 :
S:not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
 :
 :learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality and
 :
 :such-like the spice and salt that season a man?
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Ay, a minced man; and then to be baked with
 :
 :no date in the pie, for then the man's date is out.
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  You are such a woman a man knows not at
 :
 :what ward you lie.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Upon my back to defend my belly, upon my
 :wit to defend my wiles, upon my secrecy to defend
S:mine honesty, my mask to defend my beauty, and
 :
 :you to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie,
 :
 :at a thousand watches.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Say one of your watches.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Nay, I'll watch you for that, and that's one of
 :the chiefest of them too. If I cannot ward what I
 :would not have hit, I can watch you for telling how
S:
 :I took the blow--unless it swell past hiding, and
 :
 :then it's past watching.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  You are such another!
 :
 :[Enter Troilus's Boy.]
 :
S:
 :
 :BOY  Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Where?
 :
 :BOY  At your own house. There he unarms him.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Good boy, tell him I come.	[Boy exits.]
S:I doubt he be hurt.--Fare you well, good niece.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Adieu, uncle.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I will be with you, niece, by and by.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  To bring, uncle?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Ay, a token from Troilus.
S:
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  By the same token, you are a bawd.
 :
 :[Pandarus exits.]
 :
S:Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice
 :
 :He offers in another's enterprise;
 :
 :But more in Troilus thousandfold I see
 :
 :Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be.
 :Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing;
 :Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
 :That she beloved knows naught that knows not this:
 :Men prize the thing ungained more than it is.
S:That she was never yet that ever knew
 :
 :Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
 :
 :Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
 :
 :Achievement is command; ungained, beseech.
 :Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
S:Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
 :
 :[She exits.]

 :Scene 3
 :=======
S:[Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes,
 :
 :Menelaus, with others.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
S:Princes, what grief hath set the jaundice o'er your
 :
 :cheeks?
 :
 :The ample proposition that hope makes
 :
 :In all designs begun on Earth below
 :Fails in the promised largeness. Checks and disasters
S:Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,
 :
 :As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
 :
 :Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain
 :
 :Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
 :Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
 :That we come short of our suppose so far
 :That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand,
 :Sith every action that hath gone before,
 :Whereof we have record, trial did draw
S:
 :Bias and thwart, not answering the aim
 :
 :And that unbodied figure of the thought
 :
 :That gave 't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
 :
S:Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works
 :
 :And call them shames, which are indeed naught else
 :
 :But the protractive trials of great Jove
 :
 :To find persistive constancy in men?
 :The fineness of which metal is not found
 :In Fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
 :The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
 :The hard and soft seem all affined and kin.
S:But in the wind and tempest of her frown,
 :
 :Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
 :
 :Puffing at all, winnows the light away,
 :
 :And what hath mass or matter by itself
 :Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
 :
 :NESTOR
 :With due observance of thy godlike seat,
 :Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
S:
 :Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
 :
S:Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,
 :
 :How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
 :
 :Upon her patient breast, making their way
 :
 :With those of nobler bulk!
 :But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
S:The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
 :
S:The strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut,
 :
 :Bounding between the two moist elements,
 :
 :Like Perseus' horse. Where's then the saucy boat
 :
 :Whose weak untimbered sides but even now
S:Corrivaled greatness? Either to harbor fled
 :
 :Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
 :
 :Doth valor's show and valor's worth divide
 :
 :In storms of Fortune. For in her ray and brightness
 :The herd hath more annoyance by the breese
 :Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind
 :Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
 :And flies flee under shade, why, then the thing of
 :courage,
S:
 :As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathize,
 :
 :And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
 :
 :Retorts to chiding Fortune.
 :
S:
 :
 :ULYSSES  Agamemnon,
 :
 :Thou great commander, nerves and bone of Greece,
 :
 :Heart of our numbers, soul and only sprite,
S:In whom the tempers and the minds of all
 :
 :Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
 :
 :Besides th' applause and approbation,
 :
 :The which, [(to Agamemnon)] most mighty for thy
S:place and sway,
 :
 :[(To Nestor)] And thou most reverend for thy
 :
S:stretched-out life,
 :
 :I give to both your speeches, which were such
 :
 :As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
 :
S:Should hold up high in brass; and such again
 :
 :As venerable Nestor, hatched in silver,
 :
 :Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree
 :
 :On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
 :To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
S:Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :Speak, Prince of Ithaca, and be 't of less expect
 :That matter needless, of importless burden,
 :Divide thy lips than we are confident
 :When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws
 :We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.
 :
S:
 :ULYSSES
 :
S:Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
 :
 :And the great Hector's sword had lacked a master
 :
 :But for these instances:
 :
S:The specialty of rule hath been neglected,
 :
S:And look how many Grecian tents do stand
 :
 :Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
 :
 :When that the general is not like the hive
 :
 :To whom the foragers shall all repair,
 :What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
 :Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
 :The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center
 :Observe degree, priority, and place,
 :Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
S:
 :Office, and custom, in all line of order.
 :
 :And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
 :
 :In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
 :
 :Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye
 :Corrects the influence of evil planets,
S:And posts, like the commandment of a king,
 :
 :Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets
 :
 :In evil mixture to disorder wander,
 :
 :What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,
 :What raging of the sea, shaking of Earth,
 :Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors
S:Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
 :
 :The unity and married calm of states
 :
 :Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaked,
 :
 :Which is the ladder of all high designs,
 :The enterprise is sick. How could communities,
 :Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
 :Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
 :The primogeneity and due of birth,
 :Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,
S:
 :But by degree stand in authentic place?
 :
 :Take but degree away, untune that string,
 :
 :And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets
 :
 :In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters
 :Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
S:And make a sop of all this solid globe;
 :
 :Strength should be lord of imbecility,
 :
S:And the rude son should strike his father dead;
 :
 :Force should be right, or, rather, right and wrong,
 :
 :Between whose endless jar justice resides,
 :
 :Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
 :Then everything includes itself in power,
S:Power into will, will into appetite,
 :
 :And appetite, an universal wolf,
 :
 :So doubly seconded with will and power,
 :
S:Must make perforce an universal prey
 :
 :And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
 :
 :This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
 :
 :Follows the choking.
S:And this neglection of degree it is
 :
 :That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
 :
 :It hath to climb. The General's disdained
 :
 :By him one step below, he by the next,
 :That next by him beneath; so every step,
 :Exampled by the first pace that is sick
 :Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
 :Of pale and bloodless emulation.
S:And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
 :
 :Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
 :
 :Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :Most wisely hath Ulysses here discovered
S:The fever whereof all our power is sick.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
 :What is the remedy?
 :
S:ULYSSES
 :
S:The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
 :
 :The sinew and the forehand of our host,
 :
 :Having his ear full of his airy fame,
 :
 :Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
 :Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus,
 :Upon a lazy bed, the live-long day
 :Breaks scurril jests,
S:And with ridiculous and silly action,
 :
 :Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
 :
 :He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
 :
 :Thy topless deputation he puts on,
 :And, like a strutting player whose conceit
S:Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
 :
 :To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
 :
S:'Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage,
 :
 :Such to-be-pitied and o'erwrested seeming
 :
 :He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,
 :
S:'Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared
 :
 :Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped
 :
 :Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,
 :
 :The large Achilles, on his pressed bed lolling,
S:From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,
 :
 :Cries "Excellent! 'Tis Agamemnon right.
 :
 :Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,
 :
 :As he being dressed to some oration."
 :That's done, as near as the extremest ends
 :Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;
 :Yet god Achilles still cries "Excellent!
 :'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
 :Arming to answer in a night alarm."
S:
 :And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
 :
 :Must be the scene of mirth--to cough and spit,
 :
 :And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,
 :
 :Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport
 :Sir Valor dies, cries "O, enough, Patroclus,
 :Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
 :In pleasure of my spleen." And in this fashion,
S:All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
 :
 :Severals and generals of grace exact,
 :
 :Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
 :
 :Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
 :Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
S:As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
 :And in the imitation of these twain,
 :Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
 :With an imperial voice, many are infect:
 :Ajax is grown self-willed and bears his head
 :In such a rein, in full as proud a place
S:As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,
 :
 :Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
 :
S:Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites--
 :
S:A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint--
 :
 :To match us in comparisons with dirt,
 :
 :To weaken and discredit our exposure,
 :
 :How rank soever rounded in with danger.
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:They tax our policy and call it cowardice,
 :
 :Count wisdom as no member of the war,
 :
 :Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
 :
 :But that of hand. The still and mental parts
 :That do contrive how many hands shall strike
 :When fitness calls them on and know by measure
 :Of their observant toil the enemy's weight--
 :Why, this hath not a fingers dignity.
 :They call this bed-work, mapp'ry, closet war;
S:
 :So that the ram that batters down the wall,
 :
 :For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
 :
S:They place before his hand that made the engine
 :
 :Or those that with the fineness of their souls
 :
S:By reason guide his execution.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
 :Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
 :Makes many Thetis' sons.	[Tucket.]
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.
 :
 :MENELAUS  From Troy.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Enter Aeneas, with a Trumpeter.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  What would you 'fore our tent?
 :
 :
S:AENEAS
 :
 :Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Even this.
 :
 :AENEAS
 :May one that is a herald and a prince
 :Do a fair message to his kingly eyes?
 :
S:
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
 :
 :'Fore all the Greekish host, which with one voice
 :
 :Call Agamemnon head and general.
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Fair leave and large security. How may
 :A stranger to those most imperial looks
S:
 :Know them from eyes of other mortals?
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  How?
 :
S:
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :Ay. I ask that I might waken reverence
 :
 :And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
S:Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
 :
 :The youthful Phoebus.
 :
 :Which is that god in office, guiding men?
 :
 :Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
 :
S:AGAMEMNON
 :
 :This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy
 :
 :Are ceremonious courtiers.
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarmed,
S:As bending angels--that's their fame in peace.
 :
 :But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
 :
 :Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and--great
 :
 :Jove's accord--
 :Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas.
 :Peace, Trojan. Lay thy finger on thy lips.
 :The worthiness of praise distains his worth
 :If that the praised himself bring the praise forth.
 :But what the repining enemy commends,
S:
S:That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure,
 :
 :transcends.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
 :
S:AENEAS  Ay, Greek, that is my name.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  What's your affair, I pray you?
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Sir, pardon. 'Tis for Agamemnon's ears.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
S:
 :
 :
S:AENEAS
 :
 :Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.
 :
 :I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
 :
 :To set his sense on the attentive bent,
 :And then to speak.
S:
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Speak frankly as the wind;
 :
 :It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour.
 :
 :That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,
 :He tells thee so himself.
 :
 :AENEAS  Trumpet, blow loud!
 :Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
 :And every Greek of mettle, let him know
S:
S:What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
 :
 :[Sound trumpet.]
 :
 :We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
 :
 :A prince called Hector--Priam is his father--
 :Who in this dull and long-continued truce
 :Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet
S:And to this purpose speak: "Kings, princes, lords,
 :
 :If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
 :
 :That holds his honor higher than his ease,
 :
 :That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
 :That knows his valor and knows not his fear,
 :That loves his mistress more than in confession
 :With truant vows to her own lips he loves
 :And dare avow her beauty and her worth
S:In other arms than hers--to him this challenge.
 :
 :Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
 :
 :Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
 :
 :He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer
 :Than ever Greek did couple in his arms
 :And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,
 :Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
 :To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.
 :If any come, Hector shall honor him;
S:
 :If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires
 :
 :The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
 :
 :The splinter of a lance." Even so much.
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
 :If none of them have soul in such a kind,
 :We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,
S:
 :And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
 :
 :That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
 :
 :If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
 :
 :That one meets Hector. If none else, I am he.
 :
 :NESTOR, [to Aeneas]
 :Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
S:When Hector's grandsire sucked. He is old now,
 :
 :But if there be not in our Grecian host
 :
 :A noble man that hath one spark of fire
 :
S:To answer for his love, tell him from me
 :
S:I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
 :
 :And in my vambrace put my withered brawns
 :
 :And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady
 :
 :Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
 :As may be in the world. His youth in flood,
 :I'll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!
S:
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
S:AGAMEMNON
 :
 :Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand.
 :
 :To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
 :
 :Achilles shall have word of this intent;
 :So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent.
 :Yourself shall feast with us before you go,
 :And find the welcome of a noble foe.
 :[All but Ulysses and Nestor exit.]
 :
S:
 :ULYSSES  Nestor.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  What says Ulysses?
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :I have a young conception in my brain;
 :Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
 :
S:
 :NESTOR  What is 't?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  This 'tis:
 :
 :Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride
 :That hath to this maturity blown up
S:In rank Achilles must or now be cropped
 :
 :Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
 :
 :To overbulk us all.
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  Well, and how?
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
 :However it is spread in general name,
S:
 :Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
 :
S:
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
 :True. The purpose is perspicuous as substance
 :
 :Whose grossness little characters sum up;
S:And, in the publication, make no strain
 :
 :But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
 :
 :As banks of Libya--though, Apollo knows,
 :
 :'Tis dry enough--will, with great speed of judgment,
 :Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
 :Pointing on him.
S:
 :
 :ULYSSES  And wake him to the answer, think you?
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :Why, 'tis most meet. Who may you else oppose
 :That can from Hector bring his honor off
S:If not Achilles? Though 't be a sportful combat,
 :
 :Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,
 :
 :For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
 :
 :With their fin'st palate. And, trust to me, Ulysses,
 :Our imputation shall be oddly poised
 :In this vile action. For the success,
 :Although particular, shall give a scantling
 :Of good or bad unto the general;
 :And in such indexes, although small pricks
S:
 :To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
 :
S:The baby figure of the giant mass
 :
 :Of things to come at large. It is supposed
 :
S:He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
 :
 :And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
 :
 :Makes merit her election and doth boil,
 :
 :As 'twere from forth us all, a man distilled
 :Out of our virtues, who, miscarrying,
 :What heart receives from hence a conquering part
 :To steel a strong opinion to themselves?--
S:Which entertained, limbs are his instruments,
 :
S:In no less working than are swords and bows
 :
 :Directive by the limbs.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:Give pardon to my speech: therefore 'tis meet
 :
 :Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants
 :
 :First show foul wares and think perchance they'll sell;
 :
 :If not, the luster of the better shall exceed
S:By showing the worse first. Do not consent
 :
 :That ever Hector and Achilles meet,
 :
 :For both our honor and our shame in this
 :
 :Are dogged with two strange followers.
 :
 :NESTOR
S:I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
S:Were he not proud, we all should share with him;
 :
S:But he already is too insolent,
 :
 :And it were better parch in Afric sun
 :
 :Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
 :
 :Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,
 :Why then we do our main opinion crush
 :In taint of our best man. No, make a lott'ry,
 :And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
 :The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves
 :Give him allowance for the better man,
S:
 :For that will physic the great Myrmidon,
 :
S:Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
 :
 :His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
 :
 :If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
 :
 :We'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
 :Yet go we under our opinion still
S:That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
 :
 :Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
 :
 :Ajax employed plucks down Achilles' plumes.
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,
 :And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
 :To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.
 :Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone
S:
 :Must tar the mastiffs on, as 'twere a bone.

 :over, generally?
 :
 :AJAX  Thersites!
 :
S:

 :
S:
 :
 :AJAX  Dog!
 :
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  Then there would come some matter
 :
S:from him. I see none now.
 :
 :
 :
S:AJAX  Thou bitchwolf's son, canst thou not hear? Feel,

 :then.	[Strikes him.]
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
 :beef-witted lord!
S:
 :
S:AJAX  Speak, then, thou unsalted leaven, speak. I will
 :
 :beat thee into handsomeness.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness,
S:but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration
 :
 :than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst
 :
 :strike, canst thou? A red murrain o' thy jade's tricks.
 :
 :
S:AJAX  Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest
 :
 :me thus?
S:
 :
 :AJAX  The proclamation!
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
 :
 :AJAX  Do not, porpentine, do not. My fingers itch.
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  I would thou didst itch from head to foot,
 :
S:and I had the scratching of thee; I would make
 :
 :thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou
 :
 :art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as
 :
 :another.
S:
 :
 :AJAX  I say, the proclamation!
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Thou grumblest and railest every hour on
S:Achilles, and thou art as full of envy at his greatness
 :
 :as Cerberus is at Proserpina's beauty, ay, that
 :
 :thou bark'st at him.
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Mistress Thersites!
 :
 :THERSITES  Thou shouldst strike him--
 :
 :AJAX  Cobloaf!
S:
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  He would pound thee into shivers with his
 :
 :fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  You whoreson cur!	[Strikes him.]
 :
S:THERSITES  Do, do.
 :
S:
 :
 :AJAX  Thou stool for a witch!
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Ay, do, do, thou sodden-witted lord. Thou
 :hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an
 :asinego may tutor thee, thou scurvy-valiant ass.
 :Thou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art
 :bought and sold among those of any wit, like a
S:barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin
 :
 :at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou
 :
 :thing of no bowels, thou.
 :
 :
 :AJAX  You dog!
 :
S:THERSITES  You scurvy lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  You cur!	[Strikes him.]
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness, do, camel, do,
 :do.
 :
 :[Enter Achilles and Patroclus.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
S:ACHILLES  Why, how now, Ajax? Wherefore do you
 :
 :thus?--How now, Thersites? What's the matter,
 :
 :man?
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  You see him there, do you?
 :
 :ACHILLES  Ay, what's the matter?
 :
 :THERSITES  Nay, look upon him.
S:
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  So I do. What's the matter?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Nay, but regard him well.
 :
S:ACHILLES  Well, why, so I do.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  But yet you look not well upon him, for
 :
 :whosomever you take him to be, he is Ajax.
 :
 :ACHILLES  I know that, fool.
 :
 :THERSITES  Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
 :
S:
 :AJAX  Therefore I beat thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters!
 :
 :His evasions have ears thus long. I have
 :bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones.
S:I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia
 :
 :mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow.
 :
 :This lord, Achilles--Ajax, who wears his wit in his
 :
 :belly, and his guts in his head--I'll tell you what I
 :say of him.
 :
 :ACHILLES  What?
 :
 :THERSITES  I say, this Ajax--	[Ajax menaces him.]
S:
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Nay, good Ajax.
 :
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  Has not so much wit--
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES, [to Ajax]  Nay, I must hold you.
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for
 :
 :whom he comes to fight.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Peace, fool!
 :
S:THERSITES  I would have peace and quietness, but the
 :
 :fool will not--he there, that he. Look you there.
 :
 :
 :
S:AJAX  O, thou damned cur, I shall--
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Will you set your wit to a fool's?
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  No, I warrant you. The fool's will shame it.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Good words, Thersites.
 :
 :ACHILLES, [to Ajax]  What's the quarrel?
S:
 :
 :
 :AJAX  I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
 :
 :proclamation, and he rails upon me.
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  I serve thee not.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Well, go to, go to.
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  I serve here voluntary.
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  Your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not
 :
S:voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was
 :
 :here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  E'en so. A great deal of your wit, too, lies in
S:your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall
 :
 :have a great catch an he knock out either of
 :
 :your brains; he were as good crack a fusty nut with
 :
 :no kernel.
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  What, with me too, Thersites?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  There's Ulysses and old Nestor--whose wit
 :was moldy ere your grandsires had nails on
 :their toes--yoke you like draft-oxen and make
 :you plow up the wars.
 :
 :ACHILLES  What? What?
S:
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Yes, good sooth. To, Achilles! To, Ajax! To--
 :
 :
 :
S:AJAX  I shall cut out your tongue.
 :
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  'Tis no matter. I shall speak as much as
 :
 :thou afterwards.
 :
S:
 :
 :PATROCLUS  No more words, Thersites. Peace.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach
S:bids me, shall I?
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  There's for you, Patroclus.
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  I will see you hanged like clodpolls ere I
 :
 :come any more to your tents. I will keep where
 :
 :there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
 :
 :[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :PATROCLUS  A good riddance.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES, [to Ajax]
 :Marry, this, sir, is proclaimed through all our host:
 :That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
 :Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
 :Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms
 :That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare
S:
 :Maintain--I know not what; 'tis trash. Farewell.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Farewell. Who shall answer him?
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :I know not. 'Tis put to lott'ry. Otherwise,
 :He knew his man.	[Achilles and Patroclus exit.]

 :Scene 2
S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenas.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PRIAM
 :After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
 :Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
 :"Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
 :As honor, loss of time, travel, expense,
S:
 :Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
 :
 :In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
 :
S:Shall be struck off."--Hector, what say you to 't?
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
 :As far as toucheth my particular,
 :Yet, dread Priam,
 :There is no lady of more softer bowels,
 :More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
 :More ready to cry out "Who knows what follows?"
S:
 :Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,
 :
S:Surety secure; but modest doubt is called
 :
 :The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
 :
S:To th' bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.
 :
 :Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
 :
 :Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
 :
 :Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.
 :If we have lost so many tenths of ours
 :To guard a thing not ours--nor worth to us,
 :Had it our name, the value of one ten--
 :What merit's in that reason which denies
 :The yielding of her up?
S:
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Fie, fie, my brother,
 :
 :Weigh you the worth and honor of a king
 :
S:So great as our dread father's in a scale
 :
 :Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum
 :
 :The past-proportion of his infinite,
 :
 :And buckle in a waist most fathomless
 :With spans and inches so diminutive
 :As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!
 :
 :HELENUS
 :No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
S:
 :You are so empty of them. Should not our father
 :
 :Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason,
 :
 :Because your speech hath none that tell him so?
 :
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest.
 :
 :You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your
S:reasons:
 :
 :You know an enemy intends you harm;
 :
 :You know a sword employed is perilous,
 :
 :And reason flies the object of all harm.
 :Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds
 :A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
 :The very wings of reason to his heels
 :And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
 :Or like a star disorbed? Nay, if we talk of reason,
S:
 :Let's shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor
 :
 :Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their
 :
 :thoughts
 :
 :With this crammed reason. Reason and respect
 :Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
 :
S:HECTOR
 :
S:Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
 :
 :The keeping.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  What's aught but as 'tis valued?
 :
 :HECTOR
 :But value dwells not in particular will;
 :It holds his estimate and dignity
 :As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
S:
 :As in the prizer. 'Tis mad idolatry
 :
 :To make the service greater than the god;
 :
 :And the will dotes that is attributive
 :
S:To what infectiously itself affects
 :
 :Without some image of th' affected merit.
 :
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :I take today a wife, and my election
 :
 :Is led on in the conduct of my will--
 :My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
 :Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
S:Of will and judgment. How may I avoid,
 :
 :Although my will distaste what it elected,
 :
 :The wife I choose? There can be no evasion
 :
 :To blench from this and to stand firm by honor.
S:We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
 :
 :When we have soiled them, nor the remainder
 :
 :viands
 :
 :We do not throw in unrespective sieve
 :Because we now are full. It was thought meet
 :Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.
 :Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;
 :The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
 :And did him service. He touched the ports desired,
S:
 :And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
 :
S:He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and
 :
 :freshness
 :
 :Wrinkles Apollo's and makes pale the morning.
 :
 :Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
 :Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl
 :Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships
 :And turned crowned kings to merchants.
 :If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
 :As you must needs, for you all cried "Go, go"--
S:
 :If you'll confess he brought home worthy prize--
 :
S:As you must needs, for you all clapped your hands
 :
 :And cried "Inestimable"--why do you now
 :
 :The issue of your proper wisdoms rate
 :
 :And do a deed that never Fortune did,
 :Beggar the estimation which you prized
S:Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
 :
 :That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
 :
 :But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
 :
 :That in their country did them that disgrace
 :We fear to warrant in our native place.
S:
 :
 :CASSANDRA, [within]
 :
 :Cry, Trojans, cry!
 :
 :
 :PRIAM  What noise? What shriek is this?
 :
 :TROILUS
 :'Tis our mad sister. I do know her voice.

S:

 :

 :HECTOR  It is Cassandra.
 :
S:

 :
 :

 :Cry, Trojans, cry! Lend me ten thousand eyes,
S:And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

 :HECTOR  Peace, sister, peace!
 :
 :
 :CASSANDRA
 :Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled elders,
 :Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
 :Add to my clamors. Let us pay betimes
 :A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
S:
 :Cry, Trojans, cry! Practice your eyes with tears.
 :
 :Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilium stand.
 :
 :Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all.
 :
S:Cry, Trojans, cry! A Helen and a woe!
 :
 :Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.	[She exits.]
 :
 :
 :
S:HECTOR
 :
S:Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
 :
 :Of divination in our sister work
 :
 :Some touches of remorse? Or is your blood
 :
 :So madly hot that no discourse of reason
 :Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
 :Can qualify the same?
 :
 :TROILUS  Why, brother Hector,
 :We may not think the justness of each act
S:
 :Such and no other than event doth form it,
 :
 :Nor once deject the courage of our minds
 :
 :Because Cassandra's mad. Her brainsick raptures
 :
 :Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
 :Which hath our several honors all engaged
 :To make it gracious. For my private part,
 :I am no more touched than all Priam's sons;
 :And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
S:
 :Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
 :
 :To fight for and maintain!
 :
 :
 :
 :PARIS
 :Else might the world convince of levity
 :As well my undertakings as your counsels.
 :But I attest the gods, your full consent
 :Gave wings to my propension and cut off
S:
 :All fears attending on so dire a project.
 :
 :For what, alas, can these my single arms?
 :
 :What propugnation is in one man's valor
 :
 :To stand the push and enmity of those
 :This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
 :Were I alone to pass the difficulties
S:And had as ample power as I have will,
 :
 :Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
 :
 :Nor faint in the pursuit.
 :
 :
 :PRIAM  Paris, you speak
 :Like one besotted on your sweet delights.
 :You have the honey still, but these the gall.
 :So to be valiant is no praise at all.
 :
S:
 :PARIS
 :
S:Sir, I propose not merely to myself
 :
 :The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,
 :
 :But I would have the soil of her fair rape
 :
S:Wiped off in honorable keeping her.
 :
S:What treason were it to the ransacked queen,
 :
S:Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
 :
 :Now to deliver her possession up
 :
 :On terms of base compulsion? Can it be
 :
 :That so degenerate a strain as this
 :Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
 :There's not the meanest spirit on our party
S:Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
 :
 :When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
 :
 :Whose life were ill bestowed or death unfamed
 :
 :Where Helen is the subject. Then I say,
 :Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
 :The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
 :
 :HECTOR
 :Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
S:
 :And on the cause and question now in hand
 :
S:Have glozed--but superficially, not much
 :
 :Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
 :
 :Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
 :
S:The reasons you allege do more conduce
 :
 :To the hot passion of distempered blood
 :
 :Than to make up a free determination
 :
S:'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
 :
 :Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
 :
 :Of any true decision. Nature craves
 :
 :All dues be rendered to their owners. Now,
 :What nearer debt in all humanity
 :Than wife is to the husband? If this law
 :Of nature be corrupted through affection,
 :And that great minds, of partial indulgence
 :To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
S:
 :There is a law in each well-ordered nation
 :
 :To curb those raging appetites that are
 :
 :Most disobedient and refractory.
 :
S:If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta's king,
 :
 :As it is known she is, these moral laws
 :
 :Of nature and of nations speak aloud
 :
 :To have her back returned. Thus to persist
 :In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
 :But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
 :Is this in way of truth; yet, ne'ertheless,
 :My sprightly brethren, I propend to you
S:In resolution to keep Helen still,
 :
S:For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
 :
 :Upon our joint and several dignities.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :Why, there you touched the life of our design!
S:Were it not glory that we more affected
 :
 :Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
 :
 :I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
 :
 :Spent more in her defense. But, worthy Hector,
 :She is a theme of honor and renown,
 :A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
S:Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
 :
 :And fame in time to come canonize us;
 :
 :For I presume brave Hector would not lose
 :
 :So rich advantage of a promised glory
 :As smiles upon the forehead of this action
 :For the wide world's revenue.
S:
 :
 :HECTOR  I am yours,
 :
S:You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
 :
 :I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
 :
 :The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
 :
 :Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.
 :I was advertised their great general slept,
 :Whilst emulation in the army crept.
 :This, I presume, will wake him.

 :THERSITES  How now, Thersites? What, lost in the
 :
 :labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry
S:it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O, worthy
 :
 :satisfaction! Would it were otherwise, that I could
 :
 :beat him whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
 :
 :conjure and raise devils but I'll see some issue of
 :my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
 :rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine
 :it, the walls will stand till they fall of
 :themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
 :forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods;
S:
 :and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
 :
 :caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than
 :
 :little wit from them that they have, which short-armed
 :
 :ignorance itself knows is so abundant
 :scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
 :from a spider without drawing their massy irons
 :and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on
 :the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache!
S:
 :For that, methinks, is the curse depending
 :
 :on those that war for a placket. I have said my
 :
 :prayers, and devil Envy say "Amen."--What ho,
 :
 :my lord Achilles!
 :
 :PATROCLUS, [within]  Who's there? Thersites? Good
 :Thersites, come in and rail.
 :
S:
 :THERSITES  If I could 'a remembered a gilt counterfeit,
 :
 :thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation.
 :
 :But it is no matter. Thyself upon thyself! The
 :
 :common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance,
 :be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from
 :a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy
 :blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she
 :that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be
S:
 :sworn and sworn upon 't she never shrouded any
 :
 :but lazars. Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Patroclus.]
 :
 :Where's Achilles?
 :
S:PATROCLUS  What, art thou devout? Wast thou in
 :
 :prayer?
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Ay. The heavens hear me!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Amen.
 :
 :ACHILLES, [within]  Who's there?
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Thersites, my lord.
 :
S:
 :ACHILLES, [within]  Where? Where? O, where?
 :
S:
 :
 :[Enter Achilles.]
 :
 :
 :
 :[To Thersites.] Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my
 :digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my
 :table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
 :
 :THERSITES  Thy commander, Achilles.--Then, tell me,
 :Patroclus, what's Achilles?
S:
S:
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray
 :
 :thee, what's Thersites?
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Thy knower, Patroclus. Then, tell me, Patroclus,
 :what art thou?
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Thou must tell that knowest.
 :
S:
 :ACHILLES  O tell, tell.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon
 :
 :commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am
 :Patroclus' knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
 :
S:PATROCLUS  You rascal!
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Peace, fool. I have not done.
 :
 :
S:ACHILLES, [to Patroclus]  He is a privileged man.--Proceed,
 :
 :Thersites.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool,
 :Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a
 :fool.
 :
 :ACHILLES  Derive this. Come.
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command
 :
 :Achilles, Achilles is a fool to be commanded of
 :
 :Agamemnon, Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool,
 :and this Patroclus is a fool positive.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Why am I a fool?
 :
 :THERSITES  Make that demand of the creator. It suffices
S:
 :me thou art.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter at a distance Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor,
 :
S:Diomedes, Ajax, and Calchas.]
 :
 :
 :
 :Look you, who comes here?
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.--Come in
 :with me, Thersites.	[He exits.]
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Here is such patchery, such juggling, and
 :
S:such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a
 :
 :cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
 :
 :and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on
 :
 :the subject, and war and lechery confound all!
S:[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON, [to Patroclus]  Where is Achilles?
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :Within his tent, but ill-disposed, my lord.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :Let it be known to him that we are here.
S:
 :He shent our messengers, and we lay by
 :
 :Our appertainments, visiting of him.
 :
 :Let him be told so, lest perchance he think
 :
S:We dare not move the question of our place
 :
 :Or know not what we are.
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  I shall say so to him.	[He exits.]
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :We saw him at the opening of his tent.
 :He is not sick.
S:
 :
 :AJAX  Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call
 :
 :it melancholy if you will favor the man, but, by my
 :
 :head, 'tis pride. But, why, why? Let him show us a
S:cause.--A word, my lord.
 :
 :[He and Agamemnon walk aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
 :
 :ULYSSES  Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
 :
 :NESTOR  Who, Thersites?
 :
S:
 :ULYSSES  He.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his
 :
S:argument.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  No. You see, he is his argument that has his
 :
 :argument: Achilles.
S:
 :
 :NESTOR  All the better. Their fraction is more our wish
 :
 :than their faction. But it was a strong composure a
 :
 :fool could disunite.
S:
 :
 :ULYSSES  The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may
 :
 :easily untie.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Patroclus.]
 :
 :Here comes Patroclus.
 :
 :NESTOR  No Achilles with him.
S:
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy;
 :
 :his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS, [to Agamemnon]
 :Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
 :If anything more than your sport and pleasure
S:Did move your greatness and this noble state
 :
 :To call upon him. He hopes it is no other
 :
 :But for your health and your digestion sake,
 :
 :An after-dinner's breath.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Hear you, Patroclus:
 :We are too well acquainted with these answers,
 :But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn,
 :Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
S:
 :Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
 :
 :Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,
 :
 :Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
 :
 :Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
 :Yea, and like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
 :Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him
 :We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin
 :If you do say we think him overproud
S:
 :And underhonest, in self-assumption greater
 :
 :Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than
 :
 :himself
 :
S:Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
 :
 :Disguise the holy strength of their command,
 :
 :And underwrite in an observing kind
 :
 :His humorous predominance--yea, watch
 :His course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if
S:The passage and whole carriage of this action
 :
 :Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add
 :
 :That, if he overhold his price so much,
 :
 :We'll none of him. But let him, like an engine
 :Not portable, lie under this report:
S:"Bring action hither; this cannot go to war."
 :
 :A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
 :
 :Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :I shall, and bring his answer presently.
S:
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
 :
 :We come to speak with him.--Ulysses, enter you.
 :[Ulysses exits, with Patroclus.]
 :
 :AJAX  What is he more than another?
 :
S:AGAMEMNON  No more than what he thinks he is.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself
 :
 :a better man than I am?
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  No question.
 :
 :AJAX  Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?
S:
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as
 :
 :valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle,
 :
 :and altogether more tractable.
 :
 :AJAX  Why should a man be proud? How doth pride
 :grow? I know not what pride is.
 :
S:AGAMEMNON  Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your
 :
 :virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself.
 :
 :Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own
 :
 :chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the
S:deed devours the deed in the praise.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering
 :
 :of toads.
 :
 :NESTOR, [aside]
 :And yet he loves himself. Is 't not strange?
S:
 :
 :[Enter Ulysses.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.
 :
 :
 :
S:AGAMEMNON
 :
 :What's his excuse?
 :
S:
 :
S:ULYSSES  He doth rely on none,
 :
 :But carries on the stream of his dispose,
 :
 :Without observance or respect of any,
 :
 :In will peculiar and in self-admission.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :Why, will he not, upon our fair request,
S:Untent his person and share th' air with us?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
S:He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness
 :
 :And speaks not to himself but with a pride
 :
 :That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth
 :
 :Holds in his blood such swoll'n and hot discourse
 :That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
 :Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages
 :And batters down himself. What should I say?
S:He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
 :
 :Cry "No recovery."
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Let Ajax go to him.--
 :Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.
 :'Tis said he holds you well and will be led
 :At your request a little from himself.
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:
S:O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
 :
 :We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
 :
S:When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord
 :
 :That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
 :
S:And never suffers matter of the world
 :
 :Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve
 :
 :And ruminate himself--shall he be worshipped
 :
 :Of that we hold an idol more than he?
 :No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord
 :Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,
 :Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
 :As amply titled as Achilles is,
S:By going to Achilles.
 :
S:That were to enlard his fat-already pride
 :
 :And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
 :
 :With entertaining great Hyperion.
 :
 :This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid
 :And say in thunder "Achilles, go to him."
 :
 :NESTOR, [aside to Diomedes]
 :O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.
 :
S:
S:DIOMEDES, [aside to Nestor]
 :
 :And how his silence drinks up this applause!
 :
S:
 :
 :AJAX
 :
 :If I go to him, with my armed fist
 :
S:I'll pash him o'er the face.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  O, no, you shall not go.
 :
 :
 :AJAX
S:An he be proud with me, I'll feeze his pride.
 :
 :Let me go to him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  A paltry, insolent fellow.
 :
 :
 :NESTOR, [aside]  How he describes himself!
 :
S:AJAX  Can he not be sociable?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside]  The raven chides blackness.
 :
 :
 :AJAX  I'll let his humorous blood.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON, [aside]  He will be the physician that
 :should be the patient.
 :
S:
 :AJAX  An all men were of my mind--
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside]  Wit would be out of fashion.
 :
 :
 :AJAX  --he should not bear it so; he should eat swords
S:first. Shall pride carry it?
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR, [aside]  An 'twould, you'd carry half.
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside]  He would have ten shares.
 :
 :AJAX  I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
 :
 :NESTOR, [aside]  He's not yet through warm. Force him
S:
 :with praises. Pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [to Agamemnon]
 :
S:My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR, [to Agamemnon]
 :
 :Our noble general, do not do so.
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES, [to Agamemnon]
 :
 :You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
 :Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
S:I will be silent.
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  Wherefore should you so?
 :
 :He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Know the whole world, he is as valiant--
 :
 :AJAX  A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!
S:
 :Would he were a Trojan!
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  What a vice were it in Ajax now--
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  If he were proud--
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Or covetous of praise--
 :
S:
S:ULYSSES  Ay, or surly borne--
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Or strange, or self-affected--
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [to Ajax]
 :Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet
S:composure.
 :
 :Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;
 :
 :Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
 :
 :Thrice famed beyond, beyond thy erudition;
 :But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,
 :Let Mars divide eternity in twain
 :And give him half; and for thy vigor,
 :Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
 :To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
S:
 :Which like a bourn, a pale, a shore confines
 :
S:Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here's Nestor,
 :
 :Instructed by the antiquary times;
 :
 :He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.--
 :
 :But pardon, father Nestor, were your days
 :As green as Ajax' and your brain so tempered,
S:You should not have the eminence of him,
 :
 :But be as Ajax.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Shall I call you father?
 :
 :NESTOR
 :Ay, my good son.
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
S:
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES
 :
S:There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
 :
 :Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
 :
 :To call together all his state of war.
 :
 :Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow
 :We must with all our main of power stand fast.
 :And here's a lord--come knights from east to west
 :And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
S:
 :Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.
 :
 :Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.

 :=======
 :
S:[Music sounds within. Enter Pandarus and Paris's
 :
 :Servingman.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Friend, you, pray you, a word. Do you not
 :follow the young Lord Paris?
 :
 :MAN  Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
 :
S:
S:PANDARUS  You depend upon him, I mean.
 :
 :
 :
 :MAN  Sir, I do depend upon the Lord.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  You depend upon a notable gentleman. I
 :must needs praise him.
S:
 :
 :MAN  The Lord be praised!
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  You know me, do you not?
 :
 :MAN  Faith, sir, superficially.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Friend, know me better. I am the Lord
 :Pandarus.
S:
 :
 :
 :MAN  I hope I shall know your Honor better.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I do desire it.
 :
 :MAN  You are in the state of grace?
 :
S:PANDARUS  Grace? Not so, friend. "Honor" and "Lordship"
 :
 :are my titles. What music is this?
 :
S:
 :
 :MAN  I do but partly know, sir. It is music in parts.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Know you the musicians?
 :
 :MAN  Wholly, sir.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Who play they to?
 :
S:
 :MAN  To the hearers, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  At whose pleasure, friend?
 :
S:
 :
 :MAN  At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Command, I mean, friend.
 :
 :MAN  Who shall I command, sir?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Friend, we understand not one another. I
 :am too courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose
S:
S:request do these men play?
 :
 :
 :
 :MAN  That's to 't indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of
 :
 :
 :Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the
 :mortal Venus, the heart blood of beauty, love's visible
 :soul.
S:
 :
S:PANDARUS  Who, my cousin Cressida?
 :
 :
 :
 :MAN  No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her
 :
 :attributes?
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not
 :
 :seen the Lady Cressid. I come to speak with Paris
 :
 :from the Prince Troilus. I will make a complimental
 :assault upon him, for my business seethes.
 :
 :MAN  Sodden business! There's a stewed phrase indeed.
 :
 :[Enter Paris and Helen with Attendants.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
 :
 :company! Fair desires in all fair measure fairly
 :guide them!--Especially to you, fair queen, fair
 :thoughts be your fair pillow!
S:
 :
S:HELEN  Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  You speak your fair pleasure, sweet
 :
 :queen.--Fair prince, here is good broken music.
S:
 :
 :PARIS  You have broke it, cousin, and, by my life, you
 :
 :shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
 :
 :with a piece of your performance.
 :
 :HELEN  He is full of harmony.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Truly, lady, no.
S:
 :
 :HELEN  O, sir--
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
 :
 :PARIS  Well said, my lord; well, you say so in fits.
 :
 :PANDARUS  I have business to my lord, dear queen.--
 :My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?
S:
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you
 :
 :sing, certainly.
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Well, sweet queen, you are pleasant with
 :
 :me.--But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and
 :
 :most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus--
S:
 :
 :HELEN  My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord--
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Go to, sweet queen, go to--commends himself
 :most affectionately to you--
 :
 :HELEN  You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you
 :do, our melancholy upon your head!
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Sweet queen, sweet queen, that's a sweet
 :
S:queen, i' faith--
 :
 :
 :
S:HELEN  And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Nay, that shall not serve your turn, that
 :
 :shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such
 :words, no, no.--And, my lord, he desires you that
 :if the King call for him at supper, you will make his
 :excuse.
 :
 :HELEN  My Lord Pandarus--
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  What says my sweet queen, my very, very
 :
 :sweet queen?
 :
 :
 :PARIS  What exploit's in hand? Where sups he tonight?
S:
 :
 :HELEN  Nay, but, my lord--
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  What says my sweet queen? My cousin will
 :fall out with you.
 :
S:HELEN, [to Paris]  You must not know where he sups.
 :
 :
 :
 :PARIS  I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  No, no, no such matter; you are wide.
 :Come, your disposer is sick.
 :
 :PARIS  Well, I'll make 's excuse.
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?
 :
 :No, your poor disposer's sick.
 :
 :
 :
 :PARIS  I spy.
 :
 :PANDARUS  You spy? What do you spy?--Come, give me
 :an instrument. [An Attendant gives him an instrument.]
S:Now, sweet queen.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Why, this is kindly done.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  My niece is horribly in love with a thing you
 :have, sweet queen.
 :
 :HELEN  She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord
S:Paris.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  He? No, she'll none of him. They two are
 :
 :twain.
 :
 :HELEN  Falling in after falling out may make them
 :three.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Come, come, I'll hear no more of this. I'll
S:
S:sing you a song now.
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN  Ay, ay, prithee. Now, by my troth, sweet lord,
 :
 :thou hast a fine forehead.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Ay, you may, you may.
S:
 :
 :HELEN  Let thy song be love. "This love will undo us all."
 :
 :O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Love? Ay, that it shall, i' faith.
 :
 :PARIS  Ay, good now, "Love, love, nothing but love."
 :
 :PANDARUS  In good troth, it begins so.
S:
S:Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
 :
S:For, O, love's bow
 :
 :Shoots buck and doe.
 :
 :The shaft confounds
 :
 :Not that it wounds
 :But tickles still the sore.
S:
 :
 :These lovers cry "O ho!" they die,
 :
 :Yet that which seems the wound to kill
 :
 :Doth turn "O ho!" to "Ha ha he!"
 :So dying love lives still.
 :"O ho!" awhile, but "Ha ha ha!"
S:"O ho!"groans out for "ha ha ha!"--Hey ho!
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
 :
 :
 :PARIS  He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds
 :hot blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and
S:hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Is this the generation of love? Hot blood,
 :
 :hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers.
 :Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
 :afield today?
 :
 :PARIS  Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
S:gallantry of Troy. I would fain have armed today,
 :
 :but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
 :
 :brother Troilus went not?
 :
S:
 :
 :HELEN  He hangs the lip at something.--You know all,
 :
 :Lord Pandarus.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Not I, honey sweet queen. I long to hear how
 :they sped today.--You'll remember your brother's
 :excuse?
 :
 :PARIS  To a hair.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Farewell, sweet queen.
 :
 :
 :
 :HELEN  Commend me to your niece.
 :
 :PANDARUS  I will, sweet queen.	[He exits.]
 :[Sound a retreat.]
 :
S:
S:PARIS
 :
 :They're come from the field. Let us to Priam's hall
 :
 :To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
 :
 :To help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,
 :With these your white enchanting fingers touched,
S:Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
 :

S:'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris.
 :
 :Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
 :
 :Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,

 :Scene 2
 :=======
S:[Enter Pandarus and Troilus's Man, meeting.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  How now? Where's thy master? At my
 :
 :cousin Cressida's?
 :
S:
 :
S:MAN  No, sir, he stays for you to conduct him thither.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Troilus.]
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  O, here he comes.--How now, how now?
 :
 :TROILUS, [to his Man]  Sirrah, walk off.	[Man exits.]
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  Have you seen my cousin?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :No, Pandarus. I stalk about her door
 :Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
S:Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
 :
 :And give me swift transportance to those fields
 :
S:Where I may wallow in the lily beds
 :
 :Proposed for the deserver! O, gentle Pandar,
 :
S:From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
 :
 :And fly with me to Cressid!
 :
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Walk here i' th' orchard. I'll bring her
 :
 :straight.
 :
 :[Pandarus exits.]
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
 :
 :Th' imaginary relish is so sweet
 :That it enchants my sense. What will it be
S:When that the wat'ry palate taste indeed
 :
 :Love's thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me,
 :
 :Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
 :
S:Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness
 :
 :For the capacity of my ruder powers.
 :
 :I fear it much; and I do fear besides
 :
 :That I shall lose distinction in my joys,
 :As doth a battle when they charge on heaps
 :The enemy flying.
 :
 :[Enter Pandarus.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  She's making her ready; she'll come straight.
 :
 :You must be witty now. She does so blush and
 :
 :fetches her wind so short as if she were frayed with
S:a spirit. I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain. She
 :
 :fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en sparrow.
 :
 :[Pandarus exits.]
 :
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom.
 :
 :My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,
 :
S:And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
 :
 :Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring
 :
 :The eye of majesty.
 :
 :
S:[Enter Pandarus, and Cressida veiled.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS, [to Cressida]  Come, come, what need you
 :blush? Shame's a baby.--Here she is now. Swear
 :the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.
 :[Cressida offers to leave.] What, are you gone again?
 :You must be watched ere you be made tame, must
S:you? Come your ways; come your ways. An you
 :
 :draw backward, we'll put you i' th' thills.--Why
 :
 :do you not speak to her?--Come, draw this curtain
 :
 :and let's see your picture. [He draws back her veil.]
 :Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!
 :An 'twere dark, you'd close sooner.--So, so, rub on,
 :and kiss the mistress. [(They kiss.)] How now? A
 :kiss in fee-farm? Build there, carpenter; the air is
S:sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I
 :
 :part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks
 :
 :i' th' river. Go to, go to.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  You have bereft me of all words, lady.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Words pay no debts; give her deeds. But
 :she'll bereave you o' th' deeds too, if she call your
S:activity in question. [(They kiss.)] What, billing
 :
 :again? Here's "In witness whereof the parties
 :
 :interchangeably--." Come in, come in. I'll go get a fire.
 :
 :[Pandarus exits.]
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Will you walk in, my lord?
 :
 :TROILUS  O Cressid, how often have I wished me thus!
 :
S:
 :CRESSIDA  "Wished," my lord? The gods grant--O, my
 :
 :lord!
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  What should they grant? What makes this
 :pretty abruption? What too-curious dreg espies
S:my sweet lady in the fountain of our love?
 :
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Fears make devils of cherubins; they never
 :
 :see truly.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds
 :
 :safer footing than blind reason, stumbling without
 :
 :fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.
 :
S:
 :
S:TROILUS  O, let my lady apprehend no fear. In all
 :
 :Cupid's pageant there is presented no monster.
 :
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Nor nothing monstrous neither?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Nothing but our undertakings, when we vow
 :
 :to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers,
S:thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
 :
 :enough than for us to undergo any difficulty
 :
S:imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that
 :
S:the will is infinite and the execution confined, that
 :
 :the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  They say all lovers swear more performance
 :than they are able and yet reserve an ability that
S:they never perform, vowing more than the perfection
 :
 :of ten and discharging less than the tenth part
 :
 :of one. They that have the voice of lions and the
 :
 :act of hares, are they not monsters?
 :
 :TROILUS  Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as
 :we are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall
 :go bare till merit crown it. No perfection in reversion
 :shall have a praise in present. We will not
S:
S:name desert before his birth, and, being born, his
 :
 :addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith.
 :
 :Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can
 :
S:say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what
 :
 :truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Will you walk in, my lord?
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Pandarus.]
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  What, blushing still? Have you not done
 :talking yet?
 :
S:
 :CRESSIDA  Well, uncle, what folly I commit I dedicate
 :
S:to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  I thank you for that. If my lord get a boy of
 :
 :you, you'll give him me. Be true to my lord. If he
 :flinch, chide me for it.
 :
 :TROILUS, [to Cressida]  You know now your hostages:
 :your uncle's word and my firm faith.
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  Nay, I'll give my word for her too. Our kindred,
 :
 :though they be long ere they be wooed, they
 :
 :are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell
 :
 :you; they'll stick where they are thrown.
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
S:Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.
 :
 :Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
 :
 :For many weary months.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
S:Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,
 :With the first glance that ever--pardon me;
 :If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
 :I love you now, but till now not so much
S:But I might master it. In faith, I lie;
 :
 :My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
 :
 :Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
 :
 :Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us
 :When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
 :But though I loved you well, I wooed you not;
 :And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man;
 :Or that we women had men's privilege
 :Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
S:
 :For in this rapture I shall surely speak
 :
 :The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
 :
 :Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
 :
 :My very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth.
S:
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
 :
 :[They kiss.]
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Pretty, i' faith!
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA, [to Troilus]
S:My lord, I do beseech you pardon me.
 :
 :'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
 :
S:I am ashamed. O heavens, what have I done!
 :
 :For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Your leave, sweet Cressid?
 :
 :PANDARUS  Leave? An you take leave till tomorrow
S:morning--
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Pray you, content you.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  What offends you, lady?
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Sir, mine own company.
 :
 :TROILUS  You cannot shun yourself.
S:
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Let me go and try.
 :
 :I have a kind of self resides with you,
 :
 :But an unkind self that itself will leave
S:To be another's fool. I would be gone.
 :
 :Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
 :
 :
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love
 :And fell so roundly to a large confession
 :To angle for your thoughts. But you are wise,
 :Or else you love not; for to be wise and love
S:Exceeds man's might. That dwells with gods above.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :O, that I thought it could be in a woman--
 :As, if it can, I will presume in you--
 :To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love,
 :To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
 :Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
 :That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
S:
 :Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
 :
S:That my integrity and truth to you
 :
 :Might be affronted with the match and weight
 :
 :Of such a winnowed purity in love;
 :
 :How were I then uplifted! But, alas,
 :I am as true as truth's simplicity
S:And simpler than the infancy of truth.
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :In that I'll war with you.
 :
 :
S:TROILUS  O virtuous fight,
 :
 :When right with right wars who shall be most right!
 :
S:True swains in love shall in the world to come
 :
 :Approve their truth by Troilus. When their rhymes,
 :
S:Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
 :
 :Wants similes, truth tired with iteration--
 :
 :"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
 :
 :As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
S:As iron to adamant, as Earth to th' center"--
 :
 :Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
 :
S:As truth's authentic author to be cited,
 :
 :"As true as Troilus" shall crown up the verse
 :
 :And sanctify the numbers.
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Prophet may you be!
 :
 :If I be false or swerve a hair from truth,
 :
 :When time is old and hath forgot itself,
 :
 :When water drops have worn the stones of Troy
 :And blind oblivion swallowed cities up,
 :And mighty states characterless are grated
 :To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
 :From false to false, among false maids in love,
 :Upbraid my falsehood! When they've said "as false
S:
 :As air, as water, wind or sandy earth,
 :
 :As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer's calf,
 :
 :Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,"
 :
 :Yea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
 :"As false as Cressid."
S:
 :
 :PANDARUS  Go to, a bargain made. Seal it, seal it. I'll be
 :
 :the witness. Here I hold your hand, here my
 :
 :cousin's. If ever you prove false one to another, since
S:I have taken such pains to bring you together, let
 :
 :all pitiful goers-between be called to the world's
 :
 :end after my name: call them all panders. Let all
 :
 :constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
S:and all brokers-between panders. Say "Amen."
 :
 :
 :
S:TROILUS  Amen.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Amen.
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber
 :with a bed, which bed, because it shall not
 :speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death.
 :Away.	[Troilus and Cressida exit.]
 :And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
S:
 :Bed, chamber, pander to provide this gear.
 :
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 3
 :=======
S:[Flourish. Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor,
 :
 :Agamemnon, Calchas, Menelaus, and Ajax.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:CALCHAS
 :
 :Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
 :
 :Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud
 :
 :To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
S:That, through the sight I bear in things to come,
 :
 :I have abandoned Troy, left my possessions,
 :
 :Incurred a traitor's name, exposed myself,
 :
 :From certain and possessed conveniences,
 :To doubtful fortunes, sequest'ring from me all
S:That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition
 :
 :Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
 :
 :And here, to do you service, am become
 :
S:As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.
 :
 :I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
 :
 :To give me now a little benefit
 :
 :Out of those many regist'red in promise,
 :Which you say live to come in my behalf.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :What wouldst thou of us, Trojan, make demand?
 :
S:
 :CALCHAS
 :
 :You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor
 :
 :Yesterday took. Troy holds him very dear.
 :
 :Oft have you--often have you thanks therefor--
 :Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
 :Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,
 :I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
 :That their negotiations all must slack,
S:
 :Wanting his manage; and they will almost
 :
 :Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
 :
 :In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,
 :
 :And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
 :Shall quite strike off all service I have done
S:In most accepted pain.
 :
 :
 :
S:AGAMEMNON  Let Diomedes bear him,
 :
 :And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have
 :
 :What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
 :
 :Furnish you fairly for this interchange.
 :Withal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow
 :Be answered in his challenge. Ajax is ready.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden
 :
 :Which I am proud to bear.	[He exits with Calchas.]
 :
S:
 :
 :[Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent.
 :Please it our General pass strangely by him
 :As if he were forgot, and, princes all,
 :Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.
 :I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
S:
 :Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on
 :
S:him.
 :
 :If so, I have derision medicinable
 :
 :To use between your strangeness and his pride,
 :
S:Which his own will shall have desire to drink.
 :
 :It may do good; pride hath no other glass
 :
 :To show itself but pride, for supple knees
 :
 :Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :We'll execute your purpose and put on
 :A form of strangeness as we pass along;
 :So do each lord, and either greet him not
S:
 :Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
 :
 :Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.
 :
 :
 :
 :[They pass before Achilles and Patroclus. Ulysses
S:remains in place, reading.]
 :
 :
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :What, comes the General to speak with me?
 :You know my mind: I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON, [to Nestor]
 :What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?
 :
S:
 :NESTOR, [to Achilles]
 :
S:Would you, my lord, aught with the General?
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  No.
 :
 :
 :NESTOR  Nothing, my lord.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  The better.	[Agamemnon and Nestor exit.]
 :
 :ACHILLES, [to Menelaus]  Good day, good day.
S:
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS  How do you? How do you?	[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  What, does the cuckold scorn me?
 :
 :AJAX  How now, Patroclus?
 :
 :ACHILLES  Good morrow, Ajax.
S:
 :
 :
S:AJAX  Ha?
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Good morrow.
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Ay, and good next day too.	[He exits.]
 :
S:ACHILLES
 :
S:What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :
 :They pass by strangely. They were used to bend,
 :To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
 :To come as humbly as they use to creep
 :To holy altars.
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  What, am I poor of late?
 :
 :'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with Fortune,
 :
 :Must fall out with men too. What the declined is
 :He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
 :As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,
 :Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
 :And not a man, for being simply man,
 :Hath any honor, but honor for those honors
S:
 :That are without him--as place, riches, and favor,
 :
 :Prizes of accident as oft as merit,
 :
 :Which, when they fall, as being slippery slanders,
 :
 :The love that leaned on them, as slippery too,
 :Doth one pluck down another and together
 :Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me.
 :Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy,
 :At ample point, all that I did possess,
S:
 :Save these men's looks, who do, methinks, find out
 :
 :Something not worth in me such rich beholding
 :
 :As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.
 :
 :I'll interrupt his reading.--How now, Ulysses?
 :
S:ULYSSES  Now, great Thetis' son--
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  What are you reading?
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  A strange fellow here
 :Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,
 :How much in having, or without or in,
 :Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
 :Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
S:
S:As when his virtues, shining upon others,
 :
S:Heat them, and they retort that heat again
 :
 :To the first giver.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  This is not strange, Ulysses.
S:The beauty that is borne here in the face
 :
 :The bearer knows not, but commends itself
 :
 :To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
 :
 :That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
S:Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed
 :
 :Salutes each other with each other's form.
 :
 :For speculation turns not to itself
 :
 :Till it hath traveled and is mirrored there
S:Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :I do not strain at the position--
S:It is familiar--but at the author's drift,
 :
 :Who in his circumstance expressly proves
 :
 :That no man is the lord of anything--
 :
 :Though in and of him there be much consisting--
S:Till he communicate his parts to others;
 :
 :Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
 :
 :Till he behold them formed in the applause
 :
 :Where they're extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate
 :The voice again or, like a gate of steel
 :Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
S:His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this
 :
 :And apprehended here immediately
 :
 :Th' unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!
 :
 :A very horse, that has he knows not what!
 :Nature, what things there are
S:Most abject in regard, and dear in use,
 :
S:What things again most dear in the esteem
 :
 :And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow--
 :
 :An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
 :
 :Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do
 :While some men leave to do!
 :How some men creep in skittish Fortune's hall,
 :Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
 :How one man eats into another's pride,
S:While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
 :
 :To see these Grecian lords--why, even already
 :
 :They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
 :
 :As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
S:And great Troy shrieking.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :I do believe it, for they passed by me
S:As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
 :
 :Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back
 :Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
 :A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.
 :Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured
S:As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
 :
 :As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,
 :
 :Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang
 :
 :Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
 :In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way,
 :For honor travels in a strait so narrow
 :Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,
 :For Emulation hath a thousand sons
 :That one by one pursue. If you give way
S:
 :Or turn aside from the direct forthright,
 :
 :Like to an entered tide they all rush by
 :
 :And leave you hindmost;
 :
S:Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
 :
 :Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
 :
 :O'errun and trampled on. Then what they do in
 :
S:present,
 :
 :Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
 :
 :For Time is like a fashionable host
 :
 :That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand
 :And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,
 :Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,
 :And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek
 :Remuneration for the thing it was,
 :For beauty, wit,
S:
 :High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,
 :
 :Love, friendship, charity are subjects all
 :
 :To envious and calumniating Time.
 :
 :One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
 :That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,
 :Though they are made and molded of things past,
 :And give to dust that is a little gilt
 :More laud than gilt o'erdusted.
S:
S:The present eye praises the present object.
 :
 :Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
 :
 :That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,
 :
 :Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
S:Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,
 :
 :And still it might, and yet it may again,
 :
 :If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
 :
 :And case thy reputation in thy tent,
 :Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
 :Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
S:And drave great Mars to faction.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Of this my privacy,
 :
S:I have strong reasons.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  But 'gainst your privacy
 :
 :The reasons are more potent and heroical.
 :'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
 :With one of Priam's daughters.
S:
 :
S:ACHILLES  Ha? Known?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  Is that a wonder?
 :
 :The providence that's in a watchful state
 :Knows almost every grain of Pluto's gold,
 :Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep,
 :Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
 :Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
 :There is a mystery--with whom relation
S:
 :Durst never meddle--in the soul of state,
 :
 :Which hath an operation more divine
 :
 :Than breath or pen can give expressure to.
 :
 :All the commerce that you have had with Troy
 :As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
S:And better would it fit Achilles much
 :
 :To throw down Hector than Polyxena.
 :
S:But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
 :
 :When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
 :
 :And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
 :
 :"Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
 :But our great Ajax bravely beat down him."
S:Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.
 :
 :The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
 :
 :[He exits.]
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you.
 :A woman impudent and mannish grown
 :Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
 :In time of action. I stand condemned for this.
S:
 :They think my little stomach to the war,
 :
 :And your great love to me, restrains you thus.
 :
 :Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid
 :
 :Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
 :And, like a dewdrop from the lion's mane,
S:Be shook to air.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
S:Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :I see my reputation is at stake;
 :My fame is shrewdly gored.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  O, then, beware!
 :Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.
 :Omission to do what is necessary
S:
 :Seals a commission to a blank of danger,
 :
 :And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
 :
 :Even then when they sit idly in the sun.
 :
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
 :
 :I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
 :T' invite the Trojan lords after the combat
 :To see us here unarmed. I have a woman's longing,
 :An appetite that I am sick withal,
 :To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
 :To talk with him, and to behold his visage,
S:
 :Even to my full of view.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Thersites.]
 :
S:
 :
 :A labor saved.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  A wonder!
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  What?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for
 :himself.
 :
 :ACHILLES  How so?
 :
 :THERSITES  He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector
S:
S:and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling
 :
S:that he raves in saying nothing.
 :
 :
 :
S:ACHILLES  How can that be?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock--
 :
 :a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess
 :that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set
 :down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard,
 :as who should say "There were wit in this
 :head an 'twould out"--and so there is, but it lies
 :as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not
S:
 :show without knocking. The man's undone forever,
 :
 :for if Hector break not his neck i' th' combat,
 :
 :he'll break 't himself in vainglory. He knows not
 :
 :me. I said "Good morrow, Ajax," and he replies
 :"Thanks, Agamemnon." What think you of this
 :man that takes me for the General? He's grown a
 :very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of
 :opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a
S:
 :leather jerkin.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Thou must be my ambassador to him,
 :
 :Thersites.
 :
 :THERSITES  Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody. He professes
 :not answering; speaking is for beggars; he
S:wears his tongue in 's arms. I will put on his presence.
 :
 :Let Patroclus make his demands to me. You
 :
 :shall see the pageant of Ajax.
 :
 :
S:ACHILLES  To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire
 :
 :the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
 :
 :to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct
 :
 :for his person of the magnanimous and
 :most illustrious, six-or-seven-times-honored captain
 :general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
 :et cetera. Do this.
 :
S:PATROCLUS, [to Thersites, who is playing Ajax]  Jove
 :
 :bless great Ajax.
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Hum!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  I come from the worthy Achilles--
 :
 :THERSITES  Ha?
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Who most humbly desires you to invite
 :Hector to his tent--
S:
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Hum!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  And to procure safe-conduct from
 :Agamemnon.
 :
S:THERSITES  Agamemnon?
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Ay, my lord.
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Ha!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  What say you to 't?
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
 :
 :
 :
S:PATROCLUS  Your answer, sir.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the
 :
 :clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he
 :shall pay for me ere he has me.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Your answer, sir.
 :
 :THERSITES  Fare you well with all my heart.
S:
 :[He pretends to exit.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ACHILLES  Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  No, but he's out of tune thus. What music
 :
 :will be in him when Hector has knocked out his
 :brains I know not. But I am sure none, unless the
 :fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.
 :
S:ACHILLES  Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him
 :
 :straight.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Let me bear another to his horse, for that's
 :the more capable creature.
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirred,
 :And I myself see not the bottom of it.
S:
S:[Achilles and Patroclus exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  Would the fountain of your mind were clear
 :
 :again, that I might water an ass at it. I had rather
 :
 :be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

 :=======
 :[Enter at one door Aeneas with a Torchbearer, at

S:
 :Grecians with torches.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :PARIS  See, ho! Who is that there?
 :
 :DEIPHOBUS  It is the Lord Aeneas.
 :
 :AENEAS  Is the Prince there in person?--
S:
 :Had I so good occasion to lie long
 :
S:As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
 :
 :Should rob my bedmate of my company.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:That's my mind too.--Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.
 :
 :
 :
S:PARIS
 :
 :A valiant Greek, Aeneas; take his hand.
 :
 :Witness the process of your speech, wherein
 :
 :You told how Diomed a whole week by days
S:Did haunt you in the field.
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  Health to you, valiant sir,
 :
 :During all question of the gentle truce;
 :But when I meet you armed, as black defiance
 :As heart can think or courage execute.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:The one and other Diomed embraces.
 :
 :Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health;
 :
 :But when contention and occasion meet,
 :
S:By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
 :
S:With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
 :
S:
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
 :
 :With his face backward. In human gentleness,
 :Welcome to Troy. Now, by Anchises' life,
 :Welcome indeed. By Venus' hand I swear
 :No man alive can love in such a sort
S:The thing he means to kill more excellently.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :We sympathize. Jove, let Aeneas live,
S:If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
 :
 :A thousand complete courses of the sun!
 :
 :But in mine emulous honor let him die
 :
 :With every joint a wound and that tomorrow.
 :
 :AENEAS  We know each other well.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:We do, and long to know each other worse.
 :
 :
 :
 :PARIS
 :
 :This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
 :The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
 :[To Aeneas.] What business, lord, so early?
 :
 :AENEAS
 :I was sent for to the King, but why I know not.
S:
 :
 :
 :PARIS
 :
 :His purpose meets you. 'Twas to bring this Greek
 :
S:To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
 :
 :For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.
 :
 :Let's have your company, or, if you please,
 :
 :Haste there before us. [(Aside to Aeneas.)] I constantly
 :believe--
 :Or, rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
 :My brother Troilus lodges there tonight.
 :Rouse him, and give him note of our approach,
 :With the whole quality whereof. I fear
S:
 :We shall be much unwelcome.
 :
S:
 :
 :AENEAS, [aside to Paris]  That I assure you.
 :
S:Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
 :
 :Than Cressid borne from Troy.
 :
 :
 :
S:PARIS, [aside to Aeneas]  There is no help.
 :
S:The bitter disposition of the time
 :
 :Will have it so.--On, lord, we'll follow you.
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  Good morrow, all.
S:[Aeneas exits with the Torchbearer.]
 :
S:
 :
 :PARIS
 :
 :And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
 :
 :Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
 :Who, in your thoughts, deserves fair Helen best,
 :Myself or Menelaus?
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Both alike.
 :He merits well to have her that doth seek her,
S:
S:Not making any scruple of her soilure,
 :
 :With such a hell of pain and world of charge;
 :
S:And you as well to keep her that defend her,
 :
 :Not palating the taste of her dishonor,
 :
 :With such a costly loss of wealth and friends.
 :
 :He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
S:The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
 :
 :You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
 :
 :Are pleased to breed out your inheritors.
 :
 :Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
 :But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
 :
 :PARIS
 :You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
 :
S:
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :She's bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:
 :
 :For every false drop in her bawdy veins
 :
 :A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
 :Of her contaminated carrion weight
 :A Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,
 :She hath not given so many good words breath
 :As for her Greeks and Trojans suffered death.
S:
 :
 :
 :PARIS
 :
 :Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
 :
S:Dispraise the thing that they desire to buy.
 :
 :But we in silence hold this virtue well:
 :
 :We'll not commend that not intend to sell.
 :
 :Here lies our way.

S:

 :
 :Dear, trouble not yourself. The morn is cold.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down.
 :He shall unbolt the gates.
 :
S:TROILUS  Trouble him not.
 :
S:To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes

 :And give as soft attachment to thy senses
 :

 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
S:Good morrow, then.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  I prithee now, to bed.
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Are you aweary of me?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :O Cressida! But that the busy day,
 :Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
 :And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
 :I would not from thee.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Night hath been too brief.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
S:Beshrew the witch! With venomous wights she stays
 :
 :As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
 :
 :With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
 :
 :You will catch cold and curse me.
 :
S:CRESSIDA
 :
 :Prithee, tarry. You men will never tarry.
 :
 :O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
 :
 :And then you would have tarried. Hark, there's one up.
 :
 :PANDARUS, [within]  What's all the doors open here?
 :
 :TROILUS  It is your uncle.
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.
 :
S:I shall have such a life!
 :

 :PANDARUS  How now, how now? How go maidenheads?
 :Here, you maid! Where's my Cousin Cressid?
 :
 :CRESSIDA
S:
 :Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.
 :
 :You bring me to do--and then you flout me too.
 :
 :
 :
S:PANDARUS  To do what, to do what?--Let her say
 :
S:what.--What have I brought you to do?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :Come, come, beshrew your heart! You'll ne'er be good
 :Nor suffer others.
 :
 :PANDARUS  Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia!
 :Has 't not slept tonight? Would he not--a
 :naughty man--let it sleep? A bugbear take him!
S:
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA, [to Troilus]
 :
 :Did not I tell you? Would he were knocked i' th' head!
 :
S:[One knocks.]
 :
 :Who's that at door?--Good uncle, go and see.--
 :
 :My lord, come you again into my chamber.
 :
 :You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
 :
 :TROILUS  Ha, ha!
 :
 :CRESSIDA
S:Come, you are deceived. I think of no such thing.
 :
 :[Knock.]
 :
 :How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in.
 :
 :I would not for half Troy have you seen here.

S:
 :
 :AENEAS  Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Who's there? My Lord Aeneas? By my troth,
S:I knew you not. What news with you so early?
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  Is not Prince Troilus here?
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Here? What should he do here?
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Come, he is here, my lord. Do not deny him.
 :It doth import him much to speak with me.
S:
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Is he here, say you? It's more than I know,
 :
 :I'll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late.
 :
 :What should he do here?
 :
 :AENEAS  Ho, nay, then! Come, come, you'll do him
 :wrong ere you are ware. You'll be so true to him to
S:be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet go
 :
 :fetch him hither. Go.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Troilus.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  How now? What's the matter?
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
 :My matter is so rash. There is at hand
 :Paris your brother and Deiphobus,
 :The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
S:
 :Delivered to us; and for him forthwith,
 :
 :Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
 :
 :We must give up to Diomedes' hand
 :
S:The Lady Cressida.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Is it so concluded?
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :By Priam and the general state of Troy.
 :They are at hand and ready to effect it.
 :
S:TROILUS  How my achievements mock me!
 :
 :I will go meet them. And, my Lord Aeneas,
 :
 :We met by chance; you did not find me here.
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
 :Have not more gift in taciturnity.
 :[Troilus and Aeneas exit.]
 :
S:
 :PANDARUS  Is 't possible? No sooner got but lost? The
 :
S:devil take Antenor! The young prince will go mad.

S:neck!

 :Gone? Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?

S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O the gods! What's the matter?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst
 :ne'er been born! I knew thou wouldst be his death.
 :O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I
 :
 :beseech you, what's the matter?
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Thou must be gone, wench; thou must be
 :gone. Thou art changed for Antenor. Thou must to
 :thy father and be gone from Troilus. 'Twill be his
 :death; 'twill be his bane. He cannot bear it.
 :
 :CRESSIDA
S:
 :O you immortal gods! I will not go.
 :
 :
 :
 :PANDARUS  Thou must.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father.
 :I know no touch of consanguinity,
 :No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
S:
 :As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,
 :
 :Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood
 :
 :If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death
 :
 :Do to this body what extremes you can,
 :But the strong base and building of my love
 :Is as the very center of the Earth,
 :Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep--
 :
S:
S:PANDARUS  Do, do.
 :

 :Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,
 :Crack my clear voice with sobs, and break my heart

 :
 :Makes me afeard.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  O heavens, you love me not!
 :
 :TROILUS  Die I a villain then!
 :In this I do not call your faith in question
S:So mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,
 :
 :Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
 :
S:Nor play at subtle games--fair virtues all,
 :
 :To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant.
 :
 :But I can tell that in each grace of these
 :
 :There lurks a still and dumb-discursive devil
 :That tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Do you think I will?
 :
S:
 :
 :TROILUS  No.
 :
 :But something may be done that we will not,
 :
 :And sometimes we are devils to ourselves
 :When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
 :Presuming on their changeful potency.
 :
 :AENEAS, [within]
 :Nay, good my lord--
S:
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Come, kiss, and let us part.
 :
 :[They kiss.]
 :
 :
 :PARIS, [within]
 :Brother Troilus!
S:
 :
 :TROILUS, [calling]  Good brother, come you hither,
 :
S:And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  My lord, will you be true?
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault.
S:Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
 :
 :I with great truth catch mere simplicity.
 :
 :Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
 :
 :With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
 :Fear not my truth. The moral of my wit
 :Is "plain and true"; there's all the reach of it.
 :
 :[Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus, and
 :Diomedes.]
S:
 :
 :
 :Welcome, Sir Diomed. Here is the lady
 :
 :Which for Antenor we deliver you.
 :
S:At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand
 :
 :And by the way possess thee what she is.
 :
 :Entreat her fair and, by my soul, fair Greek,
 :
 :If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
S:Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
 :
 :As Priam is in Ilium.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Fair Lady Cressid,
 :So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.
 :The luster in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
 :Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed
 :You shall be mistress and command him wholly.
 :
S:
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
 :
 :To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
 :
S:In praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,
 :
 :She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
 :
S:As thou unworthy to be called her servant.
 :
 :I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,
 :
S:For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
 :
 :Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
 :
 :I'll cut thy throat.
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  O, be not moved, Prince Troilus.
 :Let me be privileged by my place and message
 :To be a speaker free. When I am hence,
S:I'll answer to my lust, and know you, lord,
 :
S:I'll nothing do on charge. To her own worth
 :
 :She shall be prized; but that you say "Be 't so,"
 :
S:I speak it in my spirit and honor: "no."
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
 :This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.--
S:Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
 :
S:To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
 :
 :[Cressida, Diomedes, and Troilus exit.]

 :Hark, Hector's trumpet.
 :
 :AENEAS  How have we spent this
S:
 :morning!

 :
S:

 :
S:'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come to field with him.
 :
 :

 :Scene 5
 :
 :=======
S:[Enter Ajax, armed, Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon,
 :
 :Menelaus, Ulysses, Nestor, etc. and Trumpeter.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON, [to Ajax]
 :Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
 :Anticipating time with starting courage.
S:Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
 :
 :Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air
 :
S:May pierce the head of the great combatant
 :
 :And hale him hither.
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX  Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
 :[He gives money to Trumpeter.]
 :Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe.
 :Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
 :Outswell the colic of puffed Aquilon.
 :Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood.
S:
 :Thou blowest for Hector.	[Sound trumpet.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :No trumpet answers.
 :
 :ACHILLES  'Tis but early days.
 :
 :[Enter Cressida and Diomedes.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
S:AGAMEMNON
 :
S:Is not yond Diomed with Calchas' daughter?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
S:'Tis he. I ken the manner of his gait.
 :
 :He rises on the toe; that spirit of his
 :
 :In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :Is this the Lady Cressid?
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Even she.
S:
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
 :
 :[He kisses her.]
 :
S:NESTOR
 :
 :Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Yet is the kindness but particular.
 :'Twere better she were kissed in general.
 :
 :NESTOR
 :And very courtly counsel. I'll begin.	[He kisses her.]
S:
S:So much for Nestor.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
S:I'll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.
 :
 :Achilles bids you welcome.	[He kisses her.]
 :
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :I had good argument for kissing once.
 :
 :PATROCLUS, [stepping between Menelaus and Cressida]
 :But that's no argument for kissing now,
 :For thus popped Paris in his hardiment
S:
 :And parted thus you and your argument.
 :
 :[He kisses her.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES
 :
S:O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns,
 :
 :For which we lose our heads to gild his horns!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :The first was Menelaus' kiss; this mine.
 :Patroclus kisses you.	[He kisses her again.]
 :
S:MENELAUS  O, this is trim!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS
 :
 :Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
S:
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :
 :I'll have my kiss, sir.--Lady, by your leave.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :In kissing, do you render or receive?
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :Both take and give.
S:
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  I'll make my match to live,
 :
 :The kiss you take is better than you give.
 :
 :Therefore no kiss.
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :I'll give you boot: I'll give you three for one.
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :You are an odd man. Give even, or give none.
S:
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :
 :An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :No, Paris is not, for you know 'tis true
 :That you are odd, and he is even with you.
 :
S:
 :MENELAUS
 :
 :You fillip me o' th' head.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  No, I'll be sworn.
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :It were no match, your nail against his horn.
 :May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
S:
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :You may.
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  I do desire it.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Why, beg two.
 :
S:
 :ULYSSES
 :
S:Why, then, for Venus' sake, give me a kiss
 :
 :When Helen is a maid again and his.
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :Lady, a word. I'll bring you to your father.
S:
 :[Diomedes and Cressida talk aside.]
 :
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
 :A woman of quick sense.
 :
S:ULYSSES  Fie, fie upon her!
 :
 :There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;
 :
 :Nay, her foot speaks. Her wanton spirits look out
 :
S:At every joint and motive of her body.
 :
 :O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
 :
 :That give accosting welcome ere it comes
 :
 :And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
 :To every tickling reader! Set them down
 :For sluttish spoils of opportunity
 :And daughters of the game.
 :[Diomedes and Cressida exit.]
 :[Flourish.]
S:
 :
 :
 :ALL
 :
 :The Trojan's trumpet.
 :
 :
 :[Enter all of Troy: Hector, armed, Paris, Aeneas,
 :Helenus, Troilus, and Attendants.]
 :
 :
S:
S:AGAMEMNON  Yonder comes the troop.
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS
 :
 :Hail, all the state of Greece! What shall be done
S:To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose
 :
 :A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
 :
 :Shall to the edge of all extremity
 :
 :Pursue each other, or shall they be divided
 :By any voice or order of the field?
 :Hector bade ask.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Which way would Hector have it?
 :
S:
 :AENEAS
 :
 :He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :'Tis done like Hector.
 :
 :ACHILLES  But securely done,
 :A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
S:
 :The knight opposed.
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  If not Achilles, sir,
 :
 :What is your name?
 :
 :ACHILLES  If not Achilles, nothing.
 :
 :AENEAS
S:
 :Therefore Achilles. But whate'er, know this:
 :
 :In the extremity of great and little,
 :
 :Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector,
 :
 :The one almost as infinite as all,
 :The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
 :And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
 :This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood,
S:In love whereof half Hector stays at home;
 :
 :Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
 :
 :This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
 :
 :[Enter Diomedes.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :Here is Sir Diomed.--Go, gentle knight;
 :
 :Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas
 :Consent upon the order of their fight,
 :So be it, either to the uttermost
 :Or else a breath. The combatants being kin
 :Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
S:
 :
 :
 :[Hector and Ajax enter the lists.]
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES  They are opposed already.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
 :Not yet mature, yet matchless firm of word,
 :Speaking in deeds, and deedless in his tongue,
S:
 :Not soon provoked, nor being provoked soon calmed,
 :
 :His heart and hand both open and both free.
 :
 :For what he has, he gives; what thinks, he shows;
 :
S:Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
 :
 :Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
 :
 :Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,
 :
 :For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
 :To tender objects, but he in heat of action
 :Is more vindicative than jealous love.
 :They call him Troilus, and on him erect
 :A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
S:Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth
 :
 :Even to his inches, and with private soul
 :
 :Did in great Ilium thus translate him to me.
 :
 :[Alarum. The fight begins.]
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  They are in action.
 :
 :NESTOR  Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
S:
 :
 :TROILUS  Hector, thou sleep'st. Awake thee!
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
S:His blows are well disposed.--There, Ajax!
 :
 :[Trumpets cease.]
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:You must no more.
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  Princes, enough, so please you.
 :
 :
 :AJAX
 :I am not warm yet. Let us fight again.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :As Hector pleases.
S:
 :
 :
 :HECTOR  Why, then, will I no more.--
 :
 :Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
 :
 :A cousin-german to great Priam's seed.
 :The obligation of our blood forbids
 :A gory emulation 'twixt us twain.
 :Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
S:That thou couldst say "This hand is Grecian all,
 :
 :And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
 :
 :All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
 :
 :Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
 :Bounds in my father's," by Jove multipotent,
 :Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
 :Wherein my sword had not impressure made
 :Of our rank feud. But the just gods gainsay
 :That any drop thou borrowd'st from thy mother,
S:
 :My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
 :
S:Be drained. Let me embrace thee, Ajax.
 :
 :By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms!
 :
 :Hector would have them fall upon him thus.
 :
 :Cousin, all honor to thee!	[They embrace.]
 :
 :AJAX  I thank thee, Hector.
 :Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
 :I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
 :A great addition earned in thy death.
S:
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :Not Neoptolemus so mirable--
 :
 :On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st "Oyez"
 :Cries "This is he"--could promise to himself
 :A thought of added honor torn from Hector.
 :
 :AENEAS
S:
 :There is expectance here from both the sides
 :
 :What further you will do.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR  We'll answer it;
 :The issue is embracement.--Ajax, farewell.
S:[They embrace again.]
 :
 :
 :
 :AJAX
 :
 :If I might in entreaties find success,
 :As seld I have the chance, I would desire
 :My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:'Tis Agamemnon's wish; and great Achilles
 :
 :Doth long to see unarmed the valiant Hector.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
 :And signify this loving interview
 :To the expecters of our Trojan part;
 :Desire them home.
 :[Aeneas speaks to Trojans, who exit; he then
S:
 :returns with Troilus.]
 :
 :[To Ajax.] Give me thy hand, my cousin.
 :
 :I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
 :
 :[Agamemnon and the rest come forward.]
 :
 :AJAX
 :Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
 :
S:
 :HECTOR, [to Aeneas]
 :
 :The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
 :
 :But for Achilles, my own searching eyes
 :
 :Shall find him by his large and portly size.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :Worthy all arms! As welcome as to one
 :That would be rid of such an enemy--
S:
 :But that's no welcome. Understand more clear:
 :
 :What's past and what's to come is strewed with husks
 :
S:And formless ruin of oblivion;
 :
S:But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
 :
 :Strained purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
 :
 :Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
 :
 :From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
S:
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
S:I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
 :
 :
 :
S:AGAMEMNON, [to Troilus]
 :
 :My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you.
 :
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
 :You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
 :
 :HECTOR, [to Aeneas]
 :Who must we answer?
S:
 :
 :
 :AENEAS  The noble Menelaus.
 :
 :
 :
S:HECTOR
 :
 :O, you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
 :
 :Mock not that I affect th' untraded oath;
 :
 :Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove.
 :She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
 :
 :MENELAUS
S:Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR  O, pardon! I offend.
 :
S:
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
S:I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,
 :
 :Laboring for destiny, make cruel way
 :
 :Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen
 :
 :thee,
 :As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
 :Despising many forfeits and subduments,
 :When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air,
 :Not letting it decline on the declined,
S:That I have said to some my standers-by
 :
 :"Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!"
 :
 :And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
 :
 :When that a ring of Greeks have hemmed thee in,
S:Like an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen.
 :
 :But this thy countenance, still locked in steel,
 :
 :I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire
 :
 :And once fought with him; he was a soldier good,
 :But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
 :Never like thee! O, let an old man embrace thee;
 :And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
 :
 :AENEAS, [to Hector]  'Tis the old Nestor.
S:
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle
 :
S:That hast so long walked hand in hand with time.
 :
 :Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
 :
 :[They embrace.]
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :I would my arms could match thee in contention
 :As they contend with thee in courtesy.
 :
 :HECTOR  I would they could.
S:
 :
 :
 :NESTOR
 :
 :Ha! By this white beard, I'd fight with thee tomorrow.
 :
S:Well, welcome, welcome. I have seen the time!
 :
S:
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :I wonder now how yonder city stands
 :
 :When we have here her base and pillar by us.
 :
 :HECTOR
 :I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.
 :Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead
 :Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
S:
 :In Ilium, on your Greekish embassy.
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES
 :
 :Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.
 :
 :My prophecy is but half his journey yet,
 :
 :For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
 :Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
 :Must kiss their own feet.
 :
 :HECTOR  I must not believe you.
 :There they stand yet, and modestly I think
S:
 :The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
 :
 :A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,
 :
 :And that old common arbitrator, Time,
 :
 :Will one day end it.
 :
 :ULYSSES  So to him we leave it.
S:Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.
 :
 :After the General, I beseech you next
 :
 :To feast with me and see me at my tent.
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
S:I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!--
 :
 :Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
 :
 :I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
 :
 :And quoted joint by joint.
 :
S:HECTOR  Is this Achilles?
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  I am Achilles.
 :
S:
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
S:Stand fair, I pray thee. Let me look on thee.
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :Behold thy fill.
 :
 :HECTOR  Nay, I have done already.
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :Thou art too brief. I will the second time,
S:
 :As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :O, like a book of sport thou 'lt read me o'er;
 :But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
 :Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
 :
S:Shall I destroy him--whether there, or there, or
 :
 :there--
 :
 :That I may give the local wound a name
 :
 :And make distinct the very breach whereout
 :Hector's great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens!
 :
 :HECTOR
 :It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
S:To answer such a question. Stand again.
 :
 :Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
 :
 :As to prenominate in nice conjecture
 :
 :Where thou wilt hit me dead?
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  I tell thee, yea.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
S:I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,
 :
 :For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,
 :
 :But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
 :
 :I'll kill thee everywhere, yea, o'er and o'er.--
 :You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
 :His insolence draws folly from my lips.
 :But I'll endeavor deeds to match these words,
 :Or may I never--
S:
 :
 :AJAX  Do not chafe thee, cousin.--
 :
 :And you, Achilles, let these threats alone
 :
 :Till accident or purpose bring you to 't.
 :You may have every day enough of Hector
 :If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
 :Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
 :
 :HECTOR, [to Achilles]
S:
 :I pray you, let us see you in the field.
 :
 :We have had pelting wars since you refused
 :
 :The Grecians' cause.
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES  Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
 :Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
 :Tonight all friends.
 :
S:
 :HECTOR  Thy hand upon that match.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON
 :
 :First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
 :There in the full convive we. Afterwards,
 :As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
S:Concur together, severally entreat him.
 :
 :Beat loud the taborins; let the trumpets blow,
 :
 :That this great soldier may his welcome know.
 :
 :[Flourish.]

 :
 :TROILUS
 :My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
 :In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
S:
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :
 :At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus.
 :
S:There Diomed doth feast with him tonight,
 :
 :Who neither looks upon the heaven nor Earth,
 :
 :But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
 :
 :On the fair Cressid.
 :
 :TROILUS
 :Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
 :After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
 :To bring me thither?
S:
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  You shall command me, sir.
 :
 :As gentle tell me, of what honor was
 :
S:This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
 :
 :That wails her absence?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :O sir, to such as boasting show their scars
S:A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
 :
 :She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth;
 :
 :But still sweet love is food for Fortune's tooth.

 :THERSITES  Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
S:
 :[Achilles takes the letter and moves aside to read it.]
 :
S:
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Who keeps the tent now?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  The surgeon's box or the patient's wound.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Well said, adversity. And what need these
 :tricks?
 :
S:THERSITES  Prithee, be silent, boy. I profit not by thy
 :
 :talk. Thou art said to be Achilles' male varlet.
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  "Male varlet," you rogue! What's that?
 :
 :THERSITES  Why, his masculine whore. Now the rotten
S:diseases of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures,
 :
 :catarrhs, loads o' gravel in the back, lethargies,
 :
 :cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, whissing
 :
 :lungs, bladders full of impostume, sciaticas,
 :limekilns i' th' palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
 :rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
 :again such preposterous discoveries.
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou,
S:
 :what means thou to curse thus?
 :
 :
 :
S:THERSITES  Do I curse thee?
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Why, no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
 :
 :indistinguishable cur, no.
 :
 :THERSITES  No? Why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
 :immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarsenet
 :flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's purse,
 :thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered with such
S:
 :waterflies, diminutives of nature!
 :
 :
 :
 :PATROCLUS  Out, gall!
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Finch egg!
 :
 :ACHILLES, [coming forward]
 :My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
S:
 :From my great purpose in tomorrow's battle.
 :
 :Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
 :
 :A token from her daughter, my fair love,
 :
 :Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
 :An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.
 :Fall, Greeks; fail, fame; honor, or go or stay;
S:My major vow lies here; this I'll obey.
 :
 :Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent.
 :
 :This night in banqueting must all be spent.
 :
 :Away, Patroclus.	[He exits with Patroclus.]
 :
S:THERSITES  With too much blood and too little brain,
 :
 :these two may run mad; but if with too much brain
 :
 :and too little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
 :
 :Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough
 :and one that loves quails, but he has not so much
 :brain as earwax. And the goodly transformation
 :of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull--the primitive
S:statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a
 :
 :thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his
 :
 :brother's leg--to what form but that he is should
 :
 :wit larded with malice and malice forced with
 :wit turn him to? To an ass were nothing; he is both
 :ass and ox. To an ox were nothing; he is both ox
 :and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a
S:toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without
 :
S:a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus! I
 :
 :would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I
 :
 :would be, if I were not Thersites, for I care not to be
 :
S:the louse of a lazar so I were not Menelaus.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Hector, Troilus, Ajax, Agamemnon, Ulysses,
 :
 :Nestor, Menelaus, and Diomedes, with lights.]
 :
 :Heyday! Sprites and fires!
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  We go wrong, we go wrong.
 :
S:
S:AJAX
 :
 :No, yonder--'tis there, where we see the lights.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR  I trouble you.
S:
 :
 :AJAX  No, not a whit.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Achilles.]
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [to Hector]  Here comes himself to guide you.
 :
S:ACHILLES
 :
 :Welcome, brave Hector. Welcome, princes all.
 :
 :
 :
 :AGAMEMNON, [to Hector]
 :So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
 :Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
 :
 :HECTOR
 :Thanks, and good night to the Greeks' general.
S:
 :
 :
 :MENELAUS
 :
 :Good night, my lord.
 :
 :
 :HECTOR  Good night, sweet lord
 :Menelaus.
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  Sweet draught. "Sweet," quoth he?
S:
 :Sweet sink, sweet sewer.
 :
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
 :
 :That go or tarry.
 :
 :AGAMEMNON  Good night.
S:[Agamemnon and Menelaus exit.]
 :
 :
 :
 :ACHILLES
 :
 :Old Nestor tarries, and you too, Diomed.
S:Keep Hector company an hour or two.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :I cannot, lord. I have important business,
S:The tide whereof is now.--Good night, great Hector.
 :
S:
 :
 :HECTOR  Give me your hand.
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
 :
 :Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas' tent.
 :
 :I'll keep you company.
 :
 :
S:TROILUS  Sweet sir, you honor me.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :And so, good night.
 :[Diomedes exits, followed by Troilus and Ulysses.]
S:
 :
 :ACHILLES  Come, come, enter my tent.
 :
 :[Achilles, Ajax, Nestor, and Hector exit.]
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES  That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue,
 :
 :a most unjust knave. I will no more trust him when
 :
 :he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses. He
 :will spend his mouth and promise like Brabbler
 :the hound, but when he performs, astronomers
S:foretell it; it is prodigious, there will come some
 :
 :change. The sun borrows of the moon when
 :
S:Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see
 :
 :Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a
 :
 :Trojan drab and uses the traitor Calchas his tent.
 :
 :I'll after. Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!
 :[He exits.]

 :Scene 2
 :=======
 :[Enter Diomedes.]
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  What, are you up here, ho? Speak.
 :
 :
 :CALCHAS, [within]  Who calls?
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Diomed. Calchas, I think? Where's your
S:daughter?
 :
 :
 :
 :CALCHAS, [within]  She comes to you.
 :
 :
 :[Enter Troilus and Ulysses, at a distance, and then,
 :apart from them, Thersites.]
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
S:
 :Stand where the torch may not discover us.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cressida.]
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
 :Cressid comes forth to him.
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES  How now, my charge?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Now, my sweet guardian. Hark, a word with you.
 :[She whispers to him.]
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  Yea, so familiar?
S:
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  She will sing any man at
 :
 :first sight.
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  And any man may sing her, if he
S:can take her clef. She's noted.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Will you remember?
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Remember? Yes.
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Nay, but do, then, and let your mind be
 :coupled with your words.
 :
S:
 :TROILUS, [aside]  What should she remember?
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  List!
 :
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA
 :
S:Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  Roguery!
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Nay, then--
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  I'll tell you what--
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :Foh, foh, come, tell a pin! You are forsworn.
 :
S:CRESSIDA
 :
 :In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  A juggling trick: to be secretly open!
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
S:What did you swear you would bestow on me?
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath.
S:Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Good night.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  Hold, patience!
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  How now, Trojan?
S:
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Diomed--
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :No, no, good night. I'll be your fool no more.
S:
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  Thy better must.
 :
S:
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Hark, a word in your ear.
 :
 :[She whispers to him.]
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  O plague and madness!
 :
S:ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
 :
 :You are moved, prince. Let us depart, I pray you,
 :
 :Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
 :
 :To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous;
 :The time right deadly. I beseech you, go.
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
S:Behold, I pray you.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  Nay, good my lord, go off.
 :
 :You flow to great distraction. Come, my lord.
 :
S:TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
 :
 :I prithee, stay.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  You have not patience. Come.
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
 :I pray you, stay. By hell and all hell's torments,
 :I will not speak a word.
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :And so good night.	[He starts to leave.]
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA  Nay, but you part in anger.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  Doth that grieve thee? O withered
 :
 :truth!
S:
 :
S:ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
 :
S:How now, my lord?
 :
 :
 :
S:TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]  By Jove, I will be patient.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :Guardian! Why, Greek!
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Foh foh! Adieu. You palter.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
 :You shake, my lord, at something. Will you go?
 :You will break out.
S:
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  She strokes his cheek!
 :
 :
 :
S:ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  Come, come.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
 :
 :Nay, stay. By Jove, I will not speak a word.
 :There is between my will and all offenses
 :A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  How the devil Luxury, with his fat
 :rump and potato finger, tickles these together.
S:
S:Fry, lechery, fry!
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  But will you, then?
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :In faith, I will, la. Never trust me else.
 :
S:DIOMEDES
 :
 :Give me some token for the surety of it.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  I'll fetch you one.	[She exits.]
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]
 :You have sworn patience.
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]  Fear me not, my lord.
S:
 :I will not be myself nor have cognition
 :
 :Of what I feel. I am all patience.
 :
 :
 :
 :[Enter Cressida with Troilus's sleeve.]
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  Now the pledge, now, now, now!
 :
S:
 :CRESSIDA, [giving the sleeve]  Here, Diomed. Keep this
 :
 :sleeve.
 :
 :
 :
S:TROILUS, [aside]  O beauty, where is thy faith?
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES, [aside to Troilus]  My lord--
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside to Ulysses]
 :I will be patient; outwardly I will.
 :
 :CRESSIDA
S:You look upon that sleeve? Behold it well.
 :
 :He loved me--O false wench!--Give 't me again.
 :
 :[She snatches the sleeve from Diomedes.]
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Whose was 't?
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :It is no matter, now I ha 't again.
S:I will not meet with you tomorrow night.
 :
 :I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
 :
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  Now she sharpens. Well said,
 :whetstone.
 :
 :DIOMEDES  I shall have it.
 :
 :CRESSIDA  What, this?
S:
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Ay, that.
 :
 :
 :
S:CRESSIDA
 :
 :O all you gods!--O pretty, pretty pledge!
 :
 :Thy master now lies thinking on his bed
 :
 :Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
 :And gives memorial dainty kisses to it
 :As I kiss thee.
 :[He grabs the sleeve, and she tries to retrieve it.]
 :
S:DIOMEDES  Nay, do not snatch it from me.
 :
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :
 :He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
S:I had your heart before. This follows it.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]  I did swear patience.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not.
S:I'll give you something else.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  I will have this. Whose was it?
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  It is no matter.
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Come, tell me whose it was.
 :
 :CRESSIDA
S:
 :'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
 :
S:But now you have it, take it.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  Whose was it?
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
 :And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
 :
 :DIOMEDES
S:
 :Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm
 :
S:And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS, [aside]
 :
 :Wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn,
 :It should be challenged.
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past. And yet it is not.
 :I will not keep my word.
S:
 :
 :
S:DIOMEDES  Why, then, farewell.
 :
 :Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
 :
 :[He starts to leave.]
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :You shall not go. One cannot speak a word
S:But it straight starts you.
 :
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  I do not like this fooling.
 :
 :
S:TROILUS, [aside]
 :
 :Nor I, by Pluto! But that that likes not you
 :
 :Pleases me best.
 :
 :
 :DIOMEDES  What, shall I come? The hour?
 :
 :CRESSIDA
 :Ay, come.--O Jove!--Do, come.--I shall be plagued.
S:
 :
 :DIOMEDES
 :
 :Farewell, till then.
 :
 :
 :CRESSIDA  Good night. I prithee, come.--
 :[He exits.]
 :Troilus, farewell. One eye yet looks on thee,
 :But with my heart the other eye doth see.
 :Ah, poor our sex! This fault in us I find:
S:
 :The error of our eye directs our mind.
 :
 :What error leads must err. O, then conclude:
 :
 :Minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude.	[She exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]
 :
 :A proof of strength she could not publish more,
 :
 :Unless she said "My mind is now turned whore."
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:All's done, my lord.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  It is.
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  Why stay we then?
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :To make a recordation to my soul
 :
 :Of every syllable that here was spoke.
 :
 :But if I tell how these two did co-act,
 :Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
 :Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
 :An esperance so obstinately strong.
S:That doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears,
 :
S:As if those organs had deceptious functions,
 :
 :Created only to calumniate.
 :
 :Was Cressid here?
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  I cannot conjure, Trojan.
 :
 :TROILUS  She was not, sure.
 :
S:ULYSSES  Most sure she was.
 :
 :
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now.
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :Let it not be believed for womanhood!
 :
 :Think, we had mothers. Do not give advantage
 :
 :To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme
S:For depravation, to square the general sex
 :
 :By Cressid's rule. Rather, think this not Cressid.
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES
 :What hath she done, prince, that can soil our
S:mothers?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :
 :Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  Will he swagger himself out on 's
 :own eyes?
 :
 :TROILUS
S:
 :This she? No, this is Diomed's Cressida.
 :
 :If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
 :
 :If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
 :
 :If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
 :If there be rule in unity itself,
 :This is not she. O madness of discourse,
S:That cause sets up with and against itself!
 :
 :Bifold authority, where reason can revolt
 :
 :Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
 :
 :Without revolt. This is and is not Cressid.
 :Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
 :Of this strange nature, that a thing inseparate
 :Divides more wider than the sky and Earth,
 :And yet the spacious breadth of this division
 :Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
S:
 :As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
 :
 :Instance, O instance, strong as Pluto's gates,
 :
 :Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven;
 :
S:Instance, O instance, strong as heaven itself,
 :
 :The bonds of heaven are slipped, dissolved, and
 :
 :loosed,
 :
 :And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
 :The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
 :The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
 :Of her o'er-eaten faith are given to Diomed.
 :
 :ULYSSES
S:
 :May worthy Troilus be half attached
 :
 :With that which here his passion doth express?
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well
 :In characters as red as Mars his heart
 :Inflamed with Venus. Never did young man fancy
 :With so eternal and so fixed a soul.
S:
 :Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
 :
S:So much by weight hate I her Diomed.
 :
 :That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm.
 :
 :Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
 :
 :My sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout
 :Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
 :Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
S:Shall dizzy with more clamor Neptune's ear
 :
 :In his descent than shall my prompted sword
 :
 :Falling on Diomed.
 :
 :
 :THERSITES, [aside]  He'll tickle it for his concupy.
S:
 :
S:TROILUS
 :
 :O Cressid! O false Cressid! False, false, false!
 :
 :Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
 :
 :And they'll seem glorious.
 :
 :ULYSSES  O, contain yourself.
S:Your passion draws ears hither.
 :
 :
 :
S:[Enter Aeneas.]
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :AENEAS, [to Troilus]
 :I have been seeking you this hour, my lord.
 :Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy.
 :Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
 :
 :TROILUS
S:
 :Have with you, prince.--My courteous lord, adieu.--
 :
S:Farewell, revolted fair!--And, Diomed,
 :
 :Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
 :
 :
 :
 :ULYSSES  I'll bring you to the gates.
S:
 :
 :TROILUS  Accept distracted thanks.
 :
 :[Troilus, Aeneas, and Ulysses exit.]
 :
 :
 :THERSITES  Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I
 :would croak like a raven; I would bode, I would
 :bode. Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence
 :of this whore. The parrot will not do more
S:for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
 :
 :Lechery, lechery, still wars and lechery! Nothing
 :
S:else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!

S:=======
 :
 :[Enter Hector, armed, and Andromache.]
 :
S:
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDROMACHE
 :
 :When was my lord so much ungently tempered
 :To stop his ears against admonishment?
 :Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today.
 :
 :HECTOR
S:You train me to offend you. Get you in.
 :
 :By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
 :
 :
 :
 :ANDROMACHE
S:My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day.
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :No more, I say.
 :
 :[Enter Cassandra.]
 :
 :
 :CASSANDRA  Where is my brother Hector?
S:
 :
 :
 :ANDROMACHE
 :
 :Here, sister, armed and bloody in intent.
 :
S:Consort with me in loud and dear petition;
 :
 :Pursue we him on knees. For I have dreamt
 :
 :Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
 :
 :Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
S:
 :
 :CASSANDRA
 :
 :O, 'tis true!
 :
 :
 :HECTOR, [calling out]  Ho! Bid my trumpet sound!
 :
S:CASSANDRA
 :
 :No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!
 :
 :
 :
 :HECTOR
 :Begone, I say. The gods have heard me swear.
 :
S:CASSANDRA
 :
 :The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows.
 :
 :They are polluted off'rings more abhorred
 :
 :Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
 :
 :ANDROMACHE, [to Hector]
 :O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy
 :To hurt by being just. It is as lawful,
 :For we would give much, to use violent thefts
S:
 :And rob in the behalf of charity.
 :
S:
 :
 :CASSANDRA
 :
 :It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,
 :
 :But vows to every purpose must not hold.
 :Unarm, sweet Hector.
S:
 :
 :HECTOR  Hold you still, I say.
 :
 :Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate.
 :
 :Life every man holds dear, but the dear man
 :Holds honor far more precious-dear than life.
 :
S:[Enter Troilus, armed.]
 :
 :
 :
 :How now, young man? Meanest thou to fight today?
 :
 :
 :ANDROMACHE
 :Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
S:[Cassandra exits.]
 :
S:
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
S:No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth.
 :
S:I am today i' th' vein of chivalry.
 :
S:Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
 :
 :And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
 :
 :Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
 :
 :I'll stand today for thee and me and Troy.
 :
 :TROILUS
 :Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you
 :Which better fits a lion than a man.
S:
 :
 :HECTOR
 :
 :What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it.
 :
 :
 :TROILUS
 :When many times the captive Grecian falls,
 :Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
 :You bid them rise and live.
 :
S:
 :HECTOR
 :
 :O, 'tis fair play.
 :
 :
 :
 :TROILUS  Fool's play, by heaven. Hector.
 :
 :HECTOR
 :How now? How now?
 :
S:
 :TROILUS  For th' love of all the gods,
 :
 :Let's leave the hermit Pity with our mother,
 :
 :And when we have our armors buckled on,

 :shall leave you one o' these days. And I have a
 :rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my
S:bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell

 :Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart.
 :Th' effect doth operate another way.

 :I'll go look on. That dissembling abominable varlet,
 :Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting foolish
 :young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his helm.
S:
 :I would fain see them meet, that that same young
 :
 :Trojan ass that loves the whore there might send
 :
 :that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve
 :
S:back to the dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless

 :errand. O' th' t'other side, the policy of those
 :
 :crafty swearing rascals--that stale old mouse-eaten
 :
 :dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox,
S:Ulysses--is proved not worth a blackberry. They
 :
 :set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against
 :
S:that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles. And now is the
 :
 :cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will
 :
 :not arm today, whereupon the Grecians begin to
 :
 :proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill
 :opinion.
